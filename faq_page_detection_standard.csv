TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 on february 11, 2020 the world health organization  TAG2 announced TAG2  an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in wuhan china. the new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as covid-19. in covid-19, ‘co’ stands for ‘corona,’‘vi’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘d’ for disease. formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-ncov”. TAG1  TAG1 there are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. covid-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 spread TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how does the virus spread QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the virus that causes covid-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). TAG1  TAG1 covid-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in  TAG2 many affected geographic areas TAG2 . community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can the virus that causes covid-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of covid-19 associated with food. before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 will warm weather stop the outbreak of covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 it is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of covid-19. some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  there is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with covid-19 and investigations are ongoing. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is community spread QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. for information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website.​ TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 at this time, cdc has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. the main way that covid-19 spreads is from person to person. see  TAG2 how coronavirus spreads TAG2  for more information.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 does cdc recommend the use of facemask or face coverings to prevent covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 wear cloth face coverings in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. TAG1  TAG1 covid-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. that’s why it’s important for everyone to practice  TAG2 social distancing TAG2  (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear cloth face coverings in public settings. cloth face coverings provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people. TAG1  TAG1 the cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or n-95 respirators.  those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current cdc guidance. TAG1  TAG1 more information about cloth face coverings can be found on our cloth face coverings site.

TAG1  TAG1 contact tracing for covid-19 typically involves TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 interviewing people with covid-19 to identify everyone with whom they had close contact during the time they may have been infectious, TAG2  TAG2 notifying contacts of their potential exposure, TAG2  TAG2 referring contacts for testing, TAG2  TAG2 monitoring contacts for signs and symptoms of covid-19, and TAG2  TAG2 connecting contacts with services they might need during the self-quarantine period. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 to prevent the further spread of disease, covid-19 contacts are encouraged to stay home and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others until 14 days after their last exposure to a person with covid-19. contacts should monitor themselves by checking their temperature twice daily and watching for  TAG2 symptoms of covid-19 TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what happens during contact tracing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 generally, contact tracing includes the following steps: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 case investigation: TAG2  public health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the time when they may have been infectious. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 contact tracing: TAG2  public health staff begin contact tracing by notifying exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible, not revealing the infected patient’s identity. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 contact support: TAG2  contacts are provided with education, information, and support to help them understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, and how to monitor themselves for illness. in addition, they are informed of the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they do not feel ill. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 self-quarantine: TAG2  contacts are encouraged to stay home, monitor their health, and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others until 14 days after their last exposure to the infected patient, in case they also become ill. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 who is considered a close contact to someone with covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 for covid-19, a close contact is defined as anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient was isolated. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what can a person diagnosed with covid-19 expect to happen during contact tracing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if you are diagnosed with covid-19, a case investigator from the health department may call you to check-in on your health, discuss who you’ve been in contact with, and ask where you spent time while you may have been infectious and able to spread covid-19 to others. you will also be asked to stay at home and  TAG2 self-isolate TAG2 , if you are not doing so already. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 your name  TAG2 will not TAG2  be revealed to those you may have exposed, even if they ask. TAG2  TAG2 self-isolation means staying at home in a specific room away from other people and  TAG2 pets TAG2 , and using a separate bathroom, if possible. TAG2  TAG2 self-isolation helps slow the spread of covid-19 and can help keep your family, friends, neighbors, and others you may come in contact with healthy. TAG2  TAG2 if you need support or assistance while self-isolating, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 symptoms of covid-19 can include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. if your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care.

TAG1  TAG1 you should stay at home and  TAG2 self-quarantine TAG2  for 14 days, starting from the last day you were possibly exposed to covid-19. the contact tracer will help identify the dates of your self-quarantine. the contact tracer can also provide resources about covid-19 testing in your area. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 self-quarantine means staying home, monitoring your health, and maintaining social distancing (at least 6 feet) from others at all times. TAG2  TAG2 if you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a cloth face covering. this will help protect the people around you. TAG2  TAG2 if you need support or assistance with self-quarantine, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 you should take your temperature twice a day, watch for  TAG2 symptoms of covid-19 TAG2 , and notify your health department if you develop symptoms. you should also notify people you had close contact with recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. if your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care.

TAG2  the virus that causes covid-19 is thought to  TAG2 spread TAG2  mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. this type of spread is not a concern after death. TAG1  TAG1 it may be possible that a person can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. TAG1  TAG1 people should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of covid-19. older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe illness from covid-19. there may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. if washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. at a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. if splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (ppe) may be required (such as disposable gown, face shield, or goggles and n-95 respirator). TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how can loved ones safely handle belongings of someone who died from covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if desired, you may retrieve the belongings of a loved one who has died of covid-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting). depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility. TAG1  TAG1 you should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling your loved ones’ belongings. depending on the type of belongings, such as electronics, you should also follow the  TAG2 household item-specific cleaning and disinfection guidelines TAG2  when handling these items.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 my family member died from covid-19 while overseas. what are the requirements for returning the body to the united states QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cdc does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the united states. depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. there likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office. TAG1  TAG1 cdc requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a  TAG2 quarantinable communicable disease TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 at this time, covid-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the united states and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 code of federal regulations part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the united states only under the following conditions: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the remains are cremated; or TAG2  TAG2 the remains are properly embalmed and placed in a leak-proof container; or TAG2  TAG2 the remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the cdc director. the cdc permit (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment.

TAG1  TAG1 after cleaning and disinfection, the following recommendations may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 consider removing smaller rugs or carpets from the area completely, so there is less that needs to be vacuumed. TAG2  TAG2 use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (hepa) filter, if available. TAG2  TAG2 do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms. TAG2  TAG2 consider temporarily turning off room fans and the central hvac system that services the room or space, so that particles that escape from vacuuming will not circulate throughout the facility. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is routine cleaning QUESTION  how frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. more frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. for example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. cleaning  TAG2 removes  TAG2 dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 is cleaning alone effective against the virus that causes covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. if a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have covid-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 who should clean and disinfect community spaces QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (ppe) required for the chemicals used. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure QUESTION  how long before other workers can come back to work QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected covid-19 has been in a company facility. the area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i.e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. once the area has been  TAG2 appropriately disinfected TAG2 , it can be opened for use. workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected covid-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity uv radiation, and led blue light QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes covid-19 is not known. epa only recommends use of the TAG2  surface disinfectants identified on list n TAG2 external icon TAG2  TAG2  against the virus that causes covid-19. epa does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as uv lights, led lights, or ultrasonic devices. therefore, epa cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of covid-19. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of covid-19 to the public. you should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. if practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not recommended. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cdc does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. there is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of covid-19. chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cdc does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of covid-19 to the public. the risk of spreading the virus that causes covid-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what animals can get covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 we don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes covid-19. cdc is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes covid-19, mostly after close contact with people with covid-19. a tiger at a zoo in new york has also tested positive for the virus. TAG1  TAG1 recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. these findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people. TAG1  TAG1 at this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes covid-19. based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading covid-19 to people is considered to be low. further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes covid-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of covid-19.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can wild animals spread the virus that causes covid-19 to people or pets QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes covid-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the united states, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the united states. the first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the united states was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in new york city. however, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus. TAG1  TAG1 if a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by covid-19. because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance. TAG1  TAG1 take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the united states: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. TAG2  TAG2 do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. TAG2  TAG2 always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside.

TAG2 there have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes covid-19.  TAG2 based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes covid-19 to people is considered to be low. covid-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick.  TAG2 employees should not return to work until the  TAG2 criteria to discontinue home isolation TAG2  are met, after talking with their doctor. implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 consider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises.  TAG2 people with a fever of 100.4 TAG2 0 TAG2 (38.0 TAG2 0 TAG2 c) or above or other  TAG2 signs of illness TAG2  should not be admitted to the premises. if implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. see  TAG2 general business faqs TAG2  for more information. TAG2  TAG2 employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 limit the number of people entering the facility.  TAG2 consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. if possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility TAG2 . whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. allow for  TAG2 social distancing TAG2  and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 visitors and employees should wear  TAG2  TAG2 cloth face coverings TAG2  to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. wearing a cloth face covering does not replace the need to practice social distancing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 set up hand hygiene stations TAG2  at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. employees should  TAG2 wash hands TAG2  regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces TAG2  such as grooming tools, halters, lead ropes, shared tack and equipment, and door handles/gates (including those to stall doors and pasture/turn out areas) on a routine basis. to disinfect, use products that meet  TAG2 epa’s criteria for use against the TAG2 external icon TAG2  TAG2  virus that causes covid-19 and are appropriate for the surface, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. follow manufacturer’s directions for use, especially regarding product contact time and protections from chemical hazards posed by cleaners and disinfectants. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 follow local guidance TAG2  on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding. TAG2  TAG2 if traveling to a new facility,  TAG2 limit contact between people, horses, tack, equipment, and other supplies TAG2  from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders. TAG2  TAG2 follow state and local guidance on travel. people who are sick should not travel to other facilities. TAG2  TAG2 people visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a cloth face covering to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water. TAG2  TAG2 if other animals, such as barn cats, are present at the facility, be aware that a small number of  TAG2 pets TAG2  have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes covid-19, mostly after contact with people with covid-19.

TAG1  TAG1 each community is unique. because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. to identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be affected need to be considered, including  TAG2 populations most vulnerable to severe illness TAG2 , and those who might be more affected socially or economically. when selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. state and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation. TAG1  TAG1 putting mitigation into practice is based on TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions TAG2  TAG2 empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness TAG2  TAG2 focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness TAG2  TAG2 minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 *cdc cannot address the policies of any business or organization. cdc shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. in all cases,  TAG2 follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department TAG2 . local decisions depend on local circumstances.

TAG1  TAG1 based on what we currently know about covid-19, the selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma has not been affected.  are available. continuation of inhaled corticosteroids is particularly important for patients already using these medications because there is no evidence of increased risk of covid-19 morbidity with use of inhaled corticosteroids and an abundance of data showing reduced risk of asthma exacerbation with maintenance of asthma controller therapy. TAG1  TAG1 patients with asthma but without symptoms or a diagnosis of covid-19 should continue any required nebulizer treatments. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 patients with hypertension TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 are patients with hypertension at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 hypertension is common in the united states. hypertension is more frequent with advancing age and among men, non-hispanic blacks, and people with other underlying medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and serious heart disease. based on what we know at this time, people with pulmonary hypertension are at increased risk for severe illness. people with hypertension (high blood pressure) may have an increased risk of severe illness from covid-19.

TAG2  TAG2 you know your patient’s overall health and how well their conditions are managed. use your clinical judgement to evaluate on a case by case basis. patients frequently in congregate settings are at increased risk of infection. patients with  TAG2 underlying medical conditions TAG2  may be at increased risk of severe disease. TAG2  TAG2 if possible, work with patients to manage their underlying condition to the best of their ability, including ensuring that patients have sufficient medication and supplies. prescribing three-month supplies of medications may help ensure access to sufficient medications. TAG2  TAG2 explain to all patients which symptoms of their chronic conditions require emergency care or in-person visits. stress the importance of obtaining emergency care if needed. TAG2  TAG2 reassure your patients who require emergency care that emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect them from acquiring covid-19 TAG2  TAG2 tell patients with  TAG2 underlying medical conditions TAG2  that increase their risk of severe illness or poorer outcomes from covid-19: TAG2  TAG2 to stay home as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed. TAG2  TAG2 closely follow their care plans for management of their chronic disease, including, for example, achieving better glycemic or blood pressure control.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (mis-c) and who is at risk QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cdc is investigating reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (mis-c) associated with covid-19. patients with mis-c have presented with a persistent fever and a variety of signs and symptoms including multiorgan (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic, neurologic) involvement and elevated inflammatory markers. cdc is collaborating with domestic and international partners to better understand this new syndrome, including how common it is and its risk factors, and to begin tracking cases. for more information, including a full case definition, visit  TAG2 mis-c information for healthcare providers TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 top of page TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 infection control TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 do cdc’s interim infection prevention and control recommendations for covid-19 apply to psychiatric hospitals or other behavioral health facilities QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 yes. to keep patients and healthcare personnel (hcp) healthy and safe, cdc’s infection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where healthcare is delivered. however, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor certain recommendations to their setting. for example, inpatient psychiatric care includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to continue. if so, these activities might need to be adapted to align with  TAG2 social distancing TAG2  recommendations. other recommended infection control measures (for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting patients with covid-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing universal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to implement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral concerns. TAG1  TAG1 challenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings might include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 cohorting TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 challenge: TAG2  to prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with covid-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated hcp. because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change hcp assigned to their care. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 potential solutions: TAG2  when cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with covid-19 and others on the unit. ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for covid-19 patients. ensure hcp wear  TAG2 all recommended personal protective equipment (ppe) TAG2  when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 group therapy sessions TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 challenge TAG2 : group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatric treatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 potential solutions TAG2 : when possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. in the event that covid-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread. TAG2  TAG2 cloth face coverings TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 challenge:  TAG2 for some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 potential solutions: TAG2  consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. ensure that hcp interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have covid-19 and respirators are available). TAG2  TAG2 alcohol-based hand sanitizer TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 challenge TAG2 : while alcohol-based hand sanitizer (abhs) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to  TAG2 hand hygiene TAG2  recommendations, abhs must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 potential solutions:  TAG2 consider not placing abhs in patients’ rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and hcp. consider providing personal, pocket-sized abhs dispensers for hcp. TAG2  TAG2 dining TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 challenge TAG2 : as part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. however, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 potential solutions TAG2 : one option is to position staff in patients’ rooms to monitor their dining. another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. a third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat. TAG2  TAG2 smoking TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 challenge: TAG2  a higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 potential solutions:  TAG2 limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spaces at the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if a long-term care facility has a resident or staff member with suspected or confirmed covid-19, how and to whom should this be communicated QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 facilities should follow the reporting requirements of their state or jurisdiction. those regulated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) (e.g., nursing homes) should also follow all  TAG2 cms requirements TAG2 pdf icon TAG2  TAG2 external icon TAG2  TAG2 , which are being updated to include new requirements for reporting to cdc and to residents and their representatives. TAG1  TAG1 in addition,  TAG2 cdc recommends TAG2  that  TAG2 health departments TAG2  be promptly notified about: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 residents or healthcare personnel (hcp) with suspected or confirmed covid-19, TAG2  TAG2 residents with severe respiratory infection resulting in hospitalization or death, and TAG2  TAG2  ≥ 3 residents or hcp with new-onset respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of each other. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 these could signal an outbreak of covid-19 or other respiratory disease in the facility. the health department can provide important guidance to assist with case finding and halting transmission. TAG1  TAG1 the facility should also have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with residents, family members, and hcp, including if cases of covid-19 are identified in the facility. often, information in nursing homes is communicated through town hall meetings and staff meetings, along with letters or emails. however, during the covid-19 pandemic, in-person gatherings should not occur. instead, communication should occur through virtual meetings over phone or web platforms. these should be supplemented with written communications that provide contact information for a staff member who can respond to questions or concerns. communications should include information describing the current situation, plans for limiting spread within the facility, and recommended actions they can take to protect themselves and others. facilities should make this information available in a timely manner and offer periodic updates as the situation develops and more information becomes available. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 is a negative test for sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, required before a hospitalized patient can be discharged to a nursing home QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 no. for patients hospitalized with sars-cov-2 infection, decisions about discharge from the hospital should be based on their clinical status and the ability of an accepting facility to meet their care needs and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices. decisions about hospital discharge are distinct from decisions about  TAG2 discontinuation of transmission-based precautions TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 for patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection, decisions about discontinuing transmission-based precautions should be based on the strategies outlined  TAG2 here TAG2 . the test-based strategy is recommended only for use in limited circumstances. TAG1  TAG1 if a patient with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection  TAG2 has not TAG2  met criteria for discontinuing transmission-based precautions, they should be transferred to a facility with the ability to adhere to  TAG2 infection prevention and control recommendations TAG2  for the care of residents with sars-cov-2 infection, including placement in a unit or area of the facility designated to care for residents with sars-cov-2 infection and provision of recommended personal protective equipment to healthcare personnel. TAG1  TAG1 if the patient  TAG2 has TAG2  met the criteria for discontinuing transmission-based precautions, they do not require additional restrictions. TAG1  TAG1 a patient hospitalized for non-covid-related illnesses who is not known to have sars-cov-2 infection can be transferred to a nursing home without testing. to ensure a patient was not exposed and might subsequently develop sars-cov-2 infection, nursing homes should place the patient in  TAG2 transmission-based precautions TAG2  in a separate observation area or in a single-person room for 14 days after admission. TAG1  TAG1 as part of  TAG2 universal source control measures TAG2 , all residents (including those described in the scenarios above) should wear a cloth face covering or facemask (if tolerated) whenever they leave their room. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 during the covid-19 pandemic, are there special considerations for surgical and other procedural care settings, including performance of aerosol-generating procedures (agps) QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as part of routine practices, healthcare personnel (hcp) should be applying  TAG2 standard precautions TAG2 . hcp should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (ppe) should be implemented at the point of care according to cdc guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed. TAG1  TAG1 to reduce sars-cov-2 exposure during the covid-19 pandemic, cdc recommends that facilities: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 consider nonoperative approaches when feasible; TAG2  TAG2 minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible; TAG2  TAG2 minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures; TAG2  TAG2 use the  TAG2 extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed TAG2  to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and TAG2  TAG2 implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having hcp wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, hcp caring for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 should adhere to all  TAG2 recommended infection prevention and control practices for covid-19 TAG2 .  this includes: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 using all recommended ppe: an n95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown. TAG2  TAG2 respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field. TAG2  TAG2 if shortages exist, n95 or equivalent or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract). TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 as part of routine practice, hcp should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e.g., smoke evacuation devices). TAG2  TAG1 because sars-cov-2 can be transmitted by individuals who are infected but do not have symptoms, some infected individuals will not be identified by screening for clinical signs and symptoms.  hcp providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having sars-cov-2 infection should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for  TAG2 universal eye protection and respirator use TAG2 .  hcp should continue to use eye protection or an n95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of standard or transmission-based precautions. TAG1  TAG1 in addition to the use of universal ppe and source control in healthcare settings, targeted sars-cov-2 testing of patients without signs or symptoms of covid-19 might be used to identify those with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection and further reduce risk for exposures in some healthcare settings. depending on guidance from local and state health departments, testing availability, and how rapidly results are available, facilities can consider implementing pre-admission or pre-procedure diagnostic testing with authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays for sars-cov-2.testing results might inform decisions about rescheduling elective procedures or about the need for additional transmission-based precautions when caring for the patient. limitations of using this testing strategy include obtaining negative results in patients during their incubation period who later become infectious and false negative test results, depending on the test method used. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why does cdc continue to recommend respiratory protection equivalent or higher to the level provided by an n95 disposable filtering facepiece respirator for care of patients with known or suspected covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cdc’s guidance to use niosh-approved n95 disposable filtering facepiece or higher level respirators when providing care for patients with suspected or known covid-19 is based on the current understanding of sars-cov-2 and related respiratory viruses. TAG1  TAG1 current data suggest that close-range aerosol transmission by droplet and inhalation, and contact followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth are likely routes of transmission. long-range aerosol transmission, such as is seen with measles, has not been a feature of sars-cov-2. TAG1  TAG1 potential routes of close-range transmission include splashes and sprays of infectious material onto mucous membranes and inhalation of infectious virions exhaled by an infected person. the relative contribution of each of these is not known for sars-co-v-2. TAG1  TAG1 facemasks commonly used during surgical procedures will provide barrier protection against droplet sprays contacting mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but they are not designed to protect wearers from inhaling small particles. n95 and higher level respirators, such as other disposable filtering facepiece respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (paprs), and elastomeric respirators, provide both barrier and respiratory protection because of their tight fit and filtration characteristics. TAG1  TAG1 respirators should be used as part of a respiratory protection program that provides staff with medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. TAG1  TAG1 although facemasks are routinely used for the care of patients with common viral respiratory infections, n95 or higher level respirators are routinely recommended for emerging pathogens like sars cov-2, which have the potential for transmission via small particles, the ability to cause severe infections, and no specific treatments or vaccines. TAG1  TAG1 cdc recommendations acknowledge the current challenges with limited supplies of n95s and other respirators. facilities that do not have sufficient supplies of n95s and other respirators for all patient care should prioritize their use for activities and procedures that pose high risks of generating infectious aerosols and use facemasks for care that does not involve those activities or procedures. detailed  TAG2 strategies for optimizing the supply of n95 respirators TAG2  are available on the cdc website. once availability of supplies is reestablished, the guidance states that the use of n95 and higher level respirators should resume. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what personal protective equipment (ppe) should be worn by individuals transporting patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection within a healthcare facility QUESTION  for example, what ppe should be worn when transporting the patient to radiology for imaging that cannot be performed in the patient room QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in general, transport and movement of a patient with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. if being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (hcp) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. for transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering (if tolerated) to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet. TAG1  TAG1 if transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear  TAG2 all recommended ppe TAG2  (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested niosh-certified disposable n95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). this recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown and gloves and perform hand hygiene. TAG1  TAG1 the transporter should continue to wear a respirator or facemask.  the continued use of eye protection by the transporter is also recommended if there is potential that the patient might not be able to tolerate their facemask or cloth face covering for the duration of transport.  additional ppe should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask). TAG1  TAG1 after arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear  TAG2 all recommended ppe TAG2 . if still wearing their original respirator or facemask and eye protection, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended ppe. this cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the united states. TAG1  TAG1 interim guidance for ems personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected sars-cov-2 infection is  TAG2 available here TAG2 . ems personnel should wear all recommended ppe because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what personal protective equipment (ppe) should be worn by environmental services (evs) personnel who clean and disinfect rooms of hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 infection QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with sars-cov-2 infection. healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. if this responsibility is assigned to evs personnel, they should wear all  TAG2 recommended ppe TAG2  when in the room. ppe should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene. TAG1  TAG1 after discharge, terminal cleaning can be performed by evs personnel. they should delay entry into the room until  TAG2 time has elapsed TAG2  for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. after this time has elapsed, evs personnel can enter the room and should wear a  TAG2 facemask TAG2  (for source control) along with a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products. shoe covers are not recommended at this time for personnel caring for patients with sars-cov-2 infection. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 some procedures performed on patients are more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing. these aerosol generating procedures (agps) potentially put healthcare personnel and others at an increased risk for pathogen exposure and infection. TAG1  TAG1 development of a comprehensive list of agps for healthcare settings has not been possible, due to limitations in available data on which procedures may generate potentially infectious aerosols and the challenges in determining if reported transmissions during agps are due to aerosols or other exposures. TAG1  TAG1 there is neither expert consensus, nor sufficient supporting data, to create a definitive and comprehensive list of agps for healthcare settings. TAG1  TAG1 commonly performed medical procedures that are often considered agps, or that create uncontrolled respiratory secretions, include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 open suctioning of airways TAG2  TAG2 non-invasive ventilation (e.g., bipap, cpap) TAG2  TAG2 bronchoscopy TAG2  TAG2 manual ventilation TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 based on limited available data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated from some procedures may be infectious, such as: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 nebulizer administration* TAG2  TAG2 high flow o2 delivery TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 *aerosols generated by nebulizers are derived from medication in the nebulizer. it is uncertain whether potential associations between performing this common procedure and increased risk of infection might be due to aerosols generated by the procedure or due to increased contact between those administering the nebulized medication and infected patients. TAG1  TAG1 references related to aerosol generating procedures: TAG1  TAG1 tran k, cimon k, severn m, pessoa-silva cl, conly j (2012) aerosol generating procedures and risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections to healthcare workers: a systematic review. plos one 7(4);  TAG2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3338532/#!po=72.2222external iconexternal icon TAG2 external icon TAG2  TAG2 ). TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how long does an examination room need to remain vacant after being occupied by a patient with confirmed or suspected covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 although spread of sars-cov-2 is believed to be primarily via respiratory droplets, the contribution of small respirable particles to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely. TAG1  TAG1 the amount of time that the air inside an examination room remains potentially infectious is not known and may depend on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an aerosol-generating procedure was performed. facilities will need to consider these factors when deciding when the vacated room can be entered by someone who is not wearing ppe. TAG1  TAG1 for a patient who was not coughing or sneezing, did not undergo an aerosol-generating procedure, and occupied the room for a short period of time (e.g., a few minutes), any risk to hcp and subsequent patients likely dissipates over a matter of minutes. however, for a patient who was coughing and remained in the room for a longer period of time or underwent an aerosol-generating procedure, the risk period is likely longer. TAG1  TAG1 for these higher risk scenarios, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period as that used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) and to restrict hcp and patients without ppe from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. TAG1  TAG1 general guidance on  TAG2 clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions TAG2  is available. TAG1  TAG1 in addition to ensuring sufficient time for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles, hcp should clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and shared equipment before the room is used for another patient. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 my hospital is experiencing a shortage of isolation gowns. to preserve our supply, can we stop using gowns for the care of patients with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and other endemic multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros), and clostridioides difficile QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cdc has released information about  TAG2 strategies to optimize the supply of isolation gowns TAG2 . healthcare facilities should refer to that guidance and implement the recommended strategies to optimize their current supply of gowns. this includes shifting toward the use of washable cloth gowns, if feasible. TAG1  TAG1 the use of gowns as part of contact precautions in the context of mdros has been implemented primarily to reduce the risk of transmission to other patients rather than to protect healthcare personnel (hcp). facilities with shortages could consider suspending the use of gowns for the care of patients with endemic mdros, such as mrsa, vre, and esbl-producing gram-negative bacilli except as required for  TAG2 standard precautions TAG2 . facilities should assess their local epidemiology to determine which mdros are considered endemic. regardless of the use of gowns, hcp at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an mdro in a private room, if available. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 caring for patients who have highly resistant gram-negative organisms (e.g., carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriacae) and other mdros (e.g.,  TAG2  TAG2 candida auris TAG2  TAG2 ) that are not considered endemic:   TAG2 rather than gowns being donned for every room entry, they should be reserved for use as part of  TAG2 standard precautions TAG2  and also prioritized for high-contact patient care activities that pose highest risk for transfer of pathogens from the patient to hcp. examples of such high-contact care activities include dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use (central line, urinary catheter, feeding tube, tracheostomy/ventilator), and wound care. to further preserve gowns, hcp are recommended to bundle high-contact care activities as part of individual care encounters.  regardless of the use of gowns, hcp at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an mdro in a private room, if available. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 caring for patients with  TAG2  TAG2 clostridioides difficile TAG2  TAG2  infections (cdi):   TAG2 facilities should continue using contact precautions (putting on a gown and gloves upon entry into the patient’s room and placing the patient in a private room) for the care of symptomatic patients with cdi.  as part of a  TAG2 supplemental strategy to prevent transmission of cdi TAG2 , some facilities have implemented contact precautions for the care of patients at high risk for cdi who have asymptomatic carriage of  TAG2 clostridioides difficile TAG2 . there are limited data about the role of asymptomatic carriage in transmission of cdi. in this setting of a critical national shortage of gowns, facilities should consider suspending this approach until the shortage is addressed. gowns should still be used as part of  TAG2 standard precautions TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 a healthcare provider at our facility was recently diagnosed with covid-19. what time period and criteria do we use to determine the patients, visitors, and other healthcare personnel (hcp) who might have been exposed to this individual while he/she was potentially infectious QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) with the infected healthcare provider might have been exposed. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if the provider had covid-19 symptoms, TAG2  the provider is considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days before symptoms first appeared until the provider meets criteria to discontinue  TAG2 transmission-based precautions TAG2  or  TAG2 home isolation TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if the provider did not have symptoms TAG2 , collecting information about when the provider may have been exposed could help inform the period when they were infectious. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if an exposure is identified TAG2 . the provider should be considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days after the exposure until criteria to discontinue  TAG2 transmission-based precautions TAG2  or  TAG2 home isolation TAG2  are met. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if the date of exposure cannot be determined TAG2 . for the purposes of contact tracing, it is reasonable to use a cutoff of 2 days before the specimen testing positive for covid-19 was collected as the starting point, continuing until the criteria to discontinue  TAG2 transmission-based precautions TAG2  or  TAG2 home isolation TAG2  are met. although the infectious period is generally accepted to be  TAG2 10 days after onset of infection TAG2 , eliciting contacts during the entire 10 days before obtaining the specimen that tested positive for covid-19 is likely inefficient.  in most situations an exposed provider cannot recall all contacts over the preceding 10 days.  also, because recent data suggest that asymptomatic persons may have a lower viral burden at diagnosis than symptomatic persons, the additional resources required may divert case investigation and contact tracing resources away from activities most likely to interrupt ongoing transmission. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 contact tracing is generally recommended for anyone who had prolonged close contact with the person with covid-19 during these time periods.  while this question addresses exposure to a potentially infectious provider, the following actions are also recommended if the potentially infectious individual is a patient or visitor. TAG1  TAG1 recommended actions for hcp, patients, and visitors: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 perform a risk assessment and apply work restrictions for other hcp who were exposed to the infected provider based on whether these hcp had prolonged, close contact  TAG2 and TAG2  what ppe they were wearing. more detailed information is available in the  TAG2 interim u.s. guidance for risk assessment and work restrictions for healthcare personnel with potential exposure to covid-19 TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 place exposed patients who are currently admitted to the healthcare facility in appropriate  TAG2 transmission-based precautions TAG2  and monitor them for onset of covid-19 until 14 days after their last exposure. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 information for health departments about case investigation and contact tracing is available in the  TAG2 health departments:  interim guidance on developing a covid-19 case investigation and contact tracing plan TAG2 pdf icon TAG2  TAG2 .  this guidance could also be helpful to healthcare facilities performing such activities. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 a healthcare provider in our facility worked while infected with sars-cov-2. however, the provider wore a facemask at all times while interacting with patients. are the patients at risk for sars-cov-2 and should they be notified QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) should be considered potentially exposed.  the use of a  TAG2 facemask TAG2  for source control and adherence to other recommended infection prevention and control (ipc) measures (e.g., hand hygiene) by the provider help to reduce the risk of transmission or severe illness. in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, patients are already at risk for exposure to sars-cov-2 due to exposures outside their home and should be alert to the development of signs or symptoms consistent with covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 the following should be considered when determining which patients are at higher risk for transmission and might be prioritized for evaluation and testing: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 facemask TAG2  use by the patient – mirroring the  TAG2 risk assessment guidance for healthcare personnel TAG2 , patients not wearing a facemask would likely be at higher risk for infection compared to those that were wearing a facemask. TAG2  TAG2 type of interaction that occurred between the patient and infected provider – an interaction involving manipulation or prolonged close contact with the patient’s eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., dental cleaning) likely poses higher risk of transmission to the patient compared to other interactions (e.g., blood pressure check). TAG2  TAG2 ppe used by infected hcp – hcp wearing a  TAG2 facemask TAG2  (or respirator) and face shield that extends down below the chin might have had better source control than wearing only a facemask. note that respirators with exhalation valves might not provide source control. TAG2  TAG2 current status of patient – is the patient currently admitted to a hospital or long-term care facility QUESTION   these individuals, if infected, can be at higher risk for severe illness and have the potential to expose large numbers of individuals at risk for severe disease. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 health departments should have a  TAG2 plan on how to prioritize facilities TAG2  when testing capacity is limited. TAG1  TAG1 priority facilities may include those with confirmed cases, those in counties with high incidence, those with the ability to cohort residents who are found to be positive, larger facilities, and facilities with more patients with recent healthcare exposures (e.g., recent hospitalization or outpatient dialysis). TAG1  TAG1 if a facility identifies additional cases through facility-wide testing, then that facility should be prioritized for repeat testing of negative residents. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should asymptomatic hcp who are tested as part of facility-wide testing be excluded from work while waiting for test results QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if hcp remain asymptomatic, they may continue working while awaiting test results, unless work restrictions have been implemented by the occupational health program because of an  TAG2 exposure warranting exclusion from work TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1 some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may  TAG2 worsen in the second week of illness TAG2 . the decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. this decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. for more information, see  TAG2 interim infection prevention and control recommendations for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a healthcare setting TAG2  and  TAG2 interim guidance for implementing home care of people not requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 is forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 based on limited data, forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor would not be expected to generate aerosols to the same extent as procedures more commonly considered to be aerosol generating (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning. forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols. TAG1  TAG1 when respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected covid-19, hcp should use respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns during the second stage of labor, in addition to other personal protective equipment that may be typically indicated for labor and delivery. for more information please see:  TAG2 healthcare infection prevention and control faqs TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 is use of high-flow oxygen considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 based on limited data, high-flow oxygen use is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning). patients with known or suspected covid-19 should receive any interventions they would normally receive as standard of care. when respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected covid-19, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be used by hcp for the care of pregnant patients with known or suspected covid-19. for more information please see:  TAG2 healthcare infection prevention and control faqs TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should intrapartum fever be considered as a possible sign of covid-19 infection QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has  TAG2 signs and symptoms TAG2  compatible with covid-19 and whether the patient should be tested. fever is the most commonly reported sign; most patients with confirmed covid-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (cough, difficulty breathing). TAG1  TAG1 data regarding covid-19 in pregnancy are limited; according to current information, presenting signs and symptoms are expected to be similar to those for non-pregnant patients, including the presence of fever. TAG1  TAG1 other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of covid-19 infections. as part of evaluation, clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness and peripartum fever. for more information please see:  TAG2 testing overview for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what guidance is available for labor and delivery hcp with potential exposure in a healthcare setting to patients with covid-19 infection QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 several patients with covid-19 have been reported to present with concurrent community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. decisions to administer antibiotics to covid-19 patients should be based on the likelihood of bacterial infection (community-acquired or hospital-acquired), illness severity, and antimicrobial stewardship issues. for more information, see  TAG2 diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia: an official clinical practice guideline of the american thoracic society and infectious diseases society of america TAG2 external icon TAG2  TAG2 external icon TAG2  TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1 different strategies are needed to ensure the delivery of newborn care and well-child care, including childhood immunizations. healthcare providers in communities affected by covid-19 are using  TAG2 strategies to separate well visits from sick visits TAG2 external icon TAG2  TAG2 . examples include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 scheduling well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon. TAG2  TAG2 separating patients spatially, such as by placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the clinic or another location from patients with well visits. TAG2  TAG2 collaborating with providers in the community to identify separate locations for holding well visits for children. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 because of personal, practice, or community circumstances related to covid-19, some providers may not be able to provide well-child care, including immunizations, for all patients in their practice.  TAG2 if a practice can provide only limited well-child visits, healthcare providers are encouraged to prioritize newborn care and vaccination of infants and young children (through 24 months of age) when possible TAG2 . cdc is monitoring the situation and will continue to provide guidance.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 under what circumstances should laboratories use either a sars-cov-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received eua from fda QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 fda has authorized euas for both viral and antibody tests for covid-19. viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of sars-cov-2 infections. in contrast, antibody tests can detect igg, iga, and igm antibodies from an immune response to sars-cov-2. TAG1  TAG1 whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of sars-cov-2 infections. however, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 most of the pcr-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). however, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. for this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. TAG1  TAG1 results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude sars-cov-2 infections or to inform infection status. negative results from antibody testing do not rule out sars-cov-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than sars-cov-2. TAG1  TAG1 if a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 my facility created a laboratory-developed test (ldt) to detect sars-cov-2. we need to have the first five positive and negative specimens confirmed. can we send these specimens to cdc QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 laboratories using an ldt to detect sars-cov-2 should confer with their state public health laboratory for assistance. if the state public health laboratory cannot assist, contact  TAG2 respvirus@cdc.gov TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 serology TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 does cdc accept specimens for antibody testing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cdc is currently performing antibody surveys to understand how covid-19 has spread in the u.s. population. cdc is not using its antibody tests for diagnostic purposes, and thus is not accepting antibody test requests intended for covid-19 patient diagnosis. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 will cdc submit its antibody test for an eua QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 not at this time. cdc is using its antibody test as part of a multi-agency study to evaluate current commercially marketed antibody tests for specificity and sensitivity and to help determine how results from antibody tests could support policymaking. cdc will share information publicly on the recommended use of antibody testing as soon as enough data becomes available. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should i test for igg, igm, or total immunoglobulin QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 currently, there is no identified performance advantage of assays whether they test for igg, igm and igg, or total antibody. thus, immunoglobulin class should not determine which assay you choose to use. using an assay that tests for igm antibodies might be able to detect a more recent infection with sars-cov-2, but we do not yet have enough data to confirm this. we need additional data on the immune response to sars-cov-2 before we can make evidence-based recommendations about these different assays. scientists from cdc and elsewhere are investigating how sars-cov-2 antibody responses develop over time. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 specimen handling TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how should the laboratory perform a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 all laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks and determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols. risk assessments and mitigation measures are dependent on the procedures performed, identification of the hazards involved in the process and/or procedures, the competency level of the personnel who perform the procedures, the laboratory equipment and facility, and the resources available. TAG1  TAG1 the risk assessment should identify all potential scenarios of a particular activity that could produce a negative outcome. the risk assessment should prioritize those potential negative outcomes, or risks, based on an evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of each of those identified risks. the risk assessment should determine the most appropriate control measures, and how the system will measure the effectiveness of those control measures. TAG1  TAG1 for additional information, refer to the following: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 specimen types TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 are stool specimens appropriate for sars-cov-2 viral testing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 stool specimens do not have emergency use authorization (eua) approval and thus are not acceptable for sars-cov-2 viral testing. although data are limited, they indicate that stool might not be an appropriate specimen. stool specimens are less sensitive than respiratory specimens, and sars-cov-2 rna is often detected later during covid-19 illness. therefore, testing stool early in illness could potentially lead to false negative sars-cov-2 viral test results. also, even though viral tests have detected sars-cov-2 rna in stool (i.e., a positive test), infectious virus has only been confirmed very rarely, if at all in samples. in other words, a positive sars-cov-2 test does not necessarily mean a patient is currently infected and can infect others.

TAG1  TAG1 the frequently asked questions (faqs) on this page are for a general public or consumer audience. other audiences may want to refer to additional faqs: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: what is coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. cdc has information on  TAG2 covid-19 symptoms TAG2  and caring for yourself and others. covid-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: what is the fda doing to respond to the covid-19 pandemic QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: the fda, along with other federal, state, and local agencies and public health officials across the country and internationally, plays a critical role in protecting public health during the covid-19 pandemic. fda staff are working around the clock to support development of   TAG2 medical countermeasures TAG2  and are providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices for use diagnosing, treating, and preventing this novel virus. the fda continues to monitor the human and animal food supply and take swift action on fraudulent covid-19 products. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: what is an emergency use authorization and how is it being used to respond to covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: in certain types of emergencies, the fda can issue an emergency use authorization, or eua, to provide more timely access to critical medical products that may help during the emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative options. the eua process is different than full fda approval, clearance, or licensing because the eua standard requires significantly less data than otherwise would be required for approval, clearance, or licensing by the fda. this enables the fda to authorize the emergency use of medical products that meet the criteria for issuance within weeks rather than months to years. under the eua authority, the fda evaluates requests for authorization very quickly using the evidence that is available, carefully balancing the risks and benefits of the product as we know them, in addition to evaluating other criteria. euas are in effect until the emergency declaration ends but can be revised or revoked as we evaluate the needs during the emergency, or as products meet the criteria to become approved, cleared, or licensed by the fda. the  TAG2 what is an eua QUESTION  video TAG2  provides a short summary of this information.  TAG1  TAG1 on february 4, 2020, the hhs secretary determined that there is a public health emergency involving covid-19, and subsequently issued declarations justifying the use of euas for medical products to prevent, treat and diagnose covid-19. to date, over 100 euas have been issued to allow emergency access to tests, medical devices, personal protective equipment and therapeutics.  TAG2 see the euas that have been issued for covid-19 TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: how does covid-19 spread QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: covid-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. some people without symptoms may be able to spread the virus. we are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes. the cdc has additional information on  TAG2 how covid-19 spreads TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: how can i prevent covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. cdc recommends  TAG2 everyday preventive actions TAG2  to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. TAG1  TAG1 cdc recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. if soap and water are not available, cdc recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: should i wear a face covering or face mask when i go out in public QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: cdc  TAG2 recommends wearing cloth face coverings TAG2  in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. the purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. read more about  TAG2 types of face masks TAG2  and the fda’s emergency use authorization for  TAG2 non-surgical face masks TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: what treatments are available for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: currently there are no fda-approved medicines specifically for covid-19. however, the fda has granted emergency use authorizations for some medicines to be used for certain patients hospitalized with covid-19. the national institutes of health provides more information about  TAG2 treatment options TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 people with covid-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. people with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. if you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have covid-19. never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: can i prevent or treat covid-19 by using disinfectant sprays, wipes, or liquids on my skin QUESTION  can i inject, inhale, or ingest (swallow) disinfectants to prevent or treat covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: no. disinfectant products such as sprays, wipes, or liquids are only to be used on hard, non-porous surfaces (materials that do not absorb liquids easily) such as floors and countertops.  TAG1  TAG1 disinfectants should not be used on human or animal skin. disinfectants may cause serious skin and eye irritation.  TAG1  TAG1 disinfectants are dangerous for people to inject, inhale, or ingest. if you breathe, inject, or swallow disinfectants you may be seriously hurt or die. if someone near you swallows, injects, or breathes a disinfectant, call poison control or a medical professional immediately.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: are there any fda-approved drugs (medicines) for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: currently there are no fda-approved medicines specifically approved for the treatment or prevention of covid-19. during public health emergencies, the fda may authorize use of unapproved drugs or unapproved uses of approved drugs for life-threatening conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available options and other conditions are met. this is called an emergency use authorization (eua). the fda has issued  TAG2 euas for some medicines TAG2  to be used for certain patients hospitalized with covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 researchers are studying new drugs, and medicines that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for covid-19. the fda created the  TAG2 coronavirus treatment acceleration program (ctap) TAG2  to use every available method to move new treatments to patients. additionally, the fda is working with the  TAG2 national institutes of health TAG2 , drug manufacturers, researchers, and  TAG2 other partners TAG2  to accelerate the development process for covid-19 treatments.  TAG2 fda’s sentinel system TAG2  is being used to monitor the use of drugs, describe the course of illness among hospitalized patients, and evaluate the treatment impact of therapies actively being used under real-world conditions. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q. is remdesivir approved by the fda to treat covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a. no. remdesivir is an investigational antiviral drug. it is not currently fda-approved to treat or prevent any diseases, including covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 because remdesivir may possibly help very sick patients, the fda is allowing this drug to be provided to hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 under an  TAG2 emergency use authorization (eua) issued may 1, 2020 TAG2 . under the eua,  TAG2 health care providers TAG2  and  TAG2 patients TAG2  are provided with information about the risks of remdesivir. however, final data from clinical trials included in an fda application for approval are necessary for us to determine whether the drug is safe and effective in treating covid-19. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q. are there data showing remdesivir might benefit patients with covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a. in vitro (laboratory) testing of remdesivir demonstrated it is active against sars-cov-2 (the virus causing covid-19). preliminary results from a phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir by the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases suggests that patients taking remdesivir experienced faster time to recovery as compared to patients taking a placebo. this trial included a sizeable proportion of patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) at baseline.  based on these findings, the  TAG2 fact sheet for health care providers TAG2  details a 10-day treatment course for patients receiving mechanical ventilation or ecmo.  TAG1  TAG1 preliminary results from a different phase 3 trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease reported that patients receiving a 5-day treatment course achieved similar improvement as those taking a 10-day treatment course; however, importantly, very few patients in this trial were receiving mechanical ventilation or ecmo at baseline. therefore, based on these findings, the fact sheet for health care providers details a 5-day treatment course for patients who are not receiving mechanical ventilation or ecmo. patients who receive a 5-day treatment course but do not demonstrate clinical improvement are eligible to continue to receive remdesivir for an additional 5 days. TAG1  TAG1 the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of covid-19 are being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials. TAG1  TAG1 because remdesivir may possibly help very sick patients, the fda is allowing this drug to be provided to hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 under an  TAG2 emergency use authorization (eua) issued may 1, 2020 TAG2 . under the eua,  TAG2 health care providers TAG2  and  TAG2 patients TAG2  are provided with information about the risks of remdesivir. however, final data from clinical trials included in an fda application are necessary for us to determine whether the drug is safe and effective in treating covid-19. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q. how can remdesivir be obtained for use under the eua QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a. hhs’ office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response (aspr)  TAG2 announced TAG2  the allocation plan for remdesivir. gilead donated vials of the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir to treat hospitalized covid-19 patients with severe disease in areas of the country hardest hit by the pandemic. state health departments will distribute the doses to appropriate hospitals in their states because state and local health departments have the greatest insight into community-level needs in the covid-19 response. healthcare providers interested in administering the donated remdesivir in accordance with the authorized use under the eua should contact their state health department. more information about allocation of remdesivir can be found  TAG2 here TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 outside of the eua, remdesivir remains available through  TAG2 emergency investigational new drug applications (einds) TAG2  for pregnant women and children if they cannot gain access to remdesivir via the eua. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: are chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate approved by the fda to treat covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: no. hydroxychloroquine sulfate and some versions of chloroquine phosphate are fda-approved to treat malaria. hydroxychloroquine sulfate is also fda-approved to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. TAG1  TAG1 on march 28, 2020, the fda issued an  TAG2 emergency use authorization (eua) TAG2  for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to treat adults and adolescents hospitalized with covid-19 for whom a clinical trial was not available or participation was not feasible. based on fda’s continued review of the scientific evidence available, the criteria for an eua for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as outlined in section 564(c)(2) of the fd&amp;c act are no longer met. as a result, the eua for these two drugs was revoked on june 15, 2020. read more about  TAG2 this action TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q. should i take chloroquine phosphate used to treat disease in aquarium fish to prevent or treat covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a. no. products marketed for veterinary use, “for research only,” or otherwise not for human consumption have not been evaluated for safety or effectiveness and  TAG2 should never be used by humans TAG2 . the fda is aware that chloroquine phosphate is marketed to treat disease in aquarium fish, but these products have not been evaluated by the fda to determine if they are safe, effective, properly manufactured, and adequately labeled. the agency continues to work with online marketplaces to remove these items, and many have been removed based on these efforts. patients should not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed health care provider. chloroquine products also should not be given to pets or livestock unless prescribed by a veterinarian.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: no. antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. antibiotics do not prevent or treat covid-19, because covid-19 is caused by a virus, not bacteria. some patients with covid-19 may also develop a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia. in that case, a health care professional may treat the bacterial infection with an antibiotic. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: should i take ivermectin to prevent or treat covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: no. while there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of covid-19. you should not take any medicine to treat or prevent covid-19 unless it has been prescribed to you by your health care provider and acquired from a legitimate source.  TAG1  TAG1 a recently released  TAG2 research article TAG2  described the effect of ivermectin on sars-cov-2 in a laboratory setting. these types of laboratory studies are commonly used at an early stage of drug development. additional testing is needed to determine whether ivermectin might be appropriate to prevent or treat coronavirus or covid-19.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q. how are people tested for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a. in general, for diagnostic tests, samples are collected from a person’s nose and/or throat using swabs or other collection devices by a healthcare provider in a health care setting. a health care professional swabbing the back of the nasal cavity through the nostril is the preferred way to collect a sample to test for covid-19. alternatively, a health care professional may swab the back of your throat or the inside of the front of the nose. certain tests may also allow collection of alternative sample types. additionally, the fda has authorized some tests for use with home sample collection kits that are prescribed by a doctor and allow the patient to collect the sample at home and send it directly to the lab for analysis. learn more about  TAG2 coronavirus testing basics TAG2 .   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: are there any tests that i can purchase to test myself at home for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: no, at this time, the fda has not authorized any covid-19 test to be completely used and processed at home. however, the fda has issued  TAG2 emergency use authorizations (euas) TAG2   for certain covid-19 molecular diagnostic tests to be used with samples collected by a person using a home collection kit that is sent to a laboratory for processing and test reporting. in general, a healthcare provider determines whether a person can use a home collection kit as explained in each test’s eua. TAG1  TAG1 the fda sees the public health value in expanding the availability of covid-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection options, and we are actively working with test developers to expand the use of such options. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: what is the difference between the types of tests available for sars-cov-2 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: there are two different types of tests –  TAG2 diagnostic tests TAG2  and  TAG2 antibody tests TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 a  TAG2 diagnostic test TAG2  can show if you have an active coronavirus infection and should take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. currently there are two types of diagnostic tests –  TAG2 molecular (rt-pcr) TAG2  tests that detect the virus’s genetic material, and  TAG2 antigen TAG2  tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. samples are typically collected with a nasal or throat swab, or saliva collected by spitting into a tube. TAG2  TAG2 an TAG2  antibody test TAG2  looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat, such as a specific virus. antibodies can help fight infections. antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. because of this, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection. at this time, researchers do not know if the presence of antibodies means that you are immune to the coronavirus in the future. while there is a lot of uncertainty with this new virus, it is also possible that, over time, broad use of antibody tests and clinical follow-up will provide the medical community with more information on whether or not, and how long, a person who has recovered from the virus is at lower risk of infection if they are exposed to the virus again. samples are typically blood from a finger stick or blood draw. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: should i purchase personal protective equipment such as facemasks or n95 respirators for me and my family QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: no.  TAG2 surgical masks and n95s TAG2  need to be reserved for use by health care workers, first responders, and other frontline workers whose jobs put them at much greater risk of acquiring covid-19. the cloth face coverings recommended by cdc are not surgical masks or n95 respirators. surgical masks and n95s are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for health care workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by cdc. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: is there a shortage of personal protective equipment (ppe) such as gloves, masks, and n95 respirators or of ventilators QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a:  the fda has been working closely with ppe and ventilator manufacturers to understand their supply capabilities during this pandemic. the agency is also aware of challenges throughout the supply chain that are presently impacting the availability of ppe products and is taking steps to mitigate shortages that health care facilities are already experiencing.  TAG1  TAG1 the fda  TAG2 issued new guidance TAG2  to give ventilator manufacturers and non-medical device manufacturers more flexibility to start making new ventilators and parts. we  TAG2 adjusted our screening of ppe  and medical devices TAG2  at u.s. ports of entry to expedite imports of legitimate products into the u.s. with cdc we  TAG2 took action TAG2  to make more respirators, including certain n95s, available to health care personnel for use in health care settings.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: will there be food shortages QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: in some cases the inventory of certain foods at your grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock. food production and manufacturing generally are widely dispersed throughout the u.s., however; there is a significant shift in where consumers are buying food during the pandemic. while food use in large-scale establishments, such as hotels, restaurants, sports arenas/stadiums and universities suddenly declined, the demand for food at grocery stores increased.   TAG1  TAG1 the fda has issued  TAG2 temporary guidance TAG2  to provide flexibility in packaging and labeling requirements to support food supply chains and get foods to the consumer retail marketplace. the fda is closely monitoring the food supply chain for any shortages in collaboration with industry and our federal and state partners. we are in regular contact with food manufacturers and grocery stores.  TAG2 watch a video TAG2  on food safety and availability during the coronavirus pandemic. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q. why is the fda providing flexibility to food manufacturers, under limited circumstances during the covid-19 public health emergency, to make minor changes in ingredients without reflecting those changes on the package label QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: due to limited shortages of specific ingredients and foods, or unexpected supply chain disruptions in some industries, food manufacturers may need to make small changes to some ingredients during the covid-19 public health emergency. manufacturers may not be able to relabel their products to reflect these minor changes on the food label without slowing down the processing or distribution of the food. TAG1  TAG1 to avoid slowing down food processing or distribution during the coronavirus pandemic, the fda issued a guidance titled &quot; TAG2 temporary policy regarding certain food labeling requirements during the covid-19 public health emergency: minor formulation changes and vending machines TAG2 .&quot;  the temporary policy provides food manufacturers with flexibility to make minor formulation changes in certain, limited circumstances without making conforming label changes on packages as long as any substitutions or omissions of ingredients do not pose a health or safety issue (such as allergens), and do not cause significant changes in the finished product. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q. what do i need to know about the temporary policy for food labeling of minor ingredient changes during the covid-19 public health emergency if i have food allergies QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a. although the temporary policy allows some flexibility, the eight major food allergens under the  TAG2 food allergen labeling and consumer protection act (falcpa) of 2004 TAG2  cannot be substituted for labeled ingredients by manufacturers without a corresponding label change. while the temporary policy does not list all ingredients known to cause sensitivities in some people, manufacturers should avoid substituting ingredients with major food allergens or with ingredients recognized as priority allergens (such as sesame, celery, lupin, buckwheat, molluscan shellfish, and mustard) in other parts of the world without a label change. these flexibilities are intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the covid-19 public health emergency in the united states. however, when this public health emergency is over, extensions may be needed if the food and agriculture sectors need additional time to bring supply chains back into regular order. for more information please see more  TAG2 questions and answers on fda’s temporary policy on food labeling changes during the covid-19 pandemic TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: will there be animal food shortages QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: there are no nationwide shortages of animal food, although in some cases the inventory of certain foods at your grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock. animal food production and manufacturing are widely dispersed throughout the united states and no widespread disruptions have been reported in the supply chain.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: can i get covid-19 from a food worker handling my food QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of covid-19. however, the virus that causes covid-19 is spreading from person-to-person in some communities in the u.s. the cdc recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.  TAG1  TAG1 anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow  TAG2 safe food handling procedures TAG2 , such as washing hands and surfaces often. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: should food workers who are ill stay home QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: cdc recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4° f [37.8° c] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants). employees should notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick. we recommend that businesses review  TAG2 cdc’s interim guidance for businesses and employers TAG2  for planning and responding to coronavirus disease.  also see the fda’s  TAG2 retail food protection: employee health and personal hygiene handbook TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: should food facilities (grocery stores, manufacturing facilities, restaurants, etc.) perform any special cleaning or sanitation procedures for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: cdc recommends routine cleaning of all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, countertops, and doorknobs. use the cleaning agents that are usually used in these areas and follow the directions on the label. cdc does not recommend any additional disinfection beyond routine cleaning at this time.  TAG1  TAG1 view the current  TAG2 list of products that meet epa’s criteria for use against sars-cov-2 TAG2 , the cause of covid-19.   TAG1  TAG1 restaurants and retail food establishments are regulated at the state and local level. state, local, and tribal regulators use the  TAG2 food code TAG2  published by the fda to develop or update their own food safety rules. generally, fda-regulated food manufacturers are required to maintain clean facilities, including, as appropriate, clean and sanitized food contact surfaces, and to have food safety plans in place.   food safety plans include a hazards analysis and risk-based preventive controls and include procedures for maintaining clean and sanitized facilities and food contact surfaces. see:  TAG2 fsma final rule for preventive controls for human food TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: can i give my pet covid-19 QUESTION  can i get covid-19 from my pet or other animals QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: there is a very small number of pets around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes covid-19 after having contact with a person with covid-19. there is currently no evidence that animals are a source of covid-19 infection in the united states.  TAG1  TAG1 until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from a potential infection. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 do not let pets interact with people outside the household. TAG2  TAG2 keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other people. TAG2  TAG2 walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people. TAG2  TAG2 avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people gather.

TAG1  TAG1 certain private, state, and university veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, for use in dogs and cats. the fda is also aware of at least two veterinary tests for covid-19 in pets developed by commercial laboratories initially for internal surveillance, but the agency has not evaluated the validity of these tests. the tests are not currently available for routine testing. the decision to test pets should be made collaboratively between local, state, or federal public and animal health officials. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: should i get my pet tested for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: routine testing of pets for covid-19 is not recommended at this time. there is currently no evidence that animals are a source of covid-19 infection in the united states. based on the limited information available to date, the risk of pets spreading the virus is considered to be low. if your pet is sick, consult your veterinarian.  TAG1  TAG1 animal testing is  TAG2 reserved for situations when TAG2  the results may affect the treatment or management of people and animals. if your veterinarian thinks your pet is a candidate for testing, they will consult the state veterinarian and public health officials. do not contact your state veterinarians directly: they do not have the client/patient-veterinarian relationship that would allow them to fully understand the situation and they are also actively involved in other animal disease-related emergencies as well as response to covid-19. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: what animal species can get covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: we currently don’t fully understand how covid-19 affects different animal species. we are aware of a very small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes covid-19 after close contact with people with covid-19.  TAG1  TAG1 on april 22, 2020, the united states department of agriculture (usda) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) announced the first confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 (the virus that causes covid-19) infection in two pet cats. these are the first pets in the united states to test positive for sars-cov-2. the cats lived in two separate areas of new york state. both had mild respiratory illness and are expected to make a full recovery. sars-cov-2 infections have been reported in very few animals worldwide, mostly in those that had close contact with a person with covid-19.  TAG1  TAG1 a tiger at a zoo in new york has also tested positive for the virus; it was the first confirmed case of covid-19 infection in an animal in the united states.  TAG1  TAG1 recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. data from one study suggest that dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. these findings were based upon a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people. TAG1  TAG1 for any animal that tests positive for sars-cov-2 at a private or state laboratory, usda's national veterinary services laboratories performs additional testing to confirm the infection and  TAG2 posts results of positive animals on its website TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: since domestic cats can get infected with the virus that causes covid-19, should i worry about my cat QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: we are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. the fda is aware of a very small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes covid-19. the majority of these cases were linked to close contact with people who tested positive for covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 at this time, there is no evidence that pets, including cats and dogs, play a role in spreading covid-19 to people. the virus that causes covid-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. TAG1  TAG1 people sick with covid-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. if you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: why are animals being tested when many people can’t get tested QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: the fda, usda and cdc recommend that any testing of animals should be conducted using kits not required when testing people. usda’s national veterinary services laboratories (nvsl) and the laboratories of the national animal health laboratory network (nahln) use tests developed for animal testing that are not used for testing in people. this avoids placing additional stresses on human testing resources while also recognizing the potential importance of animal testing to supporting public health.  TAG1  TAG1 although animal and human tests are generally similar, this type of testing has to be adjusted in each species and for each sample type (blood, feces, nasal swab). human and animal tests are not intended to be interchangeable. some testing performed on animals is based on the published tests used in people, but animal testing is not likely to reduce the availability of tests for people if labs follow recommendations from the fda, usda, and cdc that animal testing be conducted using tests developed for animals. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: can pets carry the virus that causes covid-19 on their skin or fur QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes covid-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. TAG1  TAG1 however, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice  TAG2 healthy habits TAG2  around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them and especially after cleaning up their waste. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: are there any approved products that can prevent or treat covid-19 in animals QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: no. under the federal food, drug, and cosmetic (fd&amp;c) act, “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals” are drugs. the fda has not approved any drugs for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of covid-19 in animals. the u.s. department of agriculture’s (usda) animal and plant health inspection service (aphis)  TAG2 center for veterinary biologics (cvb) TAG2  regulates veterinary biologics, including vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other products of biological origin. similarly, aphis cvb has not licensed any products to treat or prevent covid-19 in animals. TAG1  TAG1 the fda has taken action against unapproved products claiming to prevent or cure covid-19. the public can help safeguard human and animal health by reporting any products claiming to do so to  TAG2 fda-covid-19-fraudulent-products@fda.hhs.gov TAG2  or 1-888-info-fda (1-888-463-6332). TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: is it true that animals, like dogs, cats, and cattle, get their own different types of coronavirus QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: yes. coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. some coronaviruses like covid-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. for example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. this vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent covid-19 in cattle or other species, including humans. TAG1  TAG1 dogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” while this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans. TAG1  TAG1 most strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. however, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (fip), a disease that is almost always fatal. TAG1  TAG1 other species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans. more information is available in the american veterinary medical association’s  TAG2 fact sheet about coronaviruses in domestic species TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: if my pet previously had a species-specific coronavirus, does that make them more or less likely to get covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: there are no data to suggest that current or previous infection with another strain of coronavirus would make your pet more or less likely to get covid-19. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: if my pet has been vaccinated for species-specific coronavirus, does that make them more or less likely to get covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: species-specific coronavirus vaccines are unlikely to work against this type of coronavirus because it is a new virus that is different from the species-specific strains of coronavirus targeted by the vaccine. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: my pet has health problems and goes to the vet regularly for treatment. should i be doing anything different to manage their health during the covid-19 outbreak QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: while you should not avoid necessary visits to your veterinarian due to the covid-19 outbreak, you should exercise reasonable caution just like you would if you were going to any other public place. if you are concerned about your own health or that of your pet when going to the veterinarian, contact their office in advance to discuss any recommended precautions. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: is it safe to adopt pets from a shelter or rescue QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: there is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter or rescue pets, in the united states, might be a source of covid-19. the virus that causes covid-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: are there going to be any animal drug shortages due to the covid-19 outbreak QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a: the fda has been and is continuing to closely monitor how the covid-19 outbreak may impact the animal medical product supply chain. TAG1  TAG1 we have been reaching out to manufacturers as part of our approach to identifying potential disruptions or shortages. we will use all available tools to react swiftly to help mitigate the impact if a potential disruption or shortage is identified.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 q:  what is the source of the virus QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a: coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats and bats.  early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak in china had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.  later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside china, including the united states. TAG1  TAG1 q. what does it mean that covid-19 is a global pandemic QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a: a pandemic is a global outbreak of disease.  pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people.  because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide. the virus that causes covid-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person.  cases have been detected in most countries worldwide, including the united states, which has recorded cases in all 50 states. TAG1  TAG1  q: what are the symptoms of covid-2019 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a: people who are infected with covid-19 have developed mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and potentially respiratory distress 2-14 days after exposure. call your health care provider for medical advice if you think you have been exposed to covid-19 and develop a fever and symptoms, such as cough or difficulty breathing. TAG1  TAG1 q: how does covid-19 spread QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a: covid-19 has been shown to spread between people. someone who is actively sick with covid-19 can spread the illness to others, so cdc recommends these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on the severity of their illness) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. human coronaviruses typically spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. how long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.  TAG1  TAG1 	current  TAG2 cdc guidance for when it is ok to release someone from isolation TAG2  is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications for at least 72 hours. TAG2  TAG2 the patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough. TAG2  TAG2 it has been at least 10 days since the onset of the patient’s illness. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 this recommendation is to help prevent most, but may not prevent all, instances of secondary spread.  according to cdc, the risk of transmission after recovery is likely very substantially less than that during illness. TAG1  TAG1 someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others. TAG1  TAG1 q: how is covid-19 diagnosed QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a: there are many tests being used to diagnose covid-19 that the u.s. food &amp; drug administration (fda) has authorized for use during the current emergency. all of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs. some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes. other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes several days. TAG1  TAG1 q: can someone spread the virus without being sick QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a: people are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).  some spread might be possible before people show symptoms. there have been reports of this occurring with covid-19, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. TAG1  TAG1 q: will warm weather stop the outbreak of covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 	a: it is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of covid-19.  some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  there is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity and other features associated with covid-19 and investigations are ongoing. TAG1  TAG1 q: is the stay at home mandate over QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 yes.  however, when outside your residence you must always and as reasonably possible maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people who do not live with you.  keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools to avoiding being exposed to the virus.  for more information about gov. jb pritzker’s executive order restoring illinois – protecting our communities visit  TAG2 http://dph.illinois.gov/restore/restore-faqs TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 q: can more than 10 people gather QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a: yes.  gatherings of 50 people are fewer are now allowed. because in-person contact presents the greatest risk of covid-19 transmission.  illinoisans are encouraged to continue limiting in-person contact with others and to expand their social contact cautiously.

TAG1  TAG1 p: ¿cómo se propaga el covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 r:  el covid-19 ha demostrado propagarse entre personas.  la persona que tiene la enfermedad activa (muestra síntomas) puede transmitir la enfermedad a otras personas. por eso, los cdc recomiendan que estos pacientes sean aislados en el hospital o en casa (dependiendo de la gravedad de su enfermedad) hasta que estén mejor y ya no representen un riesgo de infección para los demás. TAG1  TAG1 el coronavirus en ser humanos  TAG2 típicamente TAG2  se propaga a través de las gotitas respiratorias que se producen cuando una persona infectada tose o estornuda. el tiempo que uno tiene la enfermedad activa (muestra síntomas) puede variar así que la decisión de cuándo se le puede permitir salir del aislamiento deberá tomarse según cada caso en particular y en consulta con médicos, expertos en la prevención y el control de infecciones, y funcionarios de salud pública. esta decisión implicará tener en cuenta las características específicas de cada situación, lo cual incluye la gravedad de la enfermedad, sus señales de enfermedad y síntomas, y los resultados de las pruebas de laboratorio del paciente.

TAG1  TAG1 note: if you have questions related to covid-19 that aren't addressed here or you're looking for medical guidance (e.g., whether you should be tested, how to go about getting tested, etc.), contact your physician and/or health department. minnesota residents can reach the minnesota department of health's covid-19 hotline at (651) 201-3920.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 covid-19 frequently asked questions  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 1. what is the covid-19 virus QUESTION  TAG2 the pathogen that causes covid-19 is a respiratory virus that was first identified in wuhan, china, in late 2019. the virus is spreading worldwide, causing illness in at least 187 countries (as of may 8), including the united states. the organism is a member of a family of viruses that also cause the common cold and other respiratory illnesses, including sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which emerged in 2002, and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome), which first appeared in 2012. coronaviruses get their name from their crown-like appearance—&quot;corona&quot; in latin refers to a crown or garland. many of the early covid-19 infections were identified in people who had a connection to a seafood market that also housed live animals, suggesting that the virus originated in animals. because the virus is so new, information about it is limited. the virus is also called sars-cov-2.  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 2. what are the symptoms of covid-19, and how severe is the illness QUESTION  TAG2 symptoms can include cough, fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, and shortness of breath. they may range from mild to severe. in severe cases, pneumonia and other complications can develop and can sometimes lead to death, especially in older adults and those with underlying health conditions. the proportion of severe cases is not yet clear and could vary among countries depending on population demographics and the healthcare infrastructure. data from china, the diamond princess cruise ship, and other affected countries suggest that the case-fatality rate thus far has been between about 1% and 4%. researchers at imperial college london estimate the overall case-fatality ratio at 1%. experts say it is too early to estimate case-fatality rates with confidence, because there is much uncertainty about the true numbers of cases and deaths. studies also suggest that a substantial proportion of covid-19 cases show no symptoms of infection (asymptomatic infections). further research is needed to confidently determine more accurate case-fatality rates and the true prevalence of asymptomatic infections. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1 3.  TAG2 how is the virus transmitted QUESTION  does it spread from person to person QUESTION  TAG2 it appears that the virus can spread among people in close contact, meaning less than 6 feet apart, according to the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). the virus is thought to be carried by droplets produced when sick people cough or sneeze, as occurs with influenza and other respiratory pathogens. the droplets may reach other people’s noses, mouths, or eyes, and they may possibly be inhaled as well. additionally, studies have suggested that aerosolization of the virus is likely, leading experts to believe that transmission could occur through normal breathing practices. unlike droplets containing viruses, which fall to the ground shortly after they are generated, aerosolized viruses can remain suspended in the air for varying lengths of time. it is not yet known whether you can contract the virus by touching a contaminated object (i.e., fomite) and then touching your nose, mouth, or eyes. more research is needed to determine the role that aerosols and fomites play in transmission of covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 with most respiratory viruses, people are most likely to pass the virus to others when they are sickest, but with covid-19, transmission has occurred from people who were infected but not showing symptoms, that is, during the incubation period, as well as in asymptomatic people. in early may chinese researchers reported detecting covid-19 viral material (not infectious virus) in the semen of patients and recovered men in a small study, but it did not indicate the virus can be transmitted sexually. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 4. how easily does the virus spread QUESTION  TAG2 just how easily the virus can spread is not yet clear. studies based on data from china and the diamond princess cruise ship have suggested that the virus has a basic reproductive value between 2 and 2.5, meaning that each case-patient, on average, spreads the virus to about two other people. theoretically, this would make the virus more contagious than the 1918 influenza virus, which had a basic reproductive value of 1.8. these results are preliminary and vary depending on factors such as public health measures like quarantine, which can influence the spread of a disease. research on this question is ongoing. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 5. should i avoid contact with certain types of animals QUESTION  TAG2 coronaviruses circulate in many kinds of animals, such as camels, cattle, cats, and bats, and in rare cases they can jump to people. for example, the original sars virus in 2002 and 2003 spread from civet cats to humans in china. the covid-19 virus seems to have emerged from an animal source, as noted above, but it is now spreading from person to person. the cdc has reported that a limited number of animals have tested positive for covid-19. the first us case involved a tiger with respiratory illness at a new york city zoo. additionally, a small number of pets, such as dogs and cats, have tested positive for covid-19. not all of the positive animals showed signs of illness. in each of these cases, it appears that an infected person transmitted the virus to the animal. while information is still being obtained in these cases, it does not appear that animals are playing a significant role in the transmission of covid-19. however, out of an abundance of caution, the cdc recommends avoiding close contact with pets, whenever possible, if an owner is sick with covid-19. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 6. how do you test a person for infection QUESTION  TAG2 there are two predominant tests being used to detect cases of covid-19. the first test, known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), looks for specific genetic material unique to the virus. rt-pcr tests are often conducted on samples of respiratory secretions, such as nasal or oral swabs. if genetic material from the virus is present at detectable levels in the sample, rt-pcr identifies it and a positive result is generated, signaling that the individual is currently infected with covid-19. if an individual is not infected, viral material won’t be present and the test will generate a negative result. TAG1  TAG1 the second type of test being used to detect cases of covid-19 is serology. serology tests identify and measure the presence of antibodies for the virus in blood. antibodies are generated by the immune system to fight off an infection and can continue to circulate in the bloodstream after an individual is recovered. detecting antibodies specific to covid-19 in the blood indicates that an individual was previously infected with the disease. factors such as when an individual was infected and the timing of serology testing make it less successful at detecting current infections than rt-pcr, since antibody levels can remain too low for detection in the early days of an infection while the immune system is still ramping up. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 7. how can i reduce my exposure QUESTION  TAG2 simple, everyday steps for preventing respiratory infections are the best way to protect yourself against this virus: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands TAG2  TAG2 avoid contact with people who are sick TAG2  TAG2 stay home if you are sick TAG2  TAG2 to keep from spreading viruses to others, cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or a flexed elbow, and then throw the tissue in the trash TAG2  TAG2 wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose; if soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer TAG2  TAG2 clean and disinfect often-touched surfaces with a household cleaning spray or wipe TAG2  TAG2 don’t consume raw or undercooked animal products TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 see question 10 below for advice about the use of surgical masks (face masks). TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 8. is there a treatment for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2 because covid-19 is a novel virus, potential treatments for infection are being researched and evaluated. current treatment for covid-19 patients is most often in the form of supportive care to relieve symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, and fever. antibiotics are not effective, because they work only against bacterial infections, not viruses. the food and drug administration (fda) has issued emergency use authorization for the antiviral drug remdesivir after results from a clinical trial suggested that it accelerates recovery times in patients with severe covid-19 infections. other treatments for covid-19 could become available if studies prove they are safe and effective. if you think you have been exposed to or infected with the covid-19 virus, you should immediately consult with your healthcare provider and/or health department, since early treatment might reduce the risk of severe illness. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 9. how long can the virus persist in the environment QUESTION  TAG2 studies assessing environmental persistence of the virus have found that it can remain on surfaces from several hours to several days depending on the material and conditions. one study assessing the persistence of the virus in the environment has suggested that it can remain viable for up to 72 hours on plastics, 48 hours on stainless steel, 24 hours on cardboard, and 4 hours on copper. the virus was also detectable in the air for 3 hours. it is important to note that, although the virus remained detectable for these reported durations during the study, the overall amount of viral material dropped significantly over time upon entry into the environment. thus, despite remaining detectable, it is unknown whether the virus would be infectious for the entirety of these reported durations. the covid-19 virus is susceptible to common and standard disinfectants.  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 10. should the general public be using surgical masks (face masks) or n95 respirators QUESTION  TAG2 for someone infected with a respiratory virus, wearing a mask can help prevent spreading the virus to others, but for healthy people, wearing a mask has limited effectiveness. in general, the cdc and world health organization (who) do not recommend that healthy people wear a surgical mask to protect themselves from respiratory viruses, including this novel coronavirus. authorities do recommend, however, that people with symptoms of possible covid-19 wear a face mask to protect others. with evidence of asymptomatic infections, the cdc has offered guidance recommending that individuals wear cloth masks in settings where physical distancing is difficult and/or in areas with high levels of community-based transmission. cloth masks are not surgical masks or n95 respirators, which should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders, according to cdc guidelines. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 11. when can we expect a vaccine QUESTION  TAG2 a number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies are currently working on vaccines for this virus, but it is likely to take many months to make one available. in february, the head of the who estimated it may take 18 months to produce a vaccine, but that would not include licensing and distribution. as covid-19 vaccine candidates are developed, rigorous clinical testing is needed to prove the vaccine is safe and effective. such clinical testing takes time, and additional work is needed after completion of the testing before a vaccine can be produced in quantity.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 on this page: TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 how to avoid getting sick TAG1  TAG1 how does covid‑19 spread QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 covid-19 spreads mainly from person to person, especially between close contacts (people within about 6 feet of each other). when an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes, droplets from their mouth can spread through the air and land in the mouths or noses of nearby people. covid‑19 can also spread by a person touching a surface or object that has virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. sick people are the most contagious but people who don’t have symptoms can also spread the virus. TAG1  TAG1 how can i help protect myself QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there is currently no vaccine to prevent covid-19. the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed. take the following precautions to avoid exposure: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 avoid close contact with people who are sick. TAG2  TAG2 wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. if soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. TAG2  TAG2 clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. TAG2  TAG2 avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. TAG2  TAG2 cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. TAG2  TAG2 stay home when you are sick. TAG2  TAG2 when you must go out, practice social distancing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what is social distancing, and does it help QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 social distancing involves staying at least 6 feet away from other people to avoid catching or spreading a virus. it's a fancy term for avoiding crowds and minimizing physical contact. the safest thing to do during an outbreak is stay home as much as possible and minimize close contact with others. when you must go out, such as to shop for groceries, stay at least 6 feet away from others. TAG1  TAG1 what should i do if i had close contact with someone who has covid‑19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 if you have had close contact with someone who has covid-19, monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days after the last day you were exposed to protect your health and those around you. the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. other symptoms may include, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, chills, headache, runny nose, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. if you are 65 or older or have a medical condition (such as heart, lung, or liver disease, diabetes or cancer), or are on kidney dialysis, and you have been exposed to someone who has covid-19—call your doctor. TAG1  TAG1 how to avoid infecting others TAG1  TAG1 does staying home really help prevent the spread of covid-19 QUESTION   TAG1  TAG1 by staying home and only going out into public for essential activities, such as grocery shopping or picking up medications, you will minimize your exposure to covid-19, and fewer exposed people means fewer cases of the disease. at this time, slowing the rate of infection, or flattening the curve, remains very important. flattening the curve means fewer people are sick all at the same time. this helps our hospitals from becoming overrun and unable to treat everyone who needs care.   TAG1  TAG1 should i wear a cloth face covering in public QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends members of the general public wear a cloth face covering in light of new data about how covid-19 spreads. the virus is thought to be spread mainly from person to person when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. TAG1  TAG1 a cloth face covering is  TAG2  TAG2 not TAG2  TAG2  intended to protect the person who is wearing it. but, wearing a cloth face covering  TAG2  TAG2 may TAG2  TAG2  prevent the person wearing it from spreading covid-19 to the people around them. sometimes infected people don’t have symptoms. so even if you don’t feel sick, wearing a cloth face covering may help prevent you from spreading covid-19 to those around you. TAG1  TAG1 to be effective, the cloth face covering should cover your nose and your mouth. TAG1  TAG1 when should i wear a cloth face covering QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 wear a cloth face covering whenever you are out in the community, such as when getting groceries, medication or medical care. these face coverings help when you can’t avoid being in the same space as others.  TAG1  TAG1 wearing a cloth face covering does  TAG2  TAG2 not TAG2  TAG2  mean you don’t need to stay away from others. social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet from others, is still necessary to keep you and others safe. TAG1  TAG1 do i still need to stay at least 6 feet away from people if wearing a cloth face covering QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 yes. wearing a cloth face covering is just a part of your overall protection plan to keep you and others from spreading and getting covid-19. that plan includes: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet away from other people TAG2  TAG2 frequent hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds TAG2  TAG2 not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands TAG2  TAG2 avoiding close contact with people who are sick TAG2  TAG2 staying home when you are sick TAG2  TAG2 covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue TAG2  TAG2 disinfecting high-touch surfaces often, such as buttons, handles, and knobs TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 wearing cloth face coverings is an  TAG2 additional TAG2  public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of covid-19, not the only measure. TAG1  TAG1 why is the cdc recommending wearing cloth face coverings instead of medical-grade facemasks QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 surgical masks and n95 respirators are in short supply. so, do your part to protect our healthcare workers. save medical-grade equipment for healthcare workers and first responders. wear a cloth face covering, not a medical-grade mask. TAG1  TAG1 are there people who shouldn’t wear a mask QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 yes. children under 2 years old should not wear cloth face coverings. also, anyone who has trouble breathing or who is unconscious, incapacitated or unable to remove the cloth face covering without help should not wear one. TAG1  TAG1 is there a correct way to put on, adjust or remove a cloth face covering QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 yes. don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth when you put on, adjust or remove your cloth face covering. always wash your hands immediately after putting on, adjusting or removing your cloth face covering, because you can pick up the virus on your hands by touching it. TAG1  TAG1 high-risk populations TAG1  TAG1 who’s at high risk for serious illness from covid‑19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 while everyone is at risk for getting covid-19, some people are at higher risk for getting very sick from the virus. TAG1  TAG1 people 65 years old and older have an increased risk of developing serious illness if they get sick with covid-19. strong evidence also suggests that people of any age with certain medical conditions have an increased risk of getting very sick from covid-19. those conditions are chronic kidney disease, copd (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), obesity, serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, type 2 diabetes, and a weakened immune system from an organ transplant. for the most up-to-date information, see the  TAG2 people who need to take extra precautions TAG2  section of the cdc website. the cdc is learning more about covid-19 every day and will update this section of their website as more information becomes available. TAG1  TAG1 if you are in a high-risk category, call your doctor as soon as you get sick and get their advice before you go anywhere. if you can’t breathe or have severe chest pain, call 911 and/or immediately go to the er. TAG1  TAG1 some people who become infected may not show symptoms, yet they can still spread the virus to others. therefore, everyone should take precautions to avoid becoming infected and infecting others.

TAG1  TAG1 can a person test negative and later test positive for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 test results reflect the state of illness at the time when you are tested. someone can test negative one day, then get exposed, and test positive on a later day. if a person is in the early stages of infection, it is possible the test will not detect the virus and come back negative. TAG1  TAG1 caring for yourself or someone else at home TAG1  TAG1 how do i treat covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there is no cure for covid 19 yet. there is also no vaccine available yet. the best you can do is treat symptoms. only the very sick will need hospitalization.

TAG2  TAG2 your symptoms have significantly improved, and you no longer have a productive cough. TAG2  TAG2 it has been at least 10 days since your symptoms first appeared. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 do home remedies help QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 home remedies and therapies are not proven to help alleviate symptoms nor ensure you won't get it. that's why it is important to focus on prevention: always practice good hygiene and stay away from sick people. eating healthy, regular physical exercise, good sleep, and lowering stress levels are great ways to keep your immune system healthy. TAG1  TAG1 pregnant women &amp; children TAG1  TAG1 are pregnant women at greater risk from covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 according to the cdc, we do not currently know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from covid-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. with viruses from the same family as covid-19, and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, pregnant women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness. it is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses. TAG1  TAG1 how can pregnant women protect themselves QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid covid-19 infection, including: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 avoid close contact with people who are sick. TAG2  TAG2 wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. if soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. TAG2  TAG2 clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. TAG2  TAG2 avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. TAG2  TAG2 cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. TAG2  TAG2 stay home when you are sick. TAG2  TAG2 when you must go out, practice social distancing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 can covid-19 be passed from mother to child QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 according to the cdc, it is unlikely that covid-19 can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy. however, it is possible for a baby to become infected after birth. for more information about covid-19 and pregnancy, visit the  TAG2 cdc’s pregnancy and breastfeeding webpage TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1 do face masks protect against covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 face masks can help prevent an infected individual from spreading the virus. TAG1  TAG1 you can make your own face mask at home. cdc recommends using breathable cloth such as 100 percent cotton, with two layers of fabric for optimal filtering. when held up to a bright light, the fabric should not let a lot of light shine through. face coverings should: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face TAG2  TAG2 be secured with ties or ear loops TAG2  TAG2 allow for breathing without restriction TAG2  TAG2 be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 face masks are not recommended for children less than age two years or by individuals who have trouble breathing or who cannot easily remove them. TAG1  TAG1 n-95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare professionals and other first responders. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 remember: face masks are not a substitute for other preventive measures TAG2 —continue to wash your hands properly, avoid touching your face, and maintain social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart from others) in conjunction with wearing face masks in public spaces. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long does the covid-19 virus live on surfaces QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 initial reports indicate that the virus can persist for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces. it is important to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces each day. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what are the best cleaners to remove germs QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 it is important to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces on a regular basis. detergent or soap and water can be used to clean surfaces. to disinfect, use diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, or common household disinfectants, which are effective in killing this virus and can be used safely. TAG1  TAG1 hand hygiene is most important because hands are an important means of transmission for this virus. there are many things that we cannot control but we can wash hands and keep them away from our faces. TAG1  TAG1 testing TAG1  TAG1 what tests are available to detect covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there are currently three types of covid-19 tests authorized by the us food and drug administration (fda): TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 molecular tests TAG2  are used to detect the genetic material of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. molecular tests are fairly accurate and can be used to diagnose the disease. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 antigen tests  TAG2 are a new category of tests that can quickly detect fragments of the virus from nasal swabs. antigen tests can provide results in minutes, but they are not as sensitive as molecular tests. positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but negative results may need to be confirmed with a molecular test. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 antibody (or serology) tests TAG2  detect the body’s immune response to covid-19 by looking for antibodies in the blood to help determine prior exposure. when the body is fighting an infection or has fought an infection, antibodies can be found in the blood. these tests do not detect the actual virus but are used to identify people who have been infected with the virus in the past. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 fda has authorized more than 180 tests for emergency use including more than 150 molecular tests, 30 antibody tests, and 2 antigen tests. accuracy varies among all of the tests. the resulting uncertainty can complicate public health decisions. TAG1  TAG1 some antibody tests have a high potential for false-negative and false-positive results. they may not be able to detect antibodies in the blood of someone who is newly infected, and they may not be able to distinguish sars-cov-2 from other coronaviruses. the presence of antibodies may indicate immunity from covid-19, but that has not yet been conclusively proven; nor do scientists know the duration of protection. although serologic tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune, these tests can help determine the proportion of a population previously infected with sars-cov-2 and provide information about populations that may be immune and potentially protected. TAG1  TAG1 treatment TAG1  TAG1 is there treatment available for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 currently, there is no proven drug for treating patients with covid-19. the disease is still new, and scientists are still learning about the virus that causes it. drugs to treat covid-19 may be given to patients as part of a clinical trial, so that scientists can determine the effectiveness of the treatments. many such studies are underway in the united states and other countries. TAG1  TAG1 the national institutes of health (nih) has developed new treatment guidelines for covid-19 ( TAG2 covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov TAG2 ). the guidelines, which will be updated as experts learn more about the disease, include recommendations on antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, as well as other treatments such as convalescent plasma and immune globulins. talk to your healthcare professional about treatments that may be available for you. TAG1  TAG1 stop the spread TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is social distancing QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 deliberately increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illness. staying at least 6 feet away from other people lessens your chances of catching or spreading covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 is it safe to go to the dentist—or any other routine healthcare provider QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 in many states, the current recommendation is still to postpone elective dental procedures and elective surgeries, to avoid putting an extra strain on the us healthcare system. TAG1  TAG1 many routine medical visits can be provided virtually via telemedicine. other services, such as routine vaccinations, may be available in pharmacies or in clinics that have special immunization office hours or separate waiting rooms. it is important to make sure that you and your family members are up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations. TAG1  TAG1 if you have a specific issue that needs attention, talk with a healthcare professional who can provide advice. in an emergency, call 911. TAG1  TAG1 is it dangerous to be outdoors QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 going out for a walk is good exercise and may be psychologically beneficial. but, wear a face covering and maintain at least a 6-foot distance between others. individuals who have a chronic health condition such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes, as well as older adults are at greater risk for complications from covid-19 and should be extra careful around others—either indoors or outdoors. TAG1  TAG1 how do outbreaks typically end QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 state and local authorities are carefully tracking the occurrence of covid-19 in each community. once the number of cases starts to decline, federal, state, and local authorities consider how to reduce social distancing requirements gradually. individuals should follow the advice of local public health authorities and continue healthy habits like washing hands and avoiding touching your face. TAG1  TAG1 there are several ways that an outbreak can come to an end. the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak was controlled through close coordination between public health officials and clinicians who were able to diagnose cases, isolate infected patients, trace their contacts, and implement strong infection control policies. an outbreak also can also end once the virus has infected most of the people who are susceptible to it, because it has fewer targets, as was the case with the zika virus outbreaks in recent years. if covid-19 behaves like other respiratory viruses, including flu, it could become part of the annual cold and flu respiratory season.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: what are the treatments QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there are no specific treatments for illnesses caused by human coronaviruses at this time. there is ongoing medical research regarding treatment of sars-cov-2. although most people will recover on their own, you can do some things to help relieve your symptoms, including: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 take medications to relieve pain and fever TAG2  TAG2 use a room humidifier or take a hot shower to help ease a sore throat and cough TAG2  TAG2 if you are mildly sick, drink plenty of fluids, stay home, and get plenty of rest TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 q: how is covid-19 transmitted QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: covid-19 illness is spread mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets (mucous from the nose and throat) when a person who has covid-19 illness coughs or sneezes and another person comes into contact with the infectious droplets. this is how the flu and many other respiratory illnesses spread. respiratory droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be breathed into the lungs. spread of the virus is more likely when people are at a close distance, such as within about 6 feet. some information has been reported that the virus that causes covid-19 is in the fecal matter (bowel movements) of infected patients. while cdc does not report this as a clearly understood way the virus is transmitted, it remains important to wash your hands after using the restroom. in some environments, the virus that causes covid-19 can survive on surfaces, so regular sanitation of shared surfaces is important. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: can a person spread the infection if they don’t feel sick QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: people are thought to be most contagious (able to spread the virus) when they are symptomatic (the sickest). that is why cdc recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. more recently, the virus has also been found in persons who do not have symptoms. this is why social distancing, good respiratory hygiene, including good hand washing, and staying at home unless you have to go out for food, supplies, or essential work, are important ways to reduce the spread of this virus. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: how long can a person spread covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: at this time, health officials do not know when someone with covid-19 becomes contagious. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) is working with public health agencies and scientists to learn more about covid-19. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: if you've already had covid-19, can you get it again QUESTION  do you still need to wear a mask and practice social distancing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: due to the sarscov 2 being a novel (new) virus, there is not clear scientific evidence concerning the body's ability to develop long term immunity. so, even if a person has had covid 19 and has recovered, the person should still maintain social distancing, follow good hand washing or hand sanitizing practices, and wear a cloth face covering when in public. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: how can i be more prepared for covid-19 QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: have an adequate supply of nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines. check your regular prescription drugs to make sure you have an adequate supply; refill your prescriptions if needed. have a thermometer, tissues and hand sanitizer in case you become ill and must stay at home to recover. talk with family members and loved ones about how they would be cared for if they got sick and what will be needed to care for them at home. have a two-week supply of water and food available at home. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: should i wear a face mask when i go out in public QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: n95 and surgical masks should be used by healthcare workers and first responders, as they are the persons who need this high level of protection in their work.  TAG2 the cdc recommends the use of cloth face coverings in community settings TAG2  (for example, grocery stores and pharmacies) where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. TAG1  TAG1 there continues to be more information that people who are infected can spread the virus before they develop symptoms or when they do not have symptoms. wearing a cloth face covering may help prevent the spread of the virus by people are infected and do not know it.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: what if i test positive for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: any person who has tested positive for covid-19—other than institutionalized persons—shall be quarantined to their place of residence for a period of 14 days, or other period of time as directed by the state health officer, or his designee, after receiving positive test results. any person quarantined pursuant to this provision shall not leave their place of residence for any reason other than to seek necessary medical treatment. any person requiring assistance while under quarantine may contact  TAG2 alabama voluntary organizations active in disaster TAG2 . while under quarantine, the person shall take precautions as directed by his or her health care provider or the alabama department of public health to prevent the spread of the disease to others.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: where can i find the cities or zip codes of covid-19 cases QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: the alabama department of public health (adph) continues to review data related to covid-19. at this time, adph provides county level data on the  TAG2 covid-19 table TAG2  or our  TAG2 covid-19 data and surveillance dashboard TAG2 . when providing zip code and additional information, especially in rural areas with small populations, considerations regarding patient identity and privacy have to be taken into account. additionally, zip code data does not give a true picture of where a person may have contracted the disease since people do no remain in one zip code. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: does total tested include results from commercial labs QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: total tested reported currently represents tests that were satisfactorily performed by the alabama department of public health (adph) bureau of clinical laboratories (bcl), along with data from commercial and clinical labs. commercial and clinical labs are required by law to report all positive and all negative results for sars-cov-2 to adph.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: why is it that health officials will not give us more information about who is infected QUESTION  TAG2 a: alabama department of public health (adph) cannot disclose patient information due to hipaa. covid-19 is a four-hour notifiable disease, by law, in alabama. people who have covid-19 (cases) are investigated by adph infectious disease and outbreak division (covid-19 investigation team), and the case goes under home quarantine, unless hospitalized where they are also under quarantine. people who are in close contact (contacts) identified as part of the investigation are notified and placed under home quarantine as well. places of employment or businesses are contacted as part of the investigation. cases and contacts are not allowed to be out in public until instructed by adph that they may do so. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: i heard there is a death in my county. why does your dashboard or table not show the death QUESTION  TAG2 a: our deepest sympathies are with families and friends who lose loved ones during this outbreak. when a death occurs in a person who tested positive for covid-19, the record is reviewed by an alabama department of public health (adph) physician to determine factors related to death and any comorbid conditions. this investigation must be completed before any death is included in our official data. adph follows the guidance of the national vital statistics system (nvss) and the cdc. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: what are the current numbers of hospitalizations, patients in icu, and patients on ventilators in alabama hospitals QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: the alabama department of public health (adph) does not receive hospital discharge data making it difficult to collect all elements on patients discharged from the hospital with covid-19. other information changes daily as some patients are removed from ventilators or icu in one facility while patients in other facilities are being placed on ventilators or in icu. thus, data would be inaccurate. alabama is looking at ways to report patients who no longer have symptoms at the time of interview or are asymptomatic at the time of interview as measures of improvement. the term recovered does not have a uniform definition in covid-19 as of the moment. cumulative totals for hospitalizations, patients in icu, and patients on ventilators can be found on the  TAG2 alabama covid-19 data and surveillance dashboard TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: will cases be subtracted from the current number of cases or will it be separately reported QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a: cases will not be subtracted as this is the data on numbers of total cases. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: why does adph not report a case just because the resident lives out of state QUESTION  TAG2 a: non-residents will not be listed in our case counts. in the event we have a resident from another state test positive in our state, we notify the health department in their resident state and that state and the cdc counts the person as a case in the resident’s state. this information is from the  TAG2 council of state and territorial epidemiologists.

TAG2  TAG2 avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. TAG2  TAG2 practice “social distancing:” avoid close contact with people who are sick. stay at least six feet away from other people.  TAG2  TAG2 clean and disinfect high-touch objects and surfaces (counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables, light switches) using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. TAG2  TAG2 wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. if soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.  TAG2  TAG2 because infected people can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms, the cdc recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in addition, to help prevent the spread of the disease to others and prepare for possible infection: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 stay home when you are sick. TAG2  TAG2 cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue (and then dispose of this) or your elbow.  TAG2  TAG2  contact your health care provider to ask about getting an extra supply of your regular prescription medicines to have on hand if there is an outbreak of covid-19 in the community and you need to stay home for a long period of time. TAG2  TAG2 be sure you have over-the-counter medicines and supplies (tissues, etc.) to treat fever and other symptoms. most people will be able to recover from covid-19 at home.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 if they will not have a test to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened: they have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers) and other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved) and at least 10 days have passed since their symptoms first appeared. TAG2  TAG2 if they will be tested to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened: they no longer have a fever (without the use medicine that reduces fevers) and other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved) and they received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart.  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 how can i safely grocery shop QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 yes, you can safely go grocery shopping, but the best way to protect yourself and others is to limit exposure to the grocery store. this can be done by ordering delivery if that is possible, or reducing the number of shopping trips you take. try to only go to the store every one or two weeks. also try to limit the number of people who go on shopping trips. leave your kids at home if you can as they like to touch surfaces and can carry the virus without showing symptoms. TAG1  TAG1 other safe practices are wiping down the handles of your cart with disinfectant wipes before use and leaving your phone in your pocket while in the store. try to go back to a paper shopping list. if you bring reusable bags to the store you should wash them either with wipes or in the washing machine before using them again. TAG1  TAG1 to pay, it is safest to use contactless pay, like apple pay. credit cards and cash are safe as long as you are careful not to touch your face, and to disinfect your hands after you touch the pinpad.  TAG1  TAG1 the risk of going shopping is not the foods or packaging, but the people you encounter. however, you should always wash your hands before and after handling food. the cdc also recommends you wash your hands again after you unload your groceries, and clean kitchen surfaces like countertops, cabinet handles and light switches. TAG1  TAG1 it is not necessary to sanitize your groceries or leave them outside after purchasing them. the fda and cdc report that there is no evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the coronavirus that causes covid-19. wash your fruits and vegetables like you would under normal circumstances. TAG1  TAG1 the cdc recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). it is also essential to practice social distancing and stand six feet away from everyone in the store. try not to touch your face, use hand sanitizer and wash your hands as soon as possible. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the cdc has excellent  TAG2 advice to help prevent household members from getting infection if someone in the home has covid-19 TAG2 . these include sleeping in separate rooms, using separate bathrooms if possible, frequent hand-washing and staying more than six feet away from the infected person.  TAG1  TAG1 let your health care provider know right away if you are aware of having contact with a person who has tested positive for covid-19. your provider can determine if you need testing and provide more education on how to prevent further risk of infection to you and to prevent spread of infection to others.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 women with covid-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. they should: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask where available TAG2  TAG2 wash hands before and after touching the baby TAG2  TAG2 routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if you’re pregnant and concerned about how covid-19 can affect your health and the health of your baby, we have put together additional information about how to protect yourself, the risks of covid-19 to pregnant women and their babies, and more. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 what does it mean to be immunocompromised during covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 being immunocompromised means that your immune system's defenses are low, affecting its ability to fight off illness and infection, including covid-19. certain conditions like autoimmune diseases (i.e., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes), your age, and a history of smoking could increase the chance of infection. medical treatments, such as cancer treatments and organ and bone marrow transplants, can also weaken or suppress the immune system.  TAG1  TAG1 if you're immunocompromised, it's especially important to protect yourself by wearing a face covering or mask, washing your hands, frequently disinfecting high-touch surface areas and practicing social distancing. penn medicine has also put many  TAG2 safety measures TAG2  in place throughout our locations to reduce the risk of covid-19 exposure to even our most vulnerable patients.  TAG1  TAG1 to learn more, we recommend reading: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 is it safe for me to go to my upcoming doctor's appointment QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 we are taking extra steps to make sure all care environments and operating rooms are safe for patients and providers. we regularly and rigorously clean and disinfect waiting rooms and patient care areas; require masks or face coverings for all staff, patients and visitors; have made it easier to maximize physical distancing in our facilities; and implemented new processes such as contact-less check-in and check-out.

TAG1  TAG1 serology testing, or antibody testing, checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. these antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus. we do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with sars-cov-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus and if they do, how long this protection will last. TAG1  TAG1 at penn medicine, antibody testing is available for patients with specific clinical indications. while there is discussion about using these tests to determine who can safely go back to work, this is not yet in practice since we do not know if antibodies confer immunity. we are working to validate commercial antibody tests and make them more widely available. if you have additional questions about whether you are eligible for antibody testing, please contact your regular medical provider.

TAG1  TAG1 if you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 how can i get tested for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 if you are well, no testing is recommended. TAG2  if you are experiencing symptoms of covid-19, you should immediately isolate yourself from others. call your local un clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant travel/exposure history. if you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local ministry of health or who, please also indicate this. from here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 what alternatives do i have if there are no hand sanitizers available QUESTION  can i use other alcohol like ethyl or liquor QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and even better, alternative. liquor is not effective against coronavirus. for an alcohol-based hand rub to be effective, it must have an alcohol content of 60% to 95%. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 can people who recover from covid-19 be infected again QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 we know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover. however, because the immune response to covid-19 is not yet understood, it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients who have recovered from covid-19. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 is there a connection between covid -19 and environment temperature QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 it is not known yet if weather and temperature changes impact or has any connection with covid-19. at this time, it is not clear or known if the spread of covid-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 can i make my own hand sanitizer QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there are no studies supporting the effectiveness of homemade handsanitizer blend in killing the new coronavirus on people’s hands. expertsagree that the best method for cleaning hands is washing for at least 20seconds with soap and water. TAG1  TAG1 can coronavirus live on objects QUESTION  mail from affected areas QUESTION  clothes QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there is no evidence at present that items imported from affected areas and shipped or mailed over the course of days or weeks are spreading covid-19. although the new coronavirus weakens and dies over time outside of the human body, studies suggest that it can live on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, depending on surface, temperature and other environmental factors. for instance, a small amount of the new coronavirus is still detectable on plastic surfaces for up to three days, on stainless steel for up to two days and up to one day on cardboard,  TAG2 but it’s at less than 0.1% of the starting virus material TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 so far, evidence suggests that the virus does not survive as well on a soft surface (such as fabric) as it does on frequently touched hard surfaces like elevator buttons and door handles. TAG1  TAG1 more research will provide information on the coronavirus and how long it lives on surfaces. in the meantime,  TAG2 wash your hands thoroughly TAG2   after handling mail, and carefully dispose of all outer packaging.

TAG1  TAG1 here are some other suggestions: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 have one adult go shopping instead of the whole family, especially since children like to touch objects and then their faces. TAG2  TAG2 plan to stock up for at least a week so you can minimize the number of trips. TAG2  TAG2 when you’re at the store, stay at least 6 feet away from others. TAG2  TAG2  clean the handle of the shopping basket or cart with a disinfectant wipe or alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.  TAG2  TAG2 don’t touch your face, and keep your phone in your pocket because it may harbor viruses — use a paper list instead. TAG2  TAG2 hard surfaces are more likely to be contaminated than soft surfaces (such as fabric), so be mindful of commonly touched surfaces such as payment equipment and self-checkout machines. TAG2  TAG2 if you use reusable shopping bags, wipe them with disinfectant or launder them once you’ve put your groceries away. TAG2  TAG2 wear a  TAG2 cloth face covering TAG2  if you are not able to practice physical distancing while shopping. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 should i stop going to the gym QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 as the new coronavirus is spreading, be cautious about all possible exposures, including at the gym or fitness center. the virus isn’t spread through perspiration (sweat), but items touched by many people (barbells, etc.) could pose a risk. in order to practice  TAG2 social and physical distancing TAG2  during the covid-19 pandemic, it is best to avoid public places at this time. TAG1  TAG1 should i cancel my trip QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 at this time,  TAG2 social and physical distancing TAG2  are important to follow, so overall, travel is discouraged. outbreaks of the new coronavirus and covid-19, the disease it causes, are occurring in the united states and in countries around the world. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has  TAG2 updated travel information  TAG2 on a range of destinations. TAG1  TAG1 travelers should be cautious about cruise ship travel and situations that involve crowded places. you are less likely to catch the new coronavirus on airplanes because of circulation and filtering, but you may be asked about your infection risk when you book a flight. and be aware that you may be prevented from returning from certain sites should they be on lockdown.

TAG1  TAG1 agency TAG1  TAG1 march 30, 2020 TAG1  TAG1 what has ice done to protect detainees in ice custody QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 in march, ice’s enforcement and removal operations (ero) convened a working group between medical professionals, disease control specialists, detention experts, and field operators to identify additional enhanced steps to minimize the spread of the virus. ice has since evaluated its detained population based upon the cdc’s guidance for people who might be at higher risk for severe illness as a result of covid-19 to determine whether continued detention was appropriate. of this population, ice has released nearly 700 individuals after evaluating their immigration history, criminal record, potential threat to public safety, flight risk, and national security concerns. this same methodology is currently being applied to other potentially vulnerable populations currently in custody and while making custody determinations for all new arrests. additionally, ero has limited the intake of new detainees being introduced into the ice detention system. ice’s detained population has dropped by more than 4,000 individuals since march 1, 2020 with a more than 60 percent decrease in book-ins when compared to this time last year. TAG1  TAG1 agency TAG1  TAG1 april 15, 2020 TAG1  TAG1 what is ice doing to ensure detainees in custody are well-cared for during this crisis QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 currently, the cdc advises self-monitoring at home for people in the community who meet epidemiologic risk criteria, and who do not have fever or symptoms of respiratory illness. in detention settings, cohorting serves as an alternative to self-monitoring at home. TAG1  TAG1 comprehensive protocols are in place for the protection of staff and patients, including the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (ppe), in accordance with cdc guidance. ice has maintained a pandemic workforce protection plan since february 2014, which was last updated in may 2017. this plan provides specific guidance for biological threats such as covid-19. ice instituted applicable parts of the plan in january 2020 upon the discovery of the potential threat of covid-19. the ice occupational safety and health office is in contact with relevant offices within the department of homeland security, and in january 2020, the dhs workforce safety and health division provided dhs components additional guidance to address assumed risks and interim workplace controls. this includes the use of n95 masks, available respirators, and additional personal protective equipment. TAG1  TAG1 ice testing for covid-19 complies with cdc guidance. ihsc updates and shares its covid-19 guidance with field units on a real-time basis. subjects selected for testing follow cdc’s definition of a person under investigation. TAG1  TAG1 agency TAG1  TAG1 march 15, 2020 TAG1  TAG1 how does ice screen new detainees for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 ice instituted screening guidance for new detainees who arrive at facilities to identify those who meet cdc’s criteria for epidemiologic risk of exposure to covid-19. ihsc isolates detainees with fever and/or respiratory symptoms who meet these criteria and observe them for a specified time period. ihsc staff consult with the local health department, as appropriate, to assess the need for testing. detainees without fever or respiratory symptoms who meet epidemiologic risk criteria are monitored for 14 days. ero has also encouraged facilities to isolate new admissions into the detention network for 14 days before placing them into general population. TAG1  TAG1 agency TAG1  TAG1 march 15, 2020 TAG1  TAG1 how does ice mitigate the spread of covid-19 within its detention facilities QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 detainees who meet cdc criteria for epidemiologic risk of exposure to covid-19 are housed separately from the general population. ice places detainees with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a single medical housing room, or in a medical airborne infection isolation room specifically designed to contain biological agents, such as covid-19. this prevents the spread of the agent to other individuals and the general public. ice transports individuals with moderate to severe symptoms, or those who require higher levels of care or monitoring, to appropriate hospitals with expertise in high-risk care. detainees who do not have fever or symptoms, but meet cdc criteria for epidemiologic risk, are housed separately in a single cell, or as a group, depending on available space. ice reviews cdc guidance daily and continues to update protocols to remain consistent with cdc guidance. TAG1  TAG1 agency TAG1  TAG1 april 6, 2020 TAG1  TAG1 do ice facilities have necessary sanitary products to help guard against the virus QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 in addition to providing detainees with soap for the shower and hand soap for sink handwashing, ice provides alcohol-based sanitizer in visitor entrances, exits, waiting areas and to staff and detainees in the secure setting whenever possible. ice also provides soap and paper towels that are present in bathrooms and work areas within the facilities. everyday cleaning supplies such as soap dispensers and paper towels are routinely checked and are available for use. detainees are encouraged to communicate with local staff when additional hygiene supplies or products are needed. TAG1  TAG1 performance-based national detention standards (pbnds) 2008 and pbnds 2011, require that facilities operating under these respective standards have written plans that address the management of communicable diseases, which should include isolation and management of detainees exposed to communicable diseases. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) remains the definitive source for information about how to protect individuals and reduce exposure to the virus, so ice continues to encourage facilities to follow cdc guidelines as well as those of their state and local health departments. TAG1  TAG1 agency TAG1  TAG1 april 2, 2020 TAG1  TAG1 how are ice detention facilities engaging in social distancing QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 in march, ice’s enforcement and removal operations (ero) convened a working group between medical professionals, disease control specialists, detention experts, and field operators to identify additional enhanced steps to minimize the spread of the virus. as a result of the working group, ero decided to reduce the population of all detention facilities to 70 percent or less to increase social distancing. detention facilities may also increase social distancing by having staggered meals and recreation times in order to limit the number of detainees gathered together. all community service projects are suspended until further notice.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what’s the difference between testing and screening for covid-19 QUESTION  who gets what QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the screening process begins when you contact your provider or the mhs nurse advice line to discuss your symptoms and it will begin with a series of questions.  TAG1  TAG1 the nurse or staff member decides whether your symptoms may be due to covid-19 or another illness requiring treatment. you might get advice on self-care since symptoms often can be treated at home. TAG1  TAG1 the nurse/staff member may arrange a telephone visit between you and a health care provider or tell you to call your provider directly. the provider can talk with you about possible exposure, your symptoms, and discusses treatment. the provider may give you self-care advice to use at home. or, he or she may tell you to go to your primary care clinic or emergency to be tested. TAG1  TAG1 it’s important to call first so we can protect you, other patients, and medical staff from unnecessary exposure to covid-19. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 how much does the test cost QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the covid-19 test is free. the covid-19 test should only be done when your provider thinks your symptoms show likely infection. TAG2  TAG2 effective march 18, under the families first coronavirus response act, tricare is also waiving copays for doctor-ordered covid 19 testing office visits.     TAG2  TAG2 the law doesn't waive copayments and cost-shares for the treatment due to infection. copays and cost shares remain the same for tricare program and plans. TAG2  TAG2 under tricare you have fairly low out-of-pocket costs, a catastrophic cap and protection against balance billing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 active duty service members and adfms under prime do not have cost-shares and so are not impacted by this law. TAG2  TAG2 due to the claims billing process and modifications, tricare can't immediately waive all copayments and cost-shares. beneficiaries may have to pay up front and file a claims for reimbursement until the contractors can modify their systems. TAG2  TAG2 if you receive a prescription for medication, your copay still applies. by law, tricare can't waive pharmacy copays. consider filling your medication through home delivery or at a retail pharmacy depending on your mtfs operating status.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 when will clinics test based on exposure only QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 there is cdc-published criteria to guide healthcare providers. they are encouraged to use their own medical judgment for testing purposes. providers usually base testing on your exposure and symptoms. also, you may have another illness or infections that may be making you sick, like the flu or a nasal infection.  providers may choose to rule out these other cases before testing for the coronavirus.  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the dod follows cdc guidelines. currently, csc does not recommended testing every single person who wants to be tested. there is a limited supply of covid-19 tests due to the needs for tests and the production of testing supplies. the volume of testing supplies, personnel, and other resources affects how many tests a lab can run. military medical hospitals and clinics are reserving and prioritizing covid-19 testing for active duty service members with or without symptoms.  this is part of a greater dod strategy to reduce risk to the force.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 tricare benefit TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what, if any, copayments will be waived related to covid-19 treatment and testing QUESTION  how does this apply to active duty, reserve component, and retirees QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the covid-19 test is only being done when a provider thinks your symptoms show likely infection. the testing is free. TAG2  TAG2 the covid-19 test is free. the covid-19 test should only be done when your provider thinks your symptoms show likely infection. TAG2  TAG2 effective march 18, under the families first coronavirus response act, tricare is also waiving copays for doctor-ordered covid 19 testing office visits.     TAG2  TAG2 the law doesn't waive copayments and cost-shares for the treatment due to infection. copays and cost shares remain the same for tricare program and plans. TAG2  TAG2 under tricare you have fairly low out-of-pocket costs, a catastrophic cap and protection against balance billing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 note: TAG2  you may pay out of pocket if you receive a test from a location that’s not a tricare-authorized provider. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 active duty service members and adfms under prime do not have cost-shares and so are not impacted by this law. TAG2  TAG2 due to the claims billing process and modifications, tricare can't immediately waive all copayments and cost-shares. beneficiaries may have to pay up front and file a claims for reimbursement until the contractors can modify their systems. TAG2  TAG2 if you receive a prescription for medication, your copay still applies. by law, tricare can't waive pharmacy copays. consider filling your medication through home delivery or at a retail pharmacy depending on your mtfs operating status. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 if you’re located overseas: TAG2  beneficiaries overseas with a cost-share (retirees and their family members, active duty family members (adfms) under tricare select, and tricare for life) may be eligible for cost share waivers. this is only if the covid-19 test with the visit meets the requirements of the law. it has to be fda approved, cleared, or authorized. some tests used and tricare-covered overseas may not meet this statutory requirement. this includes the world health organization test, which is not currently fda authorized.

TAG1  TAG1 what type of telehealth/telemedicine services does tricare cover QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 tricare covers many telehealth/telemedicine services when: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 medically or psychologically necessary, TAG2  TAG2 with a military or tricare-authorized provider. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 services may include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 primary, routine, and specialty care, TAG2  TAG2 behavioral health care like psychotherapy, family guidance/training from a board certified behavior analyst under the autism care demonstration, or TAG2  TAG2 physical therapy or occupational therapy. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 update: TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the department published an interim final rule on may 12, 2020. it makes three temporary changes to tricare regulation. the goal is to ensure you have access to care during the national health emergency due to the pandemic. TAG1  TAG1 with the rule change: TAG1  TAG1 1. tricare will temporarily pay for certain phone (audio-only) telehealth services. the visit must be medically or psychologically necessary. it must be appropriate. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 for example, you may have a phone visit with your provider to evaluate and manage your care, or you may have a psychotherapy visit. TAG2  TAG2 tricare won’t pay for all phone visits. some aren’t appropriate by phone, e.g. intensive outpatient programs. in these cases, your visit must be face-to-face or through audio-video channels.     TAG2  TAG2 if your care normally requires a physical exam, an audio-only visit isn’t appropriate. (this includes a remote physical exam using a “telepresenter”- which may be a nurse with digital tools and resources.) TAG2  TAG2 your provider can’t bill separately for administrative services. for example, he or she can’t bill for setting up the appointment or verifying your prescriptions. these costs are part of the audio-only visit itself. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 tricare billing and payment rules still apply. TAG2  TAG2 tricare program and plan rules still apply. for example, if you are tricare prime, you still need to get a pcm referral for specialty care. TAG2  TAG1 2. tricare is temporarily paying providers who practice across state or country lines. this only applies when federal, state, or host nation laws allow the out-of-state or international practice. it helps in areas where there is a high-need for health care services. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 it applies to both in-person and telemedicine services. TAG2  TAG2 federal, state, or host-nation licensing requirements apply.     TAG2  TAG2 stateside: the license has to permit practice out-of-state. TAG2  TAG2 overseas: the provider’s host-nation has to permit inter-country practice. the provider has to be licensed in both countries. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your provider can’t barred or restricted from practice in any state. he or she can’t be on the department of health and human services sanction list. TAG2  TAG1 3. tricare is temporarily waiving copays or cost-shares for telehealth services. this includes your deductible (if applicable). TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 this is for tricare-covered services from in-network providers. it’s not just for your covid-19 care. TAG2  TAG2 it’s for both prime and select enrollees. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 these temporary changes are in effect: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 starting may 12, 2020, for the united states. they will be in place until the end of the president’s declared national emergency TAG2  TAG2 starting march 10, 2020, overseas. they may be in place beyond the u.s. national emergency end date, based on local conditions. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 you may not see these changes right away as the contractors have to make system changes. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 if you have a question about a telehealth claim, reach out to your regional contractor. TAG2   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i have tricare and live overseas. many providers aren’t seeing patients in their offices. does tricare cover telemedicine here due to covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 tricare may cover telemedicine services overseas. services must be medically or psychologically necessary and appropriate.  TAG2  TAG2 civilian tricare overseas program (top) network or participating providers have to:     TAG2  TAG2 follow host nation country privacy laws  TAG2  TAG2 meet telemedicine credentialing requirements  TAG2  TAG2 follow tricare policy requirements TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 you still have to get required referrals, pre-approvals, or authorizations for services. if you have:     TAG2  TAG2 tricare overseas program (top) prime: your primary care manager (pcm) has to submit a “defer to network request (dtnr)” to the overseas contractor. the dtnr has to note the need for telemedicine services. TAG2  TAG2 top prime remote: you must call your top regional call center for all of your telemedicine services. this includes your first visit and follow-up visits that you may need. TAG2  TAG2 if you self-refer for services, you must see a telemedicine credentialed provider. this would apply if you choose to self-refer for some outpatient mental health services.     TAG2  TAG2 active duty service members must get pre-authorization for all types of mental health care that they seek. this will come from your pcm at your military hospital or clinic or from the overseas contractor. TAG2  TAG2 telemedicine must have both live video and audio for tricare to cover it. tricare doesn’t cover telemedicine services through:     TAG2  TAG2 audio-only conferencing TAG2  TAG1 to learn more, contact your  TAG2 top regional call center TAG2 .

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 the iop, or php providing iop services, by telehealth must be at the same intensity and level of services required by those programs per policy.  TAG2 the provider has to show its offering all components of the iop via telehealth (e.g., at least 2 hours of services). iops have to document all services via telehealth in the medical records and on the claim. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 medication assisted treatment (mat) and opioid treatment programs (otp) TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 tricare may cover mat and opt services by telehealth when appropriate. TAG2   TAG2 the mat and opt must meet samhsa regulations and guidance.  see  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/otp-guidance-20200316.pdf TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  and  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/faqs-for-oud-prescribing-and-dispensing.pdf TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1 quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of people who aren’t sick who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to see if they become ill. these people may have been exposed to a disease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms. quarantine can also help limit the spread of communicable disease.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will the screening measures only be for those landing in level 2 or 3 locations QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 no, this policy applies to all personnel who travel or have recently traveled. however, the actions we expect our leaders and people to take are dependent upon their travel routes and locations. at this time, all countries other than the united states are either level 2 or level 3, which requires screening whether it was for travel to, from, or through.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 cdc knows that wearing cloth face coverings may not be possible in every situation or for some people. in some situations, wearing a cloth face covering may worsen a physical or mental health condition, lead to a medical emergency, or introduce significant safety concerns.  TAG2 for example, TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if you are  TAG2 deaf or hard of hearing TAG2 —or if you care for or interact with a person who is  TAG2 hearing impaired TAG2 —you have problems if you rely on lipreading to communicate. in this case, consider asking others to use a clear face covering. if that’s not possible, ask them to consider using written communication, closed captioning, or decreasing background noise while wearing a cloth face covering that blocks your lips. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 some people with  TAG2 developmental disabilities, sensory integration concerns or tactile sensitivities, certain mental health conditions, or limited cognitive ability  TAG2 may have a negative reaction to wearing a cloth face covering. they should consult with their healthcare provider as part of the decision to wear a cloth face covering. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 younger children TAG2  TAG2  (e.g., preschool or early elementary aged) may be unable to wear a cloth face covering properly, especially for a long period. have your children wear cloth face coverings when it’s hard to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others (e.g., during carpool drop off or pick up, or when standing in line at school). ensure your child’s face covering is the right size and fit. teach and remind your children about how important it is to wear face coverings. make sure they wear the covering correctly.  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 don’t wear cloth face coverings while in activities that may cause the cloth face covering to become wet, like when swimming at the beach or pool. a wet cloth face covering may make it difficult to breathe. for these activities like swimming, it is important to maintain physical distance from others when in the water.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how is covid-19 spread QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 this new coronavirus, sars-cov-2, spreads from person to person through close contact, most often by respiratory droplets that are spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. it can also be spread by close contact interactions like hand shaking and hugging. it may be possible to catch the virus from a contaminated surface (such as door handles, tabletops, shopping carts) if you subsequently touch your mouth, nose or eyes. people are thought to be most contagious when they have symptoms, but even those who are not experiencing symptoms or have mild symptoms can spread the virus. recent studies indicate that covid-19 can be transmitted  TAG2 before TAG2  infected individuals begin to show symptoms. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what are the symptoms of covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 fever TAG2  TAG2 new loss of smell and/or taste TAG2  TAG2 some transplant recipients may develop pneumonia  TAG2  TAG2 rash TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 this list is not all-inclusive. if you develop symptoms concerning for covid-19, contact your transplant center right away. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how is covid-19 treated QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 most people with covid 19 who have mild to moderate symptoms will recover on their own with supportive care.  less commonly, covid-19 may be severe and have serious complications requiring hospitalization or death. TAG1  TAG1 currently, there are no treatments approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for covid-19.  there are many ongoing clinical trials for potential antiviral and immune based therapies for the treatment of covid-19.  remdesivir, an antiviral medication, may be beneficial and the fda has issued an emergency use authorization (eua), which allows for emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 at this time, there are no vaccines effective against this virus, although studies to develop these are ongoing.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: what can i do to protect myself and others from covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a: TAG2   there are several things you can do to protect yourself. some examples include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 wash your hands or use hand sanitizer frequently TAG2  TAG2 avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose TAG2  TAG2 avoid large crowds TAG2  TAG2 practice social distancing by staying at least six feet from other people and groups TAG2  TAG2 frequently clean and disinfect high contact surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, and faucets TAG2  TAG2 stay at home if you are sick TAG2  TAG2 wear a face covering when you leave the house TAG2  TAG2 practice cough and sneeze etiquette (see figure below) TAG2  TAG2  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 here  TAG2  TAG2 is some additional advice from the cdc to protect the spread of covid-19 in children. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: is it safe for me to go outside or should i avoid public spaces QUESTION  should i wear a mask QUESTION  should i wear gloves QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a: TAG2  in most areas of the country, it is safe to be outdoors provided you follow some basic safety guidelines. local and state public health authorities will determine many of these, so it is important to stay up to date. transplant recipients should  TAG2 avoid crowds TAG2  and large gatherings, practice social distancing, and wash their hands often. TAG1  TAG1 wearing cloth face coverings in public settings is also mandatory or highly recommended for all individuals, and transplant candidates and recipients should follow that guidance. TAG1  TAG1 the cloth face coverings  TAG2  TAG2 recommended by the cdc  TAG2  TAG2  are not surgical masks or n-95 respirators and they are not designed to protect the person wearing them. rather, masks or cloth face coverings will prevent someone who does not know they are infected from spreading the virus to others.  it is important to remember that the wearing of a mask should continue to be combined with good hand hygiene. TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2  TAG2 cdc does not recommend TAG2  TAG2  wearing gloves under most circumstances. instead, transplant candidates and recipients should wash their hands often. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: what is social distancing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 social distancing TAG2  TAG2  is thought to be the best way to limit the spread of coronavirus. it means keeping space, at least 6 feet apart, between yourself and other people outside of your home, even when no one in that space has symptoms. this includes both indoor and outdoor places. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: am i at higher risk of getting covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a: TAG2  we do not yet have specific information on whether covid-19 infection will spread more easily among transplant candidates or recipients. however, experts are worried that this may be the case since chronic disease or immunosuppression usually lowers the amount of virus needed to cause infections. most reports so far indicate transplant recipients are getting covid-19 from the community, although frequent contact with the health care system may also be a risk.  this is why it is important for you to take every precaution possible to avoid being infected. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: what should i do if i have covid or flu-like/respiratory symptoms QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a:  TAG2  the first step is to separate yourself from others. there are many different causes for fever, cough, shortness of breath, stomach upset, and flu-like symptoms, but you should get tested for covid-19. it is important to remember that most people, including transplant candidates and recipients, experience only mild to moderate symptoms recover from covid-19 without problems. many do not need hospitalization but are able to stay at home in isolation. TAG1  TAG1 other steps to take include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 contact  TAG2 your transplant center first TAG2  before going to a hospital or clinic. TAG2  TAG2 if you must leave home, place a surgical mask or cloth covering on when in public to avoid the spread of infection to anyone else. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 wash your hands TAG2  often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. this is especially important after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 clean and disinfect TAG2  high-touch surfaces* in your “sick room” and bathroom; wear disposable gloves while disinfecting. TAG2  TAG2 if you are in home isolation, monitor your symptoms and seek emergency attention if you have trouble breathing, chest pain, confusion, severe fatigue. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 *high-touch surface include phones, remote controls, counters, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, bedside tables TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: how can i get tested to see if i have covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a:  TAG2 testing availability has improved throughout the united states and is available through different mechanisms in different locations. if you believe you need to be tested for covid-19, call your transplant team for further instructions, as they will be aware of what is available in your area. TAG1  TAG1 there are 2 types of testing available at this time:  TAG2  TAG2 the direct viral test (pcr) and the antibody (serology) test TAG2  TAG2 . these 2 tests tell providers different things about a person’s exposure to covid-19. the pcr test tells providers whether someone is currently infected, and it is performed by placing a swab into the nostril. the antibody test informs providers if someone was previously infected withcovid-19. from what we know so far, it takes about 1-3 weeks after the initial exposure for our bodies to develop antibodies. we do not know if having antibodies to this coronavirus protects from reinfection or how long that protection may last. we also do not know if everyone infected with sars-cov-2 will make the antibodies. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: is it safe for me to go to the hospital for appointments QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a: TAG2  healthcare facilities, including transplant centers, have put a lot of effort into keeping patients safe from covid-19. a few examples of this include isolating patients with or suspected to have covid-i9 as well as limiting routine doctor and laboratory visits.  most centers are conducting telemedicine clinic visits to maintain safety. please contact your transplant team for further information on these efforts. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: i am awaiting a transplant. could i get covid-19 from my donor QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a:  TAG2 the risk of acquiring covid-19 from organ donation is unknown at this time but thought to be low. organ procurement organizations are screening all potential donors for covid-19 symptoms and exposure history. most potential donors are tested for covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 the majority of transplant centers have also taken careful steps to screen living donors, including checking for symptoms, exposures and even viral testing.  at some centers, living donors are being asked to not travel to high-risk areas and to isolate themselves before donation and monitor for symptoms. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: i had covid-19. when can i stop self-isolating QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a TAG2 : even after recovering from covid-19, you should stay home as much as possible, and practice social distancing. there are still many unanswered questions about covid-19, including how long the virus remains in the body and whether it is possible to get sick with covid-19 again.  contact your transplant center for guidance on when it will be safe to leave home for essential care, basic, needs, and/or solitary exercise. some basic parameters might include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 your illness has resolved TAG2  TAG2 it has been at least 10 days since your symptoms first started TAG2  TAG2 you have not had a fever for three days without the use of fever reducing drugs like acetaminophen or ibuprofen  TAG2  TAG2 your transplant center may require you to have a negative pcr test prior to re-entering the clinic TAG2  TAG2  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: i had covid-19. when can i be cleared for transplant QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a:  TAG2 transplant centers have different policies on this, and you should contact your specific center for more details once you are symptom free. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: are there any travel or other restrictions for transplant recipients QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a: TAG2  travel increases your chances of getting and spreading covid-19. traveling may be especially dangerous if you, your travel companions, or those at your destination are at high-risk for contracting covid-19 TAG1  TAG1 we currently recommend that transplant recipients: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 avoid all travel unless absolutely necessary  TAG2 (no cruises, consider air travel only in dire circumstances). we also highly suggest that transplant recipients’ immediate household contacts should postpone non-essential travel. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 stay home TAG2  as much as possible and put distance between you and other people if you must be out (stay 6 feet away, which is about two arm lengths). TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 avoid crowds TAG2  (places of worship, concerts, shopping malls).

TAG2  TAG2 monitor for symptoms (see above) and contact your transplant coordinator immediately if you develop fever, cough or shortness of breath. TAG2  TAG2 those with suspected or confirmed covid-19 (including those awaiting test results) should stay at home and try to separate themselves from other people and animals in the household.

TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: how does covid-19 impact children who are awaiting or received a transplant QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a: TAG2  children of all ages can get infected with covid-19, but children seem to have milder symptoms compared to adults. for example, it is less common for children to report fever, cough or shortness of breath. severe covid-19 cases do occur in children, and immunosuppression as well as underlying health conditions such as chronic heart and lung diseases appear to be risk factors. fortunately, very few cases of children who are transplant recipients have been reported so far. one unique presentation of covid-19 in children is multisystem inflammatory syndrome (mis-c). mis-c is a very rare condition where several parts in the body show high levels of inflammation. this can be severe at times and may require hospitalization. although experts do not know what exactly causes mis-c, there appears to be a connection to covid-19. more information on mis-c can be found  TAG2  TAG2 here TAG2  TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: my child had a transplant. is it safe for her/him to go back to school (or camp) when it reopens QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a:  TAG2 before your child returns to school/camp please consider factors such as the number of cases in your community, the protective measures the school or camp is enforcing, and if social distancing is possible. we recommend your child wear a mask while at school or camp and continue frequent hand washing. monitor your child closely for symptoms and call your physician immediately if they develop symptoms. even with safety plans in place, some high-risk children may need to continue distance learning. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 q: my child had a transplant. can we visit friends or family QUESTION    TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a: TAG2   when deciding whether to visit friends and family it is important to consider the potential risks factors involved: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the rate of transmission in your community TAG2  TAG2 who is visiting (number of people, likelihood of covid-19 exposure) TAG2  TAG2 is anyone at risk for serious complications if they get covid-19 (such as the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions, transplant recipients) TAG2  TAG2 is it possible to remain socially distant during the visit TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as the prevalence of covid-19 in different parts of the country continues to vary, the risk of visiting others will change over time. it is important to keep up to date with your local public health department’s and/or cdc’s guidance. if you decide to see others, please continue to take TAG2  TAG2 measures to protect  TAG2  TAG2 yourself and them (see question 1 above). we recommend discussion with your transplant team if you have specific concerns regarding visitation.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what does it mean to quarantine TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 those in quarantine should try to keep six to 10 feet of distance between themselves and another person, and avoid prolonged contact while in an enclosed space. they should also: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2     sleep in a separate room from others TAG2  TAG2 practice strict cough etiquette (cover sneeze or cough with sleeve) TAG2  TAG2 practice strict hand hygiene TAG2  TAG2 avoid sharing utensils, dishware or drinking cups     TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as the cdc explains: “quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. for covid-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. someone who has been released from covid-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what should i do if i have no symptoms and want to stay healthy and prevent the spread of covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 recent studies suggest a significant number of people with covid-19 don’t have any symptoms and those who develop symptoms spread germs before the symptoms appear. in light of this evidence, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) is recommending people wear cloth masks in addition to practicing social distancing. (h TAG2 ere are the cdc instructions on how to make and wear a cloth mask TAG2 )  TAG1  TAG1 in general, practicing routine hygiene etiquette is the best way to prevent the spread of infection: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 stay home when you're sick TAG2  TAG2 avoid close contact with people who are sick TAG2  TAG2 get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals TAG2  TAG2 cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you sneeze or cough TAG2  TAG2 wash your hands often with soap and water (20 seconds or longer) or use alcohol hand rub if no soap and water are available TAG2  TAG2 avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands or after touching surfaces TAG2  TAG2 clean and disinfect &quot;high-touch&quot; surfaces often TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if you’re seriously ill, seek medical advice from a doctor or emergency department. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 how does covid-19 spread QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 based on current cdc guidance, person-to-person spread most likely occurs through respiratory droplets between people in close proximity, similar to influenza and other respiratory viruses. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 prolonged exposure within six feet of an infected person would put you at risk for getting the virus. TAG2  TAG2 the period from exposure to symptom onset is believed to be within 14 days.     TAG2  TAG2 for example, if a person returned from an outbreak area more than 14 days ago, the person would be outside the window for disease onset. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 practicing routine hygiene practices daily is the best way to prevent the spread of infection:     TAG2  TAG2 cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. TAG2  TAG2 wash your hands with soap and water or use alcohol hand rub regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing. TAG2  TAG2 avoid close contact with people that are sick. TAG2  TAG2 anyone who is ill should keep a safe distance (at least 3 feet) from others to reduce the risk of transmitting germs.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 who should be tested for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 effective monday, may 11, anyone who does not currently have symptoms of	 the coronavirus, but suspects or is concerned he/she has been exposed,	 may visit one of two meritus health screening centers and be tested for	 covid-19.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how does covid-19 spread QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 	current understanding about	 TAG2 how covid-19 spreads TAG2  is largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses. covid-19	 is a new disease, and there is more to learn about how it spreads, the	 severity of illness it causes and to what extent it may spread in the	 united states. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 person-to-person spread TAG2 : the virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, between		 people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)		 and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs		 or sneezes. these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who		 are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.	 TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects TAG2 : it may be possible that a person can get covid-19 by touching a surface		 or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth,		 nose or eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.	 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 people are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic	 (the sickest). some spread might be possible before people show symptoms,	 but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. TAG1  TAG1 there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging, because	 of poor survivability of other coronaviruses on surfaces. currently there	 is no evidence to support transmission of covid-19 associated with imported	 goods, but there is still a lot that is unknown about how the newly emerged	 covid-19 spreads.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 have a general question about covid-19 QUESTION  call the dhec care line at  TAG2 1-855-472-3432 TAG2  between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily. TAG1  TAG1 for mental health or substance abuse services related to covid-19 call the statewide support line 24/7at  TAG2 1-844-724-6737 TAG2  (1-844-sc-hopes). TAG1  TAG1 what is social distancing QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 social distancing TAG2  means staying home as much as possible, staying at least 6 feet away from other people while in public, and avoiding gatherings with many people present. recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms may also play a role in the spread of covid-19. everyone should wash their hands frequently, for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.  these are the best ways to protect yourself and our communities from the spread of covid-19.  TAG1  TAG1 should i wear a face mask QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 you could spread covid-19 to others if you are infected with the virus even if you do not feel sick. it is recommended that everyone wear a  TAG2 cloth face cover TAG2  when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities. cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.  the cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected. do not use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker. continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. the cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing. TAG1  TAG1 what is quarantine QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 quarantine is used to separate people who are close contacts of someone with a contagious disease, like covid-19, from others for a period of time to see if they become sick.  this is a method to prevent the spread of disease.  when someone is quarantining, they should stay home and avoid contact with other people until the quarantine period is over. this includes people in their household as much as it is possible. TAG1  TAG1 for covid-19, the quarantine period is 14 days from the time of last exposure to the person with covid-19.  for those who live in the same house as someone who has covid-19, they should continue to quarantine until seven (7) days after the date the person with covid-19 is told they no longer need to practice isolation. TAG1  TAG1 what is isolation QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 similar to quarantine, isolation is recommended for those who are sick with symptoms of covid-19 and have tested positive or are waiting on the results of a test. as with quarantine, they must remain at home or the place they were told to isolate and avoid contact with other people until their isolation period is over. this includes those in their household as much as possible. TAG1  TAG1 generally the isolation period for covid-19 continues until each of these conditions is met: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 your respiratory symptoms (such as cough and shortness of breath) are better - and – TAG2  TAG2 at least 10 days have passed since your illness onset – and – TAG2  TAG2 you have had no fever for at least 3 days (72 hours) and have not used fever-reducing medication during that time. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 people should talk with their doctor about how long they should plan to isolate. in certain situations, some may be required to be retested before ending isolation. TAG1  TAG1 what does it mean to be a close contact of someone with covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of someone who tested positive for covid-19 for at least several minutes (usually about 15 minutes).  the virus is spread primarily from person to person through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. it may be possible that a person can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose.  that is why it is so important to wash your hands often and clean TAG2  frequently touched surfaces TAG2  at least daily. TAG1  TAG1 i am a close contact to someone who tested positive for covid-19. what should i do QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a person who is sick with covid-19 is most likely to spread the covid-19 virus to others just before they have symptoms and at the beginning of their symptoms. that is why anyone who is sick should avoid contact with others and stay home unless leaving to get medical care.  it may be possible that a person can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose.  that is why it is so important to wash your hands often.  if you are a close contact to a person with covid-19, it is recommended that you self-quarantine and stay away from other people as much as possible for 14 days from the last date of exposure to the person. TAG1  TAG1 i was in the same room/building as someone who tested positive covid-19, but not in close contact with him/her. what should i do QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 if you were not in close contact with someone with covid-19, your risk of catching the virus from that person is low.  follow the general precautions, including social distancing, washing your hands often and avoid close contact with people who are sick. TAG1  TAG1 i was a close contact to someone who is sick but not tested for covid-19. what should i do QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 if you were around someone while they had symptoms, like fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, you may have been exposed to the covid-19 virus or another respiratory virus that causes similar symptoms, like the flu or the common cold. you should continue to practice social distancing, wash your hands often and monitor for symptoms. TAG1  TAG1 if you develop any symptoms, you should isolate at home and avoid contact with other people. call your doctor or other healthcare provider to discuss the need to be tested for covid-19. some people who are experiencing these symptoms may have another virus, or it could be seasonal allergies (hay fever). TAG1  TAG1 resources are available at the cdc website:  TAG2 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 i have symptoms but did not get tested. how long do i need to stay isolated QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 if symptoms are mild, it may not be necessary to test. those who can isolate at home for at least ten days after their symptoms start could consider doing that if testing was not available. it is recommended that you do isolate and avoid contact with others until: TAG1  TAG1 your respiratory symptoms (such as cough and shortness of breath) are better - and – at least 10 days have passed since your illness onset – and you have had no fever for at least 3 days (72 hours) and have not used fever-reducing medication during that time. TAG1  TAG1 i have been around someone else who was exposed to a person with covid-19. what should i do QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 to be exposed to covid-19 you must be around the person who had it when they had symptoms or within 2 days of when their symptoms started. if you were not, you may not have been exposed to the virus. TAG1  TAG1 it is recommended to watch for symptoms, avoid close contact with people who are sick, wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, and practice social distancing. TAG1  TAG1 i live in the same house as someone who is under quarantine. what should i do QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 quarantine separates people who were exposed to a contagious disease, like covid-19, to see if they become sick and prevent spread of disease.  for covid-19, the quarantine period is 14 days after the person’s last exposure to someone with covid-19.  if you are in a house that also has a quarantined individual, that person should try as much as possible to keep their distance from the others in the house. this can understandably be a great challenge, especially when the quarantined individual is a child or a parent caring for a child. TAG1  TAG1 try to keep the person in their own room, if possible and use a separate bathroom, if available. before going into shared areas, the person quarantining should wash their hands, try to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between themselves and others, and cover any coughs or sneezes. clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily and do not share personal household items like dishes, glasses, utensils or towels. others in the house should also maintain good hand washing habits. the quarantined individual should immediately isolate if they become sick and contact his/her healthcare provider. TAG1  TAG1 i am caring for someone who is sick with symptoms of covid-19. what should i do QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 if the person is well enough to not need close care, they should stay in one room, away from other people. if possible, have them use a separate bathroom. avoid sharing personal household items, like dishes, towels and bedding. if the sick person needs to be around others, they should wear a facemask, if available. if the sick person can’t wear a facemask, you should wear one while in the same room, if available. always wash your hands while caring for them, as well as frequently throughout the day.  frequently, at least every day, clean all surfaces that are touched often.  avoid having any unnecessary visitors.  monitor the person for worsening symptoms and if the person is getting sicker, call their healthcare provider.  for medical emergencies, call 911 and make sure to notify them that the person has covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 more information is available at the cdc website:  TAG2 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 should i get tested if i am not sick QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 the test that is done with a swab of the nose or mouth detects if the virus is present. there is a delay between the time that someone is exposed to the virus and the time that the virus can be detected through this testing. it can only be reliably detected when someone is sick with symptoms. if someone tests negative for the virus when they are not sick, this does not mean they will not eventually become sick. this should be considered when someone gets tested when they do not have symptoms. TAG1  TAG1 should i get the antibody test to determine if i had the virus QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there are many new tests on the market that test for antibodies against the virus. we are still learning about these tests. dhec does not recommend using them for someone who is sick to determine if they are currently infected with the virus. any results should be interpreted carefully understanding that the reliability of the tests is not known at this time.  TAG2 no one should assume they are immune to the virus on the basis of the antibody tests TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 can families visit their loved ones residing in nursing homes and assisted living facilities QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 on friday, march 13, 2020, governor mcmaster signed an  TAG2 executive order TAG2  that directed dhec to restrict visitation to nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the state, with the exception of end-of-life situations. the governor’s order is still in place and therefore families should not visit residents at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, unless they meet the exception of their loved one being in an end-of-life situation. more information regarding what constitutes an end-of-life situation and additional visitation details are available in the  TAG2 updated faqs for nursing homes and assisted living facilities TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 can i visit businesses that provide tanning services, tattoos, and body piercings QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 facilities that provide these services were authorized to reopen in limited capacity on may 18, 2020, as per the  TAG2 governor's may 11, 2020 press conference TAG2 . we encourage you to first contact the facilities providing these services to make sure that they have voluntarily chosen to reopen. if open for business, these facilities should adhere to  TAG2 dhec’s reopening guidance for close-contact services TAG2  and the  TAG2 cdc's reopening guidance TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 what are reopening guidelines QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 these guidelines are intended to assist both businesses and customers as places previously closed or who reduced their workforce during the pandemic begin to reopen.  they are not laws, so they cannot be enforced. they are recommended practices to prevent the spread of covid-19. TAG1  TAG1 a guideline for reopening is not a requirement to reopen, nor a requirement for customers to visit open establishments. some businesses may decide to remain closed, just as some customers may decide to continue to stay home. TAG1  TAG1 the general guidelines of social distancing, frequent hand washing, covering coughs or sneezes, cleaning and disinfecting commonly used surfaces, and not touching faces with unwashed hands, remains good health practices in addition to other specific guidelines that may be in place. TAG1  TAG1 where can i find reopening guidelines QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 you can find reopening guidelines on the governor’s  TAG2 acceleratesc TAG2  website. check the website regularly for updates and/or new guidance documents.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 tags TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 share this resource TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 downloads &amp; links TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","FAQ"

TAG2  TAG2 through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. TAG2  TAG2 these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. TAG2  TAG2 covid‑19 may be spread by people who are not showing any symptoms. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the virus may also be spread through surfaces: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 by a person touching a surface or object that has virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.

TAG1  TAG1 many modern air conditioning systems will either filter out or dilute the virus. ventilation systems with highly effective filters are a key way to eliminate droplets from the air, said harvard environmental health researcher joseph gardner allen. TAG1  TAG1 filters are rated by a  TAG2 merv system TAG2  –  their “minimum efficiency reporting value” that specifies their ability to trap tiny particles. the merv ratings go from 1 to 20. the higher the number, the better the filtration.  TAG1  TAG1 hepa filters have the highest merv ratings, between 17 and 20. hepa filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases. they’re able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns.  TAG1  TAG1 for context, this new coronavirus is thought to be  TAG2 between 0.06 to 1.4 microns in size TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 but “hepa filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,” allen said. “but there are other filters that can do the job. what is recommended now by the standard setting body for hvac is a merv 13 filter.”  TAG1  TAG1 high-efficiency filters in the 13-to-16 merv range are often used in hospitals, nursing homes, research labs and other places where filtration is important. TAG1  TAG1 “if you’re an owner of a home, building or mall, you want to have someone to assess your system and install the largest merv number filter the system can reliably handle without dropping the volume of air that runs through it,” advised erin bromage, an associate professor of biology at the university of massachusetts dartmouth. TAG1  TAG1 “in addition, virtually all modern air conditioning systems in commercial buildings have a process called makeup air where they bring in air from outside and condition it and bring it inside,” bromage said. “it’s worse in regards to energy, but the more outside air we bring in, the more dilution of the virus we have and then the safer you are.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2 family TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2 schools/education TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should we clean our cell phones daily QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 yes, that’s a good idea because cell phones are basically “ TAG2 petri dishes in our pockets TAG2 ” when you consider how many surfaces you touch before touching your phone. TAG1  TAG1 you should regularly disinfect your mobile phone anyway, with or without a coronavirus pandemic.  TAG1  TAG1 “there’s probably quite a lot of microorganisms on there, because you’re holding them against your skin, you are handling them all the time, and also you’re speaking into them,” said mark fielder, a professor of medical microbiology at kingston university.

TAG1  TAG1 “cloth face coverings are a critical preventive measure and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult,” the cdc says. TAG1  TAG1 clinical and laboratory studies show cloth face coverings reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth – what the cdc refers to as “source control.” and many people are contagious even when they don’t have any symptoms and don’t know they’re infected.  TAG1  TAG1 face shields worn  TAG2 in addition to masks TAG2  can provide an added layer of protection and  TAG2 can also help people stop touching their faces TAG2 . workers who are around people for long periods of time, such as grocery store workers or hospital personnel, may want to wear face shields in addition to masks, to increase their protection. TAG1  TAG1 if someone must use a face shield without a mask, the cdc says the shield “should wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin. disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2 schools/education TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 my kids don’t want to wear a mask. what should i do QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 children can be more reluctant because they’re more sensitive to new things than adults are, said christopher willard, a psychiatry lecturer at harvard medical school. TAG1  TAG1 “there’s also the weird psychological aspect of not being able to see their own face or other people’s faces and facial expressions,” which can hinder their feelings of comfort or safety, he said. TAG1  TAG1 to  TAG2 ease their mask fears TAG2 , try buying or making masks with fun designs on them. or have your child customize his or her own masks by drawing on them with markers.

TAG1  TAG1 some medical professionals differentiate between truly asymptomatic carriers – those who don’t currently have and will never have symptoms – from “pre-symptomatic” carriers – those who don’t have symptoms now, but will get them later. but the general public often uses the term “asymptomatic” to describe both categories of infected people. TAG1  TAG1 regardless of which term you use, researchers have found that about  TAG2 half of coronavirus transmissions happen between people who don’t have any symptoms TAG2 . and in some cases, people are  TAG2 more contagious before they start showing symptoms TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1 “sars was also a coronavirus, and it was a new virus at the time,” gupta said. “in the end, we know that sars ended up infecting 8,000 people around the world and causing around 800 deaths. so very high fatality rate, but it didn’t turn out to be very contagious.” TAG1  TAG1 the swine flu, or h1n1, “was very contagious and infected some 60 million people in the united states alone within a year,” gupta said. “but it was far less lethal than the flu even — like 1/3 as lethal as the flu.”  TAG1  TAG1 what makes the novel coronavirus different is that “this is both very contagious … and it appears to be far more lethal than the flu as well,” gupta said. “so both those things, in combination i think, are why we’re taking this so seriously.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 do i still need to quarantine for 14 days after returning from travel QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if you traveled internationally, the cdc says you  TAG2 should stay home for 14 days TAG2  after returning home. during those 14 days, be sure to take these steps: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 take your temperature with a thermometer twice a day and monitor for a fever. you can use this  TAG2 temperature log TAG2  to monitor your temperature. and watch for  TAG2 coughing or trouble breathing TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1 “they call that the pre-symptomatic period. so people tend to have more virus at that point seemingly in their nose, in their mouth. this is even before they get sick. and they can be shedding that virus into the environment.” TAG1  TAG1 some people infected with coronavirus never get symptoms. but it’s easy for these asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said dr. anne rimoin, an epidemiology professor at ucla’s school of public health. TAG1  TAG1 “when you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “you’ll rub your nose. you’ll touch your mouth. you’ll rub your eyes. and then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.” TAG1  TAG1 that’s why health officials suggests people  TAG2 wear face masks while in public TAG2  and when it’s difficult to stay 6 feet away from others.

TAG1  TAG1 they compared four types of face masks commonly used by the public: a stitched mask with two layers of fabric, a commercial cone mask, a folded handkerchief, and a bandana. researchers tested each to see which would likely offer the most protection if someone coughed or sneezed. TAG1  TAG1 — with a cone-style mask, the droplets traveled about 8 inches.  TAG1  TAG1 — a folded handkerchief performed worse, with droplets traveling 1 foot, 3 inches.  TAG1  TAG1 — the bandana gave the least amount of protection of the cloth masks tested, with droplets traveling 3 feet.  TAG1  TAG1 — still, any kind of cloth mask is better than none, the researchers found. without any covering, droplets were able to travel 8 feet.  TAG1  TAG1 “people need to know that wearing masks can reduce transmission of the virus by as much as 50%, and those who refuse are putting their lives, their families, their friends, and their communities at risk,” said dr. christopher, director of the university of washington’s institute for health metrics and evaluation.

TAG1  TAG1 “we’re going to have to wear protective masks, we may have to wear plastic gloves,” herbart said. “learning will not be the same as it was prior to march 1. it just won’t be, and we can’t expect it to be.” TAG1  TAG1 but university of arizona president robert c. robbins,  TAG2 who’s also a cardiac surgeon TAG2 , said while he intends to wear a mask and will strongly encourage others to wear masks, he won’t mandate students wear them all day long.

TAG1  TAG1 coronavirus often spreads more easily indoors rather than outdoors — especially  TAG2 if you’re indoors for an extended period of time TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 researchers have also found that heavy breathing and  TAG2 singing TAG2  can propel aerosolized viral particles farther and increase the risk of transmission.  TAG1  TAG1 during one fitness instructor workshop, about 30 participants with no symptoms trained intensely for four hours, according to  TAG2 research published by the cdc TAG2 . eight participants later tested positive, and  TAG2 more than 100 new cases of coronavirus TAG2  were traced back to that fitness workshop. TAG1  TAG1 to help mitigate the risk, many gyms are now limiting capacity. some are providing members with disinfectant sprays to sanitize equipment.  TAG1  TAG1 while health experts have recommended staying 6 feet away from others, it’s smart to keep even more distance than that at the gym.  TAG1  TAG1 “with all the heavy breathing, you may even want to double the usual 6 feet to 12 feet, just to be safe,” cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta said.

TAG1  TAG1 but we do know covid-19 is a  TAG2 highly contagious respiratory illness TAG2  that can spread via saliva, coughs, sneezes, talking or breathing — with or without symptoms of illness. TAG1  TAG1 so three harvard physicians examined the likelihood of getting or giving  TAG2 covid-19 during sex and made several recommendations TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 for partners who haven’t been isolating together, people should wear masks and avoid kissing, the authors write. TAG1  TAG1 in addition to wearing masks, people who have sex with partners outside of their home should also shower before and after; avoid sex acts that involve the oral transmission of bodily fluids; clean up the area afterward with soap or alcohol wipes to reduce their likelihood of infection.

TAG1  TAG1 if you do use a multi-stall public restroom, nouri offers the following tips:  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 use paper towels to dry your hands, not the hand dryer. air dryers can spread viral particles around the room. and paper towels  TAG2 have been shown TAG2  to remove residual viral particles more effectively than air. TAG2  TAG2 don’t use your freshly washed hands to turn off the water with the germ-laden faucet handle. instead, use a paper towel to turn off the water and open the bathroom door. throw away the paper towel immediately afterward. TAG2  TAG2 wear  TAG2 a face mask TAG2 . “masks are one of the most effective ways to stop human-to-human transmission,” nouri said. “if people in a public bathroom are not wearing masks, think twice before going in.”  TAG2  TAG2 if the restroom looks crowded, wait until it clears out, if you can.  “you’re reducing the risk of inhaling aerosolized particles from other people,” nouri said.

TAG1  TAG1 “alcohol is pretty effective at killing germs, but it doesn’t wash away stuff,” said dr. john williams, a virologist at the university of pittsburgh medical center children’s hospital of pittsburgh.

TAG1  TAG1 the researchers cannot say if blood type is a direct cause of the differences in susceptibility. it could be that genetic changes that affect someone’s risk also just happen to be linked with blood type, they said. TAG1  TAG1 the study’s findings, while plausible, may mean very little for the average person, said dr. roy silverstein, a hematologist and chairman of the department of medicine at the medical college of wisconsin. TAG1  TAG1 “the absolute difference in risk is very small,” he said. “the risk reduction may be statistically significant, but it is a small change in actual risk. you never would tell somebody who was type o that they were at smaller risk of infection.” TAG1  TAG1 the bottom line: “all of us are susceptible to this virus,” said dr. maria van kerkhove, technical lead for the world health organization’s covid-19 response.

TAG1  TAG1 but it’s important to act quickly for cpr to be effective.  TAG1  TAG1 “the chance of survival goes down by 10% for every minute without cpr,” said dr. comilla sasson, vice president for science and innovation in emergency cardiovascular care at the american heart association. “it’s a 10-minute window to death in many cases.” TAG1  TAG1 if you’re not certified in cpr, performing chest compressions could also buy more time until help arrives. bystanders should “provide high-quality chest compressions  TAG2 by pushing hard and fast in the middle of the victim’s chest TAG2 , with minimal interruptions,” the american heart association said.

TAG1  TAG1 “the level of dilution that would happen in a pool or an ocean or a large freshwater body would not lead to enough virus to establish an infection. but when you do this, you need to just make sure that we’re maintaining an appropriate physical distance while swimming or sitting in a hot tub.”  TAG1  TAG1 that’s because it’s easy for infected people with no symptoms to spread the virus if they’re within 6 feet from each other. if you have an indoor pool or hot tub,  TAG2 even 6 feet might not be enough TAG2  distance.

TAG1  TAG1 “moreover, spraying porous surfaces, such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways, would be even less effective.” besides, the ground isn’t typically a source of infection, the who said.

TAG1  TAG1 the same applies for anything else you touch that might have coronavirus on it. if you can’t wash your hands immediately, use hand sanitzier or disinfectant.

TAG1  TAG1 touching contaminated hair and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose could increase your risk of infection. “like on the skin, this coronavirus is a transient hitchhiker that can be removed by washing,” aronoff said. TAG1  TAG1 but that doesn’t mean you have to wash the hair on your head multiple times a day, said dermatologist  TAG2 dr. hadley king TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 that’s because “living hair attached to our scalps may be better protected by our natural oils that have some antimicrobial properties and may limit how well microbes can attach to the hair,” she said.  TAG1  TAG1 “if you are going out into areas that could possibly be contaminated with viral particles, then it would be reasonable to wash the hair daily during the pandemic. but it’s not the same as hand washing – the virus infects us through our mucosal surfaces.  if your hair is not falling into your face or you’re not running your fingers through it, then there is less of a risk.” TAG1  TAG1 if your hair does fall into your face, you may want to pull it back to minimize your risk, king said.

TAG1  TAG1 the outer layer of the virus is made up of lipids, aka fat. your goal is to break through that fatty barrier, forcing the virus’ guts to spill out and rendering it dead.

TAG1  TAG1 “you need some soap to dissolve grease. so soap or alcohol are very, very effective against dissolving that greasy liquid coating of the virus.” TAG1  TAG1 by cutting through the greasy barrier, williams said, “it physically inactivates the virus so it can’t bind to and enter human cells anymore.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2 schools/education TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can coronavirus be transferred by people’s shoes QUESTION  how do i protect kids who crawl or play on the floor QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 yes, coronavirus can live on the soles of shoes, but the risk of getting covid-19 from shoes appears to be low. TAG1  TAG1 a  TAG2 report published by the cdc TAG2  highlighted a study from a hospital in wuhan, china, where this coronavirus outbreak began.  TAG1  TAG1 the soles of medical workers’ shoes were swabbed and analyzed, and the study found that the virus was “widely distributed” on floors, computer mice, trash cans and door knobs. but it’s important to note the study was done in a hospital, where the virus was concentrated.  TAG1  TAG1 it’s still possible to pick up coronavirus on the bottoms of your shoes by running errands, but it’s unlikely you’ll get sick from it because people don’t often touch the soles of their shoes and then their faces. because covid-19 is a respiratory disease, the  TAG2 cdc advises wearing a mask while in public TAG2  and washing your hands frequently–  TAG2 the correct way TAG2 .

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 coronavirus can be spread unknowingly for many more days than the flu TAG2 . people with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. but during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. but the incubation period for  TAG2 the flu is much shorter TAG2 , and most people get symptoms within two days of infection. TAG2  TAG2 a vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. but about half of americans don’t get vaccinated,  TAG2 including most children who die from the flu TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1 research by the imperial college in great britain “would suggest you have to institute these kinds of measures for five months, very vigorously,” said dr. celine gounder, an infectious disease specialist at bellevue hospital center.  TAG1  TAG1 “and then you may be able to relax for a period. and then you would re-institute as the cases go up again. but we’re basically looking at doing this over and over and over again, even after a five-month period of strict social distancing, in order to curb cases until we have a vaccine.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 is there a cure QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 there’s currently no cure TAG2  for the novel coronavirus. and while research and trials are underway, it could be next year before a vaccine becomes publicly available. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why is a cure taking so long QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 an antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus’s life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce, according to  TAG2 harvard medical school TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 “in addition, an antiviral drug must be able to kill a virus without killing the human cell it occupies. and viruses are highly adaptive.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why are medical workers getting sick with or dying from coronavirus if they’re wearing protective gear QUESTION  does the viral load matter QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 some have resorted to using  TAG2 plastic report covers TAG2  as masks. the cdc said medical providers might have to  TAG2 use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients TAG2 . (this shortage is why the general public  TAG2 should not buy medical masks TAG2  and instead  TAG2 make cloth masks at home TAG2 .) TAG1  TAG1 but it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. it’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to.  TAG1  TAG1 “the viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician dr. leana wen said. “so that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can i have the flu and coronavirus at the same time QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 yes. testing positive for either the flu or coronavirus doesn’t exempt you from having the other at the same time.  TAG1  TAG1 the flu and coronavirus share some common symptoms, such as fever and cough. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 and recent studies  TAG2 suggest 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers TAG2  don’t have symptoms. TAG1  TAG1 in the us, “i think it could be as many as 1 in 3 walking around asymptomatic,” said new jersey primary care physician dr. alex salerno. TAG1  TAG1 “we have tested some patients that have known exposure to covid (coronavirus disease). they did not have temperature. their pulse/(oxygen) was ok.” TAG1  TAG1 aside from social distancing and frequent hand washing, salerno said more testing of people without symptoms is essential. TAG1  TAG1 when asymptomatic carriers test positive, “we isolate them, and we separate them from the people who are not positive,” salerno said. if more asymptomatic people got tested, “we could get people back to work safely.” TAG1  TAG1 but there haven’t been nearly enough tests in the us for everyone who wants one, due to shortages, delays and  TAG2 faulty test kits TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2 myths &amp; misinformation TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if there’s no cure, why go to the hospital unless you have a breathing problem QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 most coronavirus patients don’t need to be hospitalized. “the vast majority of people – about 80% – will do well without any specific intervention,” said dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. TAG1  TAG1 those patients should get plenty of rest, hydrate frequently and take fever-reducing medication. TAG1  TAG1 “the current guidance – and this may change – is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them,” said  TAG2 dr. patrice harris, president of the american medical association TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 but about 20% of coronavirus patients get advanced disease. “older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,” the  TAG2 cdc TAG2  says. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 persistent pain or pressure in the chest TAG2  TAG2 sudden confusion  TAG2  TAG2 bluish lips or face TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “this list is not all inclusive,” the cdc says. “please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2 family TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why are people stocking up on bottled water QUESTION  is the water supply at risk QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 no, the water supply is not at risk. TAG1  TAG1 “the covid-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water,” the  TAG2 cdc TAG2  says. “conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes covid-19.” TAG1  TAG1 so there’s no need to hoard drinking water, said dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. fauci said he and his wife are still drinking tap water. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2 myths &amp; misinformation TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 we need a babysitter. how do i keep my family safe with someone new in the house QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 the harvard medical school TAG2  offers several tips, including:  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 choosing a babysitter who has minimal exposures to other people besides your family TAG2  TAG2 limiting the number of babysitters. if you can keep it to one, that’s ideal. but if you need multple babysitters, keep the number as low as possible TAG2  TAG2 making sure the babysitter understands he or she needs to practice social distancing and limits physical interaction with your children as much as possible TAG2  TAG2 telling the babysitter that he or she must not come to your house if feeling even the slightest bit sick, or has had known exposure to coronavirus TAG2  TAG2 making sure everyone washes their hands frequently throughout the day, especially before eating. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2 family TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if people can spread the virus without showing any symptoms, how can i tell who’s infected and who’s not QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 you can’t, said dr. james phillips, chief of disaster and operational medicine at george washington university hospital. TAG1  TAG1 “we’re so far behind on testing, there’s only one way we can be certain not to transmit the virus and be certain not to get it ourselves: we need to start treating every person as though they have this, ” phillips said.  TAG1  TAG1 “and everyone needs to treat us like we have it, and socially distance ourselves in that manner. because until we have (enough) testing, we don’t know who has this. and we’re not sure when they start spreading it.”  TAG1  TAG1 that’s why it’s so critical to avoid crowds, stay at least 6 feet away from others, wear a mask when you might be in close contact with others, wash or disinfect your hands, and stop touching your face.

TAG2  TAG2 having only one person serve as the caretaker. TAG2  TAG2 asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. if the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2 family TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what are the symptoms QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 fever, dry cough and difficulty breathing are hallmarks of coronavirus.  TAG1  TAG1 symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks after exposure,  TAG2 the cdc says TAG2 . but some people get no symptoms at all and can infect others without knowing it. TAG1  TAG1 the illness varies in its severity, and many patients can recover at home in isolation. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can coronavirus go through skin and into the body QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “it may be possible that a person can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,”  TAG2 the cdc says TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 more often than not, people get coronavirus through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. TAG1  TAG1 “these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs,” the cdc says. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how long is someone contagious after getting coronavirus QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 it varies. decisions about when a person can be released from isolation are made on a case-by-case basis.  TAG1  TAG1 the centers for disease control and prevention  TAG2 issued guidelines TAG2  for when it is ok to release someone from isolation. they include meeting all of these requirements:   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.   TAG2  TAG2 the patient is no longer showing  TAG2 symptoms, including cough TAG2 .   TAG2  TAG2 the patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others,” the cdc says. TAG1  TAG1 but for asymptomatic carriers who have no symptoms, the timeline is much more difficult to pinpoint. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 no one from my family has been exposed to the virus, and no one is sick. can we get together for a family dinner QUESTION  there are 10 of us, ages 4 to 88. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 it’s virtually impossible to say for sure that you haven’t been exposed to the virus. some carriers of coronavirus don’t have any symptoms. but they can still pass on the virus without knowing it.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 family TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 are kids more at risk QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “younger people, thankfully, seem to be insulated to some extent to protect (them) from getting particularly sick from this,” said cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta. “we don’t know entirely why.” TAG1  TAG1 but while children might have mild to no symptoms with coronavirus, they  TAG2 can still get others sick TAG2 .                “they can still carry the virus in their bodies,” gupta said. “they could potentially still shed the virus and be a source of infection.” TAG1  TAG1 like everyone else, children should wash their hands  TAG2 frequently for at least 20 seconds TAG2 , stay at least 6 feet away from others whenver possible, and stop touching their faces –  TAG2 which is a lot harder than it sounds TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 family TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what can i do if my loved one suspects they have coronavirus QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 don’t visit family members with suspected illness – keep up with them virtually.                if that loved one lives with you, limit contact with them and avoid using the same bathroom or bedroom,  TAG2 the cdc advises TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 if they’ve been diagnosed, they may be able to recover at home in isolation. separate yourself as much as possible from your infected family member and keep animals away, too. continue to use separate restrooms and regularly disinfect them with  TAG2 epa-approved products TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 stock up on groceries and household supplies TAG2  for them while they can’t travel outside and minimize trips to stores. wash your hands frequently and avoid sharing personal items with the infected person. TAG1  TAG1 if you suspect you’re developing symptoms, stay home and call your physician. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 family TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should i disinfect my groceries QUESTION  if so, how QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “i would suggest wiping down external surfaces of canned or wrapped foods,” said dr. celine gounder, an infectious disease specialist at bellevue hospital center.  TAG1  TAG1 “you should be washing your vegetables (and) produce anyway,” she said. “but i think making sure you sanitize your hands, wash your hands after you do all that – after you unpack all your groceries – is also a key step.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 the stores are all out of disinfectant sprays and hand sanitizer. can i make my own QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 yes, you can make both at home. TAG1  TAG1 “unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted” if you’re trying to kill coronavirus on a non-porous surface, the us centers for disease control and prevention said.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the cdc’s recipe TAG2  calls for diluting 5 tablespoons (or ⅓ cup) of bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water.  TAG1  TAG1 you can also make your own hand sanitizer. the nebraska medical center –  TAG2 famous for its biocontainment unit TAG2  and treatment of ebola patients –  TAG2 offers this recipe TAG2 : TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what you’ll need: TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in a mixing bowl, stir isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera gel together until well blended.add 8-10 drops of scented essential oil (optional, but nice). stir.pour the homemade hand sanitizer into an empty container and seal.write “hand sanitizer” on a piece of masking tape and attach to the bottle. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should i stock up on extra food and supplies QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 yes, because a family member may suddenly have to quarantine. just  TAG2 don’t TAG2  TAG2 hoard more than you need TAG2  because other people need supplies, too.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 harvard medical school TAG2  recommends keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. and if you don’t use them now, they may come in handy for power outages or extreme weather.  TAG1  TAG1 it’s also a good idea to keep at least a 30-day supply of prescription medications you may need, though it can be difficult to get them early. consider  TAG2 mail-ordering medications TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should i avoid public transportation QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if you rely on public transportation, use caution. if you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it.  TAG1  TAG1 mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the new york subway system.  TAG1  TAG1 dr. robyn gershon, a professor of epidemiology at new york university’s school of public health,  TAG2 has some tips TAG2 : when you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. use a tissue to hold onto a pole. avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting.  TAG1  TAG1 again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 new york gov. andrew cuomo recommends TAG2  letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. it’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car.  TAG1  TAG1 if you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.

TAG1  TAG1 modern commercial jets recirculate 10-50% of the air in the cabin, mixed with outside air.                 “the recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20-30 times per hour,” the cdc says.  TAG1  TAG1 “furthermore, air generally circulates in defined areas within the aircraft, thus limiting the radius of distribution of pathogens spread by small-particle aerosols. as a result, the cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 travel TAG2  TAG2 work/life TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 i have plans to go on a cruise. should i rebook or cancel QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “us citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship,” the  TAG2 us department of state TAG2  says.

TAG1  TAG1 “people who suffer very severe illness can take months to recover from the illness.” TAG1  TAG1 recovery is often marked by a patient no longer showing symptoms and having two consecutive negative tests at least one day apart, ryan said. but there is  TAG2 no known cure TAG2  for this novel coronavirus. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why waste a test kit on a person without symptoms QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 some people with coronavirus have mild or no symptoms. and in some cases, symptoms don’t appear until  TAG2 up to 14 days after infection TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 during that incubation period, it’s possible to get coronavirus from someone with no symptoms. it’s also possible you may have coronavirus without feeling sick and are accidentally infecting others.  TAG1  TAG1 so anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the  TAG2 us centers for disease control and prevention TAG2  said. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why has the us been so far behind other countries with testing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 experts say it’s due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 problems with public health infrastructure: TAG2  two years ago, the  TAG2 cdc stopped funding epidemic prevention activities TAG2  in 39 countries, including china. this happened because the trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 ebola outbreak.  TAG1  TAG1 former cdc director dr. tom frieden warned that move “would  TAG2 significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread TAG2  without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.” TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 problems with the testing: TAG2  malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown.  TAG1  TAG1 in the first few weeks of the outbreak in the us, the cdc was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a world health organization test became available around the same time.  TAG1  TAG1 some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the us behind about “four to five weeks,” says dr. rob davidson, executive director of the committee to protect medicare. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 if a coronavirus patient progresses to pneumonia, what antibiotics if any have proven to be effective QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 no, antibiotics are not effective against coronavirus because the disease is a viral infection, not a bacterial infection.  TAG1  TAG1 “however, if you are hospitalized for the [coronavirus], you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible,” the  TAG2 world health organization TAG2  says.  TAG1  TAG1 for now, coronavirus patients get “supportive” treatment, “which means giving fluids, medicine to reduce fever, and, in severe cases, supplemental oxygen,” the  TAG2 harvard medical school TAG2  says. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 treatment &amp; prevention TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 did dean koontz predict this outbreak in the book “the eyes of darkness” almost 40 years ago QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 no. there are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel, which says “a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread around the globe” around the year 2020. modern editions of the book call the biological strain “wuhan-400,” and the current coronavirus outbreak started in wuhan, china. TAG1  TAG1 but there are  TAG2 important differences between the book and reality TAG2 . the original version of the book called the strain the “ TAG2 gorki-400 TAG2 ,” in reference to a russian locality, before it was later changed to the “wuhan-400.” in the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the  TAG2 novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans TAG2 . and in the book, the virus had a 100% mortality rate. early estimates of the mortality rate for this coronavirus outbreak range from 2-4%. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 myths &amp; misinformation TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can the heat from a hand dryer kill coronavirus QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 hand dryers can’t kill the virus,  TAG2 according to who TAG2 . the organization also says that uv lamps shouldn’t be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin. TAG1  TAG1 drinking hot water or taking hot baths won’t kill it, either. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 myths &amp; misinformation TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 can i get coronavirus from a package sent from china QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 no. “the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in china or any country reporting covid-19 cases,” the  TAG2 world health organization TAG2  says.  TAG1  TAG1 “even though the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days (depending on the type of surface), it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperatures,” who said.  TAG1  TAG1 the best ways to prevent transmission is to stay 6 feet away from others,  TAG2 wear a face mask TAG2 , stop touching your face, thoroughly wash your hands, and disinfect surfaces with  TAG2 epa-approved products TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 x TAG2  TAG1 overview TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 worldwide spread TAG2  of the new coronavirus led the world health organization (who) to  designate covid-19 as a  TAG2 pandemic TAG2  on march 11, 2020. on march 13, 2020, the president of the united states  declared the covid-19 pandemic a  TAG2 national emergency TAG2 . the latest situation summary updates are available on the cdc's  TAG2 coronavirus webpage TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 there is an ongoing effort to  better understand disease transmissibility, infectivity, and severity associated  with this pandemic.  TAG2 according to the cdc TAG2 : TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 person-to-person  spread most likely occurs during close (within 6 feet) contact with an infected  person. TAG2  TAG2 person-to-person  spread is thought to occur mainly via droplets of respiratory secretions  produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza  and other respiratory diseases spread. these droplets are believed to enter the  mouths and noses of people nearby, and can be inhaled into the nose and lungs. TAG2  TAG2 there  is also growing evidence of  TAG2 transmission risk TAG2  from infected people who are asymptomatic (without symptoms) or before  the onset of recognized symptoms. TAG2  TAG2 covid-19  can also be transmitted by touching surfaces or objects contaminated with sars-cov-2  (the virus that causes the disease), then touching their mouth, nose, or  possibly the eyes. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in  TAG2 many areas TAG2 , the virus that causes covid-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people. this is referred to as community transmission, which means that people in certain areas are being infected with the virus and transmission cannot be traced to a single infected person. infected people may not be sure how, when, or where they became infected. exposure may occur in community, home, and workplace settings. as the pandemic evolves, different parts of the united states are experiencing different levels of covid-19 disease. TAG1  TAG1 risk factors for worker  exposure to sars-cov-2 include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 job duties involving close (within 6 feet) contact with infected people or other sources of the virus. this includes close contact with suspected or confirmed covid-19 patients or their infectious body fluids in the healthcare, postmortem care, and laboratory sectors. TAG2  TAG2 in almost all sectors, job duties involving either sustained close contact (within 6 feet) or frequent close contact with coworkers, customers, and/or members of the general public who may be infected with the virus without knowing it. infected people can spread the virus even if they do not have  TAG2 signs and/or symptoms TAG2  of covid-19. TAG2  TAG2 social conditions conducive to transmission, including in areas of high population density or where people have frequent and/or prolonged close contact, either in the community or in the workplace. this includes situations in which workers live in shared housing or gather in groups, especially without maintaining social distancing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 many workers, even those who do not encounter infectious people in the course of their job duties, can have similar exposure risks as the  TAG2 general american public TAG2  in a pandemic.  exposure risks can increase for workers interacting with individuals with higher risks of contracting covid-19 and for workers who have exposure to other sources of the virus in the course of their job duties. osha has developed guidance for  TAG2 classifying worker exposure risks TAG2  into lower (caution), medium, high, and very high risk categories  and provides guidance and resources for protecting workers who perform job  tasks in each risk level; see the  TAG2 control and  prevention TAG2  page of this safety and health topics page. TAG1  TAG1 in addition to this webpage and other osha guidance, employers and workers should consult  TAG2 interim cdc guidance TAG2  specific to covid-19, including  TAG2 information for businesses TAG2 . cdc also provides tips on  TAG2 what the general public should do TAG2  during the ongoing pandemic.

TAG2  TAG2 [9] TAG2  TAG2  it was first identified in december 2019 in  TAG2 wuhan TAG2 ,  TAG2 hubei TAG2 , china, and has resulted in  TAG2 an ongoing pandemic TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [10] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [11] TAG2  TAG2  the first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 november 2019 in hubei. TAG2  TAG2 [12] TAG2  TAG2  as of 21 july 2020,  TAG2 more than 14.7 TAG2   TAG2 million cases TAG2  have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in  TAG2 more than 609,000 deaths TAG2 . more than 8.29 TAG2   TAG2 million people have recovered. TAG2  TAG2 [8] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and  TAG2 loss of smell TAG2  and  TAG2 taste TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [13] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [5] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [14] TAG2  TAG2  while the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to  TAG2 acute respiratory distress syndrome TAG2  (ards) possibly precipitated by  TAG2 cytokine storm TAG2 , TAG2  TAG2 [15] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 multi-organ failure TAG2 ,  TAG2 septic shock TAG2 , and  TAG2 blood clots TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [16] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [17] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [18] TAG2  TAG2  the  TAG2 time from exposure to onset of symptoms TAG2  is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days. TAG2  TAG2 [5] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [19] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the virus is primarily  TAG2 spread TAG2  between people during close contact, TAG2  TAG2 [a] TAG2  TAG2  most often via  TAG2 small droplets TAG2  produced by coughing, TAG2  TAG2 [b] TAG2  TAG2  sneezing, and talking. TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  the droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than  TAG2 travelling through air over long distances TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [23] TAG2  TAG2  transmission may also occur through  TAG2 smaller droplets TAG2  that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. TAG2  TAG2 [24] TAG2  TAG2  less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  it is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms. TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  the standard method of  TAG2 diagnosis TAG2  is by  TAG2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction TAG2  (rrt-pcr) from a  TAG2 nasopharyngeal swab TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [25] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 chest ct TAG2  imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using ct imaging for routine screening. TAG2  TAG2 [26] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [27] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent  TAG2 hand washing TAG2 ,  TAG2 maintaining physical distance from others TAG2  (especially from those with symptoms),  TAG2 quarantine TAG2  (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. TAG2  TAG2 [7] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [28] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [29] TAG2  TAG2  the use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a  TAG2 bandana TAG2  has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use. TAG2  TAG2 [30] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [31] TAG2  TAG2  health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as  TAG2 n95 masks TAG2 , should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals. TAG2  TAG2 [32] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [33] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 11–35% TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 symptoms of covid-19. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 fever TAG2  is the most common symptom of covid-19, TAG2  TAG2 [13] TAG2  TAG2  but is highly variable in severity and presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically ill people not having fever at all. TAG2  TAG2 [39] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [40] TAG2  TAG2  in one study, only 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization. TAG2  TAG2 [41] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 other common symptoms include cough,  TAG2 loss of appetite TAG2 , fatigue,  TAG2 shortness of breath TAG2 ,  TAG2 sputum production TAG2 , and  TAG2 muscle TAG2  and  TAG2 joint pains TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [13] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [1] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [5] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [42] TAG2  TAG2  symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages. TAG2  TAG2 [43] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [44] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [45] TAG2  TAG2  less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions. TAG2  TAG2 [46] TAG2  TAG2  some cases in china initially presented with only  TAG2 chest tightness TAG2  and  TAG2 palpitations TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [47] TAG2  TAG2  a decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur. TAG2  TAG2 [48] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [49] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 loss of smell TAG2  was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in south korea. TAG2  TAG2 [14] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [50] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 as is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. this is called the  TAG2 incubation period TAG2 . the typical incubation period for covid‑19 is five or six days, but it can range from one to fourteen days TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [51] TAG2  TAG2  with approximately ten percent of cases taking longer. TAG2  TAG2 [52] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [53] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [54] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 an early key to the diagnosis is the tempo of the illness. early symptoms may include a wide variety of symptoms but infrequently involves shortness of breath. shortness of breath usually develops several days after initial symptoms. shortness of breath that begins immediately along with fever and cough is more likely to be anxiety than covid-19. the most critical days of illness tend to be those following the development of shortness of breath. TAG2  TAG2 [55] TAG2  TAG2 a minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time. TAG2  TAG2 [56] TAG2  TAG2  these  TAG2 asymptomatic TAG2  carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not fully known. TAG2  TAG2 [57] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [58] TAG2  TAG2  preliminary evidence suggested they may contribute to the spread of the disease. TAG2  TAG2 [59] TAG2  TAG2  in june 2020, a spokeswoman of who said that asymptomatic transmission appears to be &quot;rare,&quot; but the evidence for the claim was not released. TAG2  TAG2 [60] TAG2  TAG2  the next day, who clarified that they had intended a narrow definition of &quot;asymptomatic&quot; that did not include pre-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic (weak symptoms) transmission and that up to 41% of transmission may be asymptomatic. transmission without symptoms does occur. TAG2  TAG2 [56] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cause TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 transmission TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 respiratory droplets produced when a man  TAG2 sneezes TAG2 , visualised using  TAG2 tyndall scattering TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 covid‑19 is a new disease, and many of the details of its  TAG2 spread TAG2  are still under investigation. TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  it spreads easily between people—easier than  TAG2 influenza TAG2  but not as easily as  TAG2 measles TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  people are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission). TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  they remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases. TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  people can also transmit the virus without showing any symptom ( TAG2 asymptomatic TAG2  transmission), but it is unclear how often this happens. TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  a june 2020 review found that 40–45% of infected people are asymptomatic. TAG2  TAG2 [61] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 covid-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales  TAG2 small droplets TAG2  produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing. TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [62] TAG2  TAG2  the who recommends 1 metre (3 ft) of social distance; TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  the us  TAG2 centers for disease control and prevention TAG2  (cdc) recommends 2 metres (6 ft). TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 transmission may also occur through  TAG2 aerosols TAG2 , smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. TAG2  TAG2 [24] TAG2  TAG2   experimental results show the virus can survive in aerosol up to three hours. TAG2  TAG2 [63] TAG2  TAG2  some outbreaks have also been reported in crowded and inadequately ventilated indoor locations where infected persons spend long periods of time (such as restaurants and nightclubs). TAG2  TAG2 [64] TAG2  TAG2  aerosol transmission in such locations has not been ruled out. TAG2  TAG2 [24] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 some medical procedures TAG2  performed on covid-19 patients in health facilities can generate those smaller droplets, TAG2  TAG2 [65] TAG2  TAG2  and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal. TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 when the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can, though less commonly, remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  on surfaces the amount of viable active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection, TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads. TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  it is unknown what amount of virus on surfaces is required to cause infection via this method, but it can be detected for up to four hours on copper, up to one day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic ( TAG2 polypropylene TAG2 ) and  TAG2 stainless steel TAG2  ( TAG2 aisi 304 TAG2 ). TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [66] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [67] TAG2  TAG2  surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which destroy the virus outside the human body or on the hands. TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for covid‑19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as when used inside the human body. TAG2  TAG2 [68] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 sputum TAG2  and  TAG2 saliva TAG2  carry large amounts of virus.

TAG2  TAG2 [75] TAG2  TAG2  all features of the novel sars-cov-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature. TAG2  TAG2 [76] TAG2  TAG2 outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its  TAG2 protective bubble TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [26] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 sars-cov-2 is closely related to the original  TAG2 sars-cov TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [77] TAG2  TAG2  it is thought to have an animal ( TAG2 zoonotic TAG2 ) origin. genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus  TAG2  TAG2 betacoronavirus TAG2  TAG2 , in subgenus  TAG2  TAG2 sarbecovirus TAG2  TAG2  (lineage b) together with two  TAG2 bat TAG2 -derived strains. it is 96% identical at the whole  TAG2 genome TAG2  level to other bat coronavirus samples (batcov ratg13). TAG2  TAG2 [46] TAG2  TAG2  in february 2020, chinese researchers found that there is only one  TAG2 amino acid TAG2  difference in the binding domain of the  TAG2 s protein TAG2  between the coronaviruses from  TAG2 pangolins TAG2  and those from humans; however, whole-genome comparison to date TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 when QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  found that at most 92% of genetic material was shared between pangolin coronavirus and  TAG2 sars-cov-2 TAG2 , which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the  TAG2 intermediate host TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [78] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 pathophysiology TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the lungs are the organs most affected by covid‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme  TAG2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 TAG2  (ace2), which is most abundant in  TAG2 type ii alveolar cells TAG2  of the lungs. TAG2  TAG2 [79] TAG2  TAG2  the virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a &quot;spike&quot; ( TAG2 peplomer TAG2 ) to connect to ace2 and enter the host cell. TAG2  TAG2 [80] TAG2  TAG2  the density of ace2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested decreasing ace2 activity might be protective, TAG2  TAG2 [81] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [82] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 unreliable medical source QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  though another view is that increasing ace2 using  TAG2 angiotensin ii receptor blocker TAG2  medications could be protective. TAG2  TAG2 [83] TAG2  TAG2  as the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow. TAG2  TAG2 [82] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 unreliable medical source QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 sars-cov-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brainstem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the  TAG2 central nervous system (cns) TAG2 . while virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the cns remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ace2 in the brain.

TAG2  TAG2 [98] TAG2  TAG2  the standard method of testing is  TAG2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction TAG2  (rrt-pcr). TAG2  TAG2 [99] TAG2  TAG2  the test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a  TAG2 nasopharyngeal swab TAG2 ; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used. TAG2  TAG2 [25] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [100] TAG2  TAG2  results are generally available within a few hours to two days. TAG2  TAG2 [101] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [102] TAG2  TAG2  blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value. TAG2  TAG2 [103] TAG2  TAG2  chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the  TAG2 genetic sequence TAG2  so laboratories across the world could independently develop  TAG2 polymerase chain reaction TAG2  (pcr) tests to detect infection by the virus. TAG2  TAG2 [10] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [104] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [105] TAG2  TAG2  as of 4 april 2020 TAG2  TAG2 [update] TAG2  TAG2 ,  TAG2 antibody tests TAG2  (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used. TAG2  TAG2 [106] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [107] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [108] TAG2  TAG2  antibody tests may be most accurate 2–3 weeks after a person's symptoms start. TAG2  TAG2 [109] TAG2  TAG2  the chinese experience with testing has shown the  TAG2 accuracy TAG2  is only 60 to 70%. TAG2  TAG2 [110] TAG2  TAG2  the us  TAG2 food and drug administration TAG2  (fda) approved the first  TAG2 point-of-care test TAG2  on 21 march 2020 for use at the end of that month. TAG2  TAG2 [111] TAG2  TAG2  the absence or presence of covid-19 signs and symptoms alone is not reliable enough for an accurate diagnosis. TAG2  TAG2 [112] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 diagnostic guidelines released by zhongnan hospital of  TAG2 wuhan university TAG2  suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk. these involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced  TAG2 lymphocyte TAG2  count. TAG2  TAG2 [113] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a study asked hospitalised covid‑19 patients to cough into a sterile container, thus producing a saliva sample, and detected the virus in eleven of twelve patients using rt-pcr. this technique has the potential of being quicker than a swab and involving less risk to health care workers (collection at home or in the car). TAG2  TAG2 [69] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 along with laboratory testing, chest ct scans may be helpful to diagnose covid‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening. TAG2  TAG2 [26] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [27] TAG2  TAG2  bilateral multilobar  TAG2 ground-glass opacities TAG2  with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection. TAG2  TAG2 [26] TAG2  TAG2  subpleural dominance,  TAG2 crazy paving TAG2  (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and  TAG2 consolidation TAG2  may appear as the disease progresses.

TAG2  TAG2 [127] TAG2  TAG2  the us  TAG2 national institutes of health TAG2  guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of covid‑19, before or after exposure to the sars-cov-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial. TAG2  TAG2 [128] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [129] TAG2  TAG2  without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing covid‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as &quot;flattening the  TAG2 curve TAG2 &quot;. TAG2  TAG2 [123] TAG2  TAG2  this is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available. TAG2  TAG2 [123] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [126] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.

TAG2  TAG2 [225] TAG2  TAG2  current evidence stemming from meta - analysis of several smaller research papers, also suggest that  TAG2 smoking TAG2  can be assosiated with worse patient outcomes  TAG2  TAG2 [226] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [227] TAG2  TAG2  when someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with covid-19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. TAG2  TAG2 [228] TAG2  TAG2  covid-19 also poses a greater risk to people who  TAG2 misuse opioids TAG2  and  TAG2 methamphetamines TAG2 , insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage. TAG2  TAG2 [229] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 complications and long-term effects TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 complications may include  TAG2 pneumonia TAG2 ,  TAG2 acute respiratory distress syndrome TAG2  (ards),  TAG2 multi-organ failure TAG2 ,  TAG2 septic shock TAG2 , and death. TAG2  TAG2 [10] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [16] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [230] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [231] TAG2  TAG2  cardiovascular complications may include  TAG2 heart failure TAG2 ,  TAG2 arrhythmias TAG2 ,  TAG2 heart inflammation TAG2 , and  TAG2 blood clots TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [232] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 approximately 20–30% of people who present with covid‑19 have  TAG2 elevated liver enzymes TAG2  reflecting liver injury. TAG2  TAG2 [233] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [129] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 neurologic manifestations include  TAG2 seizure TAG2 ,  TAG2 stroke TAG2 ,  TAG2 encephalitis TAG2 , and  TAG2 guillain–barré syndrome TAG2  (which includes  TAG2 loss of motor functions TAG2 ). TAG2  TAG2 [234] TAG2  TAG2  following the infection, children may develop  TAG2 paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome TAG2 , which has symptoms similar to  TAG2 kawasaki disease TAG2 , which can be fatal. TAG2  TAG2 [235] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [236] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 concerns have been raised about long-term  TAG2 sequelae TAG2  of the disease. the  TAG2 hong kong hospital authority TAG2  found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage. TAG2  TAG2 [237] TAG2  TAG2  this may also lead to  TAG2 post-intensive care syndrome TAG2  following recovery. TAG2  TAG2 [238] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 immunity TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 it is unknown (as of april 2020) if past infection provides effective and long-term  TAG2 immunity TAG2  in people who recover from the disease. TAG2  TAG2 [239] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [240] TAG2  TAG2  some of the infected have been reported to develop  TAG2 protective antibodies TAG2 , so  TAG2 acquired immunity TAG2  is presumed likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses. TAG2  TAG2 [241] TAG2  TAG2  cases in which recovery from covid‑19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported. TAG2  TAG2 [242] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [243] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [244] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [245] TAG2  TAG2  however, these cases are believed to be lingering infection rather than reinfection, TAG2  TAG2 [245] TAG2  TAG2  or  TAG2 false positives TAG2  due to remaining rna fragments. TAG2  TAG2 [246] TAG2  TAG2  an investigation by the  TAG2 korean cdc TAG2  of 285 individuals who tested positive for sars-cov-2 in pcr tests administered days or weeks after recovery from covid-19 found no evidence that these individuals were contagious at this later time. TAG2  TAG2 [247] TAG2  TAG2  some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year. TAG2  TAG2 [248] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [249] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 history TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 timeline of the covid-19 pandemic TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the virus is thought to be natural and has an  TAG2 animal origin TAG2 , TAG2  TAG2 [76] TAG2  TAG2  through  TAG2 spillover infection TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [250] TAG2  TAG2  the first known human infections were in china. a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed covid‑19, published in january 2020 in  TAG2  TAG2 the lancet TAG2  TAG2 , reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 TAG2   TAG2 december 2019. TAG2  TAG2 [251] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [252] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [253] TAG2  TAG2  official publications from the who reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 TAG2   TAG2 december 2019. TAG2  TAG2 [254] TAG2  TAG2  human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the who and chinese authorities by 20 january 2020. TAG2  TAG2 [255] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [256] TAG2  TAG2  according to official chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the  TAG2 huanan seafood wholesale market TAG2 , which also sold live animals. TAG2  TAG2 [257] TAG2  TAG2  in may 2020,  TAG2 george gao TAG2 , the director of the  TAG2 chinese center for disease control and prevention TAG2 , said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early  TAG2 superspreading event TAG2 , but it was not the site of the initial outbreak. TAG2  TAG2 [258] TAG2  TAG2  traces of the virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from  TAG2 milan TAG2  and  TAG2 turin TAG2 , italy, on 18 december 2019. TAG2  TAG2 [259] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there are several theories about where the very first case (the so-called  TAG2 patient zero TAG2 ) originated. TAG2  TAG2 [260] TAG2  TAG2  according to an unpublicised report from the chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 november 2019; the person was a 55-year old citizen in the hubei province. there were four men and five women reported to be infected in november, but none of them were &quot;patient zero&quot;. TAG2  TAG2 [12] TAG2  TAG2  by december 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission. TAG2  TAG2 [161] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [261] TAG2  TAG2  the number of coronavirus cases in hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 december TAG2  TAG2 [262] TAG2  TAG2  and at least 266 by 31 december. TAG2  TAG2 [263] TAG2  TAG2  on 24 december,  TAG2 wuhan central hospital TAG2  sent a  TAG2 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid TAG2  (bal) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company vision medicals. on 27 and 28 december, vision medicals informed the wuhan central hospital and the chinese cdc of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. TAG2  TAG2 [264] TAG2  TAG2  a pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 december and treated by the doctor zhang jixian in hubei provincial hospital, who informed the wuhan jianghan cdc on 27 december. TAG2  TAG2 [265] TAG2  TAG2  on 30 december, a test report addressed to wuhan central hospital, from company capitalbio medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for  TAG2 sars TAG2 , causing a group of doctors at wuhan central hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. that evening, the wuhan municipal health commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on &quot;the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause&quot;. TAG2  TAG2 [266] TAG2  TAG2  eight of these doctors, including  TAG2 li wenliang TAG2  (punished on 3 TAG2   TAG2 january), TAG2  TAG2 [267] TAG2  TAG2  were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another,  TAG2 ai fen TAG2 , was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm. TAG2  TAG2 [268] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the wuhan municipal health commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 december, confirming 27 cases TAG2  TAG2 [269] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [270] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [271] TAG2  TAG2 —enough to trigger an investigation. TAG2  TAG2 [272] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 during the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days. TAG2  TAG2 [273] TAG2  TAG2  in early and mid-january 2020, the virus spread to other  TAG2 chinese provinces TAG2 , helped by the  TAG2 chinese new year migration TAG2  and wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange. TAG2  TAG2 [274] TAG2  TAG2  on 20 january, china reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in beijing and one in  TAG2 shenzhen TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [275] TAG2  TAG2  later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, TAG2  TAG2 [276] TAG2  TAG2  and more may have been infected. TAG2  TAG2 [277] TAG2  TAG2  a report in  TAG2  TAG2 the lancet TAG2  TAG2  on 24 january indicated human transmission, strongly recommended  TAG2 personal protective equipment TAG2  for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its &quot;pandemic potential&quot;. TAG2  TAG2 [278] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [279] TAG2  TAG2  on 30 january, the who declared the coronavirus a  TAG2 public health emergency of international concern TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [277] TAG2  TAG2  by this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times. TAG2  TAG2 [280] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 on 31 january 2020, italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from china. TAG2  TAG2 [281] TAG2  TAG2  as of 13 march 2020, the who considered europe the active centre of the pandemic. TAG2  TAG2 [282] TAG2  TAG2  on 19 march 2020, italy overtook china as the country with the most deaths. TAG2  TAG2 [283] TAG2  TAG2  by 26 march, the united states had overtaken china and italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. TAG2  TAG2 [284] TAG2  TAG2  research on  TAG2 coronavirus genomes TAG2  indicates the majority of covid-19 cases in  TAG2 new york TAG2  came from european travellers, rather than directly from china or any other asian country. TAG2  TAG2 [285] TAG2  TAG2  retesting of prior samples found a person in france who had the virus on 27 december 2019 TAG2  TAG2 [286] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [287] TAG2  TAG2  and a person in the united states who died from the disease on 6 TAG2   TAG2 february 2020. TAG2  TAG2 [288] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 on 11 june 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case, TAG2  TAG2 [289] TAG2  TAG2  beijing reported the first covid-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 june. TAG2  TAG2 [290] TAG2  TAG2  by 15 june, 79 cases were officially confirmed. TAG2  TAG2 [291] TAG2  TAG2  most of these patients went to  TAG2 xinfadi wholesale market TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [289] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [292] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 epidemiology TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 main articles:  TAG2 covid-19 pandemic TAG2  and  TAG2 covid-19 pandemic death rates by country TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality. TAG2  TAG2 [293] TAG2  TAG2  these numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. TAG2  TAG2 [294] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. based on johns hopkins university statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.1% (609,986/14,707,451) as of 21 july 2020. TAG2  TAG2 [8] TAG2  TAG2  the number varies by region. TAG2  TAG2 [295] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 other measures include the  TAG2 case fatality rate TAG2  (cfr), which reflects the percent of  TAG2 diagnosed TAG2  individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (ifr), which reflects the percent of  TAG2 infected TAG2  individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. these statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations. TAG2  TAG2 [296] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing. TAG2  TAG2 [297] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [298] TAG2  TAG2  in the united states, the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from covid‑19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare. TAG2  TAG2 [297] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 total confirmed cases over time TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 total deaths over time TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 total confirmed cases of covid‑19 per million people TAG2  TAG2 [299] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 total confirmed deaths due to covid‑19 per million people TAG2  TAG2 [300] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 infection fatality rate TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 infection fatality rate (or infection fatality ratio) is distinguished from  TAG2 case fatality rate TAG2 . the case fatality rate (&quot;cfr&quot;) for a disease is the proportion of deaths from the disease compared to the total number of people  TAG2 diagnosed TAG2  with the disease (within a certain period of time). the infection fatality ratio (&quot;ifr&quot;), in contrast, is the proportion of deaths among all the  TAG2 infected TAG2  individuals. ifr, unlike cfr, attempts to account for all asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 our world in data TAG2  states that, as of 25 march 2020, the  TAG2 infection fatality rate TAG2  (ifr) for coronavirus cannot be accurately calculated. TAG2  TAG2 [301] TAG2  TAG2  in february, the world health organization reported estimates of ifr between 0.33% and 1%. TAG2  TAG2 [302] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [303] TAG2  TAG2  on 2 july, the who's chief scientist reported that the average ifr estimate presented at a two-day who expert forum was about 0.6%. TAG2  TAG2 [304] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [305] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the cdc estimates for planning purposes that the infection fatality rate is 0.65% and that 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, suggesting a fatality rate among those who are symptomatic of 1.08% (.65/60) (as of 10 july). TAG2  TAG2 [306] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [307] TAG2  TAG2  according to the  TAG2 university of oxford TAG2  TAG2 centre for evidence-based medicine TAG2  (cebm), random antibody testing in germany suggested a national ifr of 0.37% (0.12% to 0.87%). TAG2  TAG2 [308] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [309] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [310] TAG2  TAG2  to get a better view on the number of people infected, as of april 2020 TAG2  TAG2 [update] TAG2  TAG2 , initial antibody testing had been carried out, but peer-reviewed scientific analyses had not yet been published. TAG2  TAG2 [311] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [312] TAG2  TAG2  on 1 TAG2   TAG2 may antibody testing in new york city suggested an ifr of 0.86%. TAG2  TAG2 [313] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 firm lower limits of infection fatality rates have been established in a number of locations such as new york city and bergamo in italy since the ifr cannot be less than the population fatality rate. as of 10 TAG2   TAG2 july, in  TAG2 new york city TAG2 , with a population of 8.4 TAG2   TAG2 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with covid-19 (0.28% of the population). TAG2  TAG2 [314] TAG2  TAG2  in  TAG2 bergamo TAG2  province, 0.57% of the population has died. TAG2  TAG2 [315] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 sex differences TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 gendered impact of the covid-19 pandemic TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 early reviews of epidemiologic data showed greater impact of the pandemic and a higher mortality rate in men in china and italy. TAG2  TAG2 [316] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [1] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [317] TAG2  TAG2  the  TAG2 chinese center for disease control and prevention TAG2  reported the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women. TAG2  TAG2 [318] TAG2  TAG2  later reviews in june 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in cfr between genders. TAG2  TAG2 [319] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [320] TAG2  TAG2  one review acknowledges the different mortality rates in chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors. TAG2  TAG2 [321] TAG2  TAG2  sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men. TAG2  TAG2 [322] TAG2  TAG2  in europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with covid-19 were men. TAG2  TAG2 [323] TAG2  TAG2  as of april 2020, the us government is not tracking sex-related data of covid-19 infections. TAG2  TAG2 [324] TAG2  TAG2  research has shown that viral illnesses like ebola, hiv, influenza and sars affect men and women differently. TAG2  TAG2 [324] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 estimated prognosis by age and sex based on cases from  TAG2 france TAG2  and  TAG2 diamond princess ship TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [325] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 percent of infected people who are hospitalized TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 0–19 TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 numbers in parentheses are 95%  TAG2 credible intervals TAG2  for the estimates. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 ethnic differences TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in the us, a greater proportion of deaths due to covid-19 have occurred among  TAG2 african americans TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [326] TAG2  TAG2  structural factors that prevent african americans from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in &quot;essential&quot; occupations such as public transit and health care. greater prevalence of lacking  TAG2 health insurance TAG2  and care and of underlying conditions such as  TAG2 diabetes TAG2 ,  TAG2 hypertension TAG2  and  TAG2 heart disease TAG2  also increase their risk of death. TAG2  TAG2 [327] TAG2  TAG2  similar issues affect  TAG2 native american TAG2  and  TAG2 latino TAG2  communities. TAG2  TAG2 [326] TAG2  TAG2  according to a us health policy non-profit, 34% of american indian and alaska native people (aian) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults. TAG2  TAG2 [328] TAG2  TAG2  the source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water. TAG2  TAG2 [329] TAG2  TAG2  leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities. TAG2  TAG2 [330] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in the u.k., a greater proportion of deaths due to covid-19 have occurred in those of a  TAG2 black TAG2 ,  TAG2 asian TAG2 , and other ethnic minority background. TAG2  TAG2 [331] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [332] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [333] TAG2  TAG2  several factors such as poverty, poor nutrition and living in overcrowded properties, may have caused this.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 during the initial outbreak in wuhan, china, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as &quot;coronavirus&quot; and &quot;wuhan coronavirus&quot;, TAG2  TAG2 [334] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [335] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [336] TAG2  TAG2  with the disease sometimes called &quot;wuhan pneumonia&quot;. TAG2  TAG2 [337] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [338] TAG2  TAG2  in the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the  TAG2 spanish flu TAG2 , TAG2  TAG2 [339] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 middle east respiratory syndrome TAG2 , and  TAG2 zika virus TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [340] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in january 2020, the  TAG2 world health organisation TAG2  recommended 2019-ncov TAG2  TAG2 [341] TAG2  TAG2  and 2019-ncov acute respiratory disease TAG2  TAG2 [342] TAG2  TAG2  as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. wuhan, china), animal species or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent  TAG2 social stigma TAG2 .

TAG2  TAG2 [351] TAG2  TAG2  the head of cardiology at the  TAG2 university of arizona TAG2  said, &quot;my worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital.&quot; TAG2  TAG2 [352] TAG2  TAG2  there is also concern that people with  TAG2 strokes TAG2  and  TAG2 appendicitis TAG2  are not seeking timely treatment. TAG2  TAG2 [352] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 shortages TAG2  of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions. TAG2  TAG2 [353] TAG2  TAG2  in several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of  TAG2 sexually transmitted infections TAG2 , including  TAG2 hiv TAG2 , attributable to covid-19 quarantines and social distancing measures. TAG2  TAG2 [354] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [355] TAG2  TAG2  similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of  TAG2 influenza TAG2  and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic. TAG2  TAG2 [356] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [357] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [358] TAG2  TAG2  the pandemic has also  TAG2 negatively impacted mental health TAG2  globally, including increased  TAG2 loneliness TAG2  resulting from social distancing. TAG2  TAG2 [359] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 other animals TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals. a domestic cat in  TAG2 liège TAG2 , belgium, tested positive after it started showing symptoms (diarrhoea, vomiting, shortness of breath) a week later than its owner, who was also positive. TAG2  TAG2 [360] TAG2  TAG2  tigers and lions at the  TAG2 bronx zoo TAG2  in new york, united states, tested positive for the virus and showed symptoms of covid‑19, including a dry cough and loss of appetite. TAG2  TAG2 [361] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 minks TAG2  at two farms in the netherlands also tested positive for covid-19. TAG2  TAG2 [362] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a study on domesticated animals inoculated with the virus found that cats and  TAG2 ferrets TAG2  appear to be &quot;highly susceptible&quot; to the disease, while dogs appear to be less susceptible, with lower levels of viral replication. the study failed to find evidence of viral replication in  TAG2 pigs TAG2 ,  TAG2 ducks TAG2 , and  TAG2 chickens TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [363] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in march 2020, researchers from the  TAG2 university of hong kong TAG2  have shown that  TAG2 syrian hamsters TAG2  could be a  TAG2 model organism TAG2  for covid-19 research.

TAG2  TAG2 [365] TAG2  TAG2  international research on vaccines and medicines in covid‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers. TAG2  TAG2 [366] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [367] TAG2  TAG2  in march, the world health organisation initiated the &quot; TAG2 solidarity trial TAG2 &quot; to assess the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy. TAG2  TAG2 [368] TAG2  TAG2  the world health organization suspended hydroxychloroquine from its global drug trials for covid-19 treatments on 26 may 2020 due to safety concerns. it had previously enrolled 3,500 patients from 17 countries in the solidarity trial. TAG2  TAG2 [369] TAG2  TAG2  france, italy and belgium also banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a covid-19 treatment. TAG2  TAG2 [370] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there has been a great deal of covid-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand. to minimise the harm from  TAG2 misinformation TAG2 , medical professionals and the public are advised to expect rapid changes to available information, and to be attentive to  TAG2 retractions TAG2  and other updates. TAG2  TAG2 [371] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 vaccine TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 covid-19 vaccine TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 there is no available vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates. previous work on  TAG2 sars-cov TAG2  is being used because both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 use the ace2 receptor to enter human cells. TAG2  TAG2 [372] TAG2  TAG2  six vaccination strategies are being investigated. four of these, as of early july 2020, are being tested in clinical trials. TAG2  TAG2 [373] TAG2  TAG2  first, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. the use of such  TAG2 inactive TAG2  virus aims to elicit a prompt  TAG2 immune response TAG2  of the human body to a new infection with covid‑19. a second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. in the case of sars-cov-2, such research focuses on the s-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the  TAG2 ace2 enzyme TAG2  receptor. a third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ( TAG2 dna TAG2  or  TAG2 rna vaccines TAG2 , a novel technique for creating a vaccination). fourthly, scientists are attempting to use viral vectors to deliver the sars-cov-2 antigen gene into the cell. TAG2  TAG2 [374] TAG2  TAG2  these can be replicating or non-replicating. as of early july 2020, only non-replicating viral vectors are in clinical trials. viral vectors in clinical trials include  TAG2 chimpanzee adenovirus 63 TAG2 , TAG2  TAG2 [374] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 adenovirus type-5 TAG2 , TAG2  TAG2 [373] TAG2  TAG2  and  TAG2 adenovirus type-26 TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [375] TAG2  TAG2  scientists are also working to develop an  TAG2 attenuated TAG2  covid-19 vaccine and a covid-19 vaccine using  TAG2 virus-like particles TAG2 , but these are still in preclinical research. TAG2  TAG2 [373] TAG2  TAG2  experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy. TAG2  TAG2 [376] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 antibody-dependent enhancement TAG2  has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for sars-cov-2, but this is controversial. TAG2  TAG2 [377] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 medications TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 covid-19 drug repurposing research TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 at least 29 phase ii–iv efficacy trials in covid‑19 were concluded in march 2020, or scheduled to provide results in april from hospitals in china. TAG2  TAG2 [378] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [379] TAG2  TAG2  there are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of april 2020. TAG2  TAG2 [129] TAG2  TAG2  seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments, including four studies on  TAG2 hydroxychloroquine TAG2  or  TAG2 chloroquine TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [379] TAG2  TAG2  repurposed  TAG2 antiviral drugs TAG2  make up most of the research, with nine phase iii trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of april. TAG2  TAG2 [378] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [379] TAG2  TAG2  other candidates in trials include  TAG2 vasodilators TAG2 ,  TAG2 corticosteroids TAG2 ,  TAG2 immune therapies TAG2 ,  TAG2 lipoic acid TAG2 ,  TAG2 bevacizumab TAG2 , and  TAG2 recombinant TAG2  TAG2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [379] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the covid‑19 clinical research coalition has goals to 1) facilitate rapid reviews of clinical trial proposals by  TAG2 ethics committees TAG2  and national regulatory agencies, 2) fast-track approvals for the candidate therapeutic compounds, 3) ensure standardised and rapid analysis of emerging efficacy and safety data and 4) facilitate sharing of clinical trial outcomes before publication. TAG2  TAG2 [380] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [381] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 several existing medications are being evaluated for the treatment of covid‑19, TAG2  TAG2 [365] TAG2  TAG2  including  TAG2 remdesivir TAG2 ,  TAG2 chloroquine TAG2 ,  TAG2 hydroxychloroquine TAG2 ,  TAG2 lopinavir/ritonavir TAG2 , and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with  TAG2 interferon beta TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [368] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [382] TAG2  TAG2  there is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, and on 1 may 2020, the united states  TAG2 food and drug administration TAG2  (fda) gave the drug an  TAG2 emergency use authorization TAG2  for people hospitalized with severe covid‑19. TAG2  TAG2 [383] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 phase iii clinical trials TAG2  for several drugs are underway in several countries, including the us, china, and italy. TAG2  TAG2 [365] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [378] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [384] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there are mixed results as of 3 april 2020 as to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covid‑19, with some studies showing little or no improvement. TAG2  TAG2 [385] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [386] TAG2  TAG2  one study has shown an association between hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use with higher death rates along with other side effects. TAG2  TAG2 [387] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [388] TAG2  TAG2  a retraction of this study by its authors was published by  TAG2 the lancet TAG2  on 4 june 2020. TAG2  TAG2 [389] TAG2  TAG2  the studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without  TAG2 azithromycin TAG2  have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study. TAG2  TAG2 [129] TAG2  TAG2  on 15 june 2020, the fda updated the fact sheets for the emergency use authorization of remdesivir to warn that using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with remdesivir may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir. TAG2  TAG2 [390] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in june, initial results from a  TAG2 randomised trial TAG2  in the united kingdom showed that  TAG2 dexamethasone TAG2  reduced mortality by one third for patients who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen. TAG2  TAG2 [391] TAG2  TAG2  because this is a well tested and widely available treatment this was welcomed by the who that is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other steroids. TAG2  TAG2 [392] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [393] TAG2  TAG2  based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the  TAG2 national institutes of health TAG2  for patients with covid-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with covid-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen. TAG2  TAG2 [394] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cytokine storm TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a  TAG2 cytokine storm TAG2  can be a complication in the later stages of severe covid‑19. there is preliminary evidence that  TAG2 hydroxychloroquine TAG2  may be useful in controlling cytokine storms in late-phase severe forms of the disease. TAG2  TAG2 [395] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 tocilizumab TAG2  has been included in treatment guidelines by china's  TAG2 national health commission TAG2  after a small study was completed. TAG2  TAG2 [396] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [397] TAG2  TAG2  it is undergoing a  TAG2 phase TAG2   TAG2 2 TAG2  non-randomised trial at the national level in italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease. TAG2  TAG2 [398] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [399] TAG2  TAG2  combined with a  TAG2 serum ferritin blood test TAG2  to identify a  TAG2 cytokine storm TAG2  (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with  TAG2 cytokine release syndrome TAG2 ), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. TAG2  TAG2 [400] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [401] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [402] TAG2  TAG2  the  TAG2 interleukin-6 TAG2  TAG2 receptor antagonist TAG2  was approved by the  TAG2 food and drug administration TAG2  (fda) to undergo a phase iii clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on covid‑19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause,  TAG2 car t cell TAG2  TAG2 therapy TAG2 , in 2017. TAG2  TAG2 [403] TAG2  TAG2  to date, TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 when QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for crs. prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum il-6 levels by saturating the il-6r, driving il-6 across the  TAG2 blood-brain barrier TAG2 , and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of crs. TAG2  TAG2 [404] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 lenzilumab TAG2 , an anti-gm-csf  TAG2 monoclonal antibody TAG2 , is protective in murine models for car t cell-induced crs and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic gm-csf secreting t-cells in hospitalised patients with covid‑19. TAG2  TAG2 [405] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2 feinstein institute TAG2  of  TAG2 northwell health TAG2  announced in march a study on &quot;a human antibody that may prevent the activity&quot; of il-6. TAG2  TAG2 [406] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 passive antibodies TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 transferring purified and concentrated  TAG2 antibodies TAG2  produced by the  TAG2 immune systems TAG2  of those who have recovered from covid‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of  TAG2 passive immunisation TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [407] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [408] TAG2  TAG2  the safety and effectiveness of  TAG2 convalescent plasma TAG2  as a treatment option requires further research. TAG2  TAG2 [408] TAG2  TAG2  this strategy was tried for sars with inconclusive results. TAG2  TAG2 [407] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 viral neutralisation TAG2  is the anticipated  TAG2 mechanism of action TAG2  by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against sars-cov-2. the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. TAG2  TAG2 [409] TAG2  TAG2  it has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 and sars-cov might be useful for treating not only covid-19 but also future sars-related cov infections. TAG2  TAG2 [409] TAG2  TAG2  other mechanisms, however, such as  TAG2 antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity TAG2  and/or  TAG2 phagocytosis TAG2 , may be possible. TAG2  TAG2 [407] TAG2  TAG2  other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development. TAG2  TAG2 [407] TAG2  TAG2  production of  TAG2 convalescent serum TAG2 , which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for quicker deployment.

TAG1  TAG1 the virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). TAG2  TAG2 through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. TAG2  TAG2 these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. TAG2  TAG2 covid‑19 may be spread by people who are not showing any symptoms. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the virus may also be spread through surfaces: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 by a person touching a surface or object that has virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.  TAG2  TAG2 this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 wear a cloth face mask if you leave home. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. if surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or your elbow or a tissue. wash hands afterwards. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 avoiding close contact with people who are sick. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 stay home and away from people if you become sick with respiratory symptoms like fever and cough. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 if you smoke or vape, consider quitting.  TAG2  TAG2 smoking and vaping causes harm to the lungs TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 follow guidance from public health officials. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 please consult with your health care provider about additional steps you may be able to take to protect yourself. TAG2  TAG1 who is at higher risk for serious illness from covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 early information out of china, where covid-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. this includes: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 diabetes TAG2  TAG2 lung disease TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if you are at higher risk for serious illness from covid-19 because of your age or health condition, it is important for you to take extra actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease:  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 stay home. it's the most important thing you can do.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 protecting others TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 what is social distancing QUESTION   TAG1  TAG1 social distancing is a practice recommended by public health officials to stop or slow down the spread of contagious diseases. it requires the creation of physical space between individuals who may spread certain infectious diseases. the key is to minimize the number of gatherings as much as possible and to achieve space between individuals when events or activities cannot be modified, postponed, or canceled. achieving space between individuals of approximately six feet is advisable. additionally, there is a particular focus on creating space between individuals who have come together on a one-time or rare basis and who have very different travel patterns such as those coming from multiple countries, states or counties.

TAG2  TAG2 across the country, more than 3.7 million americans have been infected with covid-19, and more than 140,811 people have died, according to TAG2  data from johns hopkins university TAG2 .  TAG2  TAG2 positive  TAG2 results from three vaccine trials TAG2  reported monday offered some rays of hope. TAG2  TAG2 results from a phase 1/2 trial published in the journal the lancet suggest a university of oxford and astrazeneca vaccine is safe and induces an immune response to the virus.  TAG2  TAG2 the results were &quot;at the high end of our expectations,&quot; adrian hill, the lead researcher in the trial, told cnn's kate bolduan on monday.  TAG2  TAG2 the key question is whether that response is &quot;strong enough, potent enough, to stop this infection happening,&quot; hill said.  TAG2  TAG2 in animal data, the answer is probably yes, he said, &quot;but humans could be different.&quot; the trial involved 1,077 people. TAG2  TAG2 &quot;in terms of how long it will last, we're less concerned about that. we've used this vaccine type before. immunity is durable, certainly for a year, probably for longer than that,&quot; hill said.  TAG2  TAG2 more phase 2 results published monday on cansino biologics' vaccine suggest it is safe and created an immune response. the trial involved more than 500 people given high, low or placebo doses of the vaccine. TAG2  TAG2 it's not yet clear whether any would protect people from the virus in the real world. large phase 3 trials expected to begin in the coming months are needed to determine whether they work. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 governor: requiring masks was 'an easy decision' to protect the economy TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 while many governors are reluctant to shut down their states again, many are turning to mask mandates instead. TAG2  TAG2 in colorado, gov. jared polis said his state noticed decreased spread of the virus in places where more people wore face masks. polis  TAG2 issued  TAG2 a face mask mandate statewide that took effect july 17. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 top health officials have changed their minds about face mask guidance -- but for good reason TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 &quot;with the desire to keep the economy open, to maximize the ability to return to school in as safe a way as possible for teachers and for students, the mask mandate was really an easy decision after i saw that data,&quot; polis told abc's &quot;this week.&quot; TAG2  TAG2 doctors and scientists have repeatedly said masks are  TAG2 among the most powerful weapons americans can use against the virus TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, has urged governors and mayors to be &quot;as forceful as possible&quot; to get americans to wear face coverings.  TAG2  TAG2 in florida, where daily new TAG2  cases have tripled in a month TAG2 , the governor has resisted implementing a mandate and said the state would not be prosecuting people who don't wear face coverings. TAG2  TAG2 but in miami, officials are doubling down on an existing mask order. starting monday, residents who fail to wear a face mask in public will be fined without first getting a warning. that fine starts at $50 and will increase at every additional offense.

TAG2  TAG2 in arizona, 87 health care professionals signed a letter urging the state leader to keep schools closed for the first quarter of the school year. the governor has indicated he'll give more guidance on school reopenings in the coming days. TAG2  TAG2 &quot;we share a common concern: that the tremendous pressure to return to in-person schooling in august is ill-advised and dangerous given the uncontrolled spread of covid-19 in our community,&quot; the letter said.  TAG2  TAG2 the  TAG2 decisions about a return to class TAG2  come as  TAG2 new research reveals TAG2  older children (between the ages of 10 and 19) can transmit the virus within a household just as much as adults.  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 covid-19 has parents frantically searching for school alternatives, even if they can't afford them TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 the researchers in south korea also found that children ages 9 and younger transmitted the virus within their household at rates that were a lot lower. TAG2  TAG2 &quot;although the detection rate for contacts of preschool-aged children was lower, young children may show higher attack rates when the school closure ends, contributing to community transmission of covid-19,&quot; the study said.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the raise was announced tuesday by chancellor rishi sunak who said that the front line staff make a “vital contribution” to a country that has always relied on them. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “it’s right that we follow the recommendations of the independent pay bodies with this set of real-terms pay rises,” sunak said. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 those set to receive a pay increase include teachers, who will see a 3.1 percent increase and doctors and dentists who will receive a 2.8 percent raise. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 police officers, prison workers and members of the armed forces will also be given raises along with senior civil servants. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 while many hailed the news, others pointed out that the pay raises were long overdue, following years of slashed funds and pay caps on the salaries of national health service staff. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 social care workers were left out of the raises, along with the country’s nurses, but british media reported that this was due to midwives, hospital porters and nurses being covered by a deal struck in 2018 to raise their salaries over the  TAG2 next three years.  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 more than 300 nhs workers have died as a result of the virus, with some forced to care for infected patients without adequate personal protective equipment or direct access to test kits. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 last week, france announced a new deal that will see its health-care workers receive a “historic” pay raise worth more than 8 billion euros (about $9 billion) an average of $207 a month per worker.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 under the testing agreement between the league and the nfl players association, players will be tested daily for the first two weeks of training camp. daily testing will continue as long as the rate of positive tests of players, coaches and other team staffers is above 5 percent. the league expects to receive test results within 24 hours. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “i think that this latest agreement with testing protocols between the league and the players association reflects a continuation of the collaborative work that we’ve been doing,” said allen sills, the nfl’s chief medical officer.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as more tourists visit the island’s reopened tourism sector and new cases shoot up, the u.s. territory will ban the sale of alcohol and force most businesses to close during the first day of each week, its governor said monday. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “things have gotten out of control on weekends,” gov. wanda vázquez said,  TAG2 according to TAG2  the associated press. “many people are forgetting that we still face an emergency because of the covid-19 pandemic.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as of july 26, only pharmacies, grocery stores, gas stations and restaurants will allowed to remain open on sundays, vázquez said. churches will be permitted to stay open, too. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a rolling average of new daily infections on the island of 3.2 million people have shot upwards since late june, according to  TAG2 data tracked by the washington post TAG2 , with hospitalizations reaching record a high on monday, too. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 officials have reported more than 12,000 confirmed or probable cases and 180 deaths, and a steady rise in infections have prompted the territory’s government to roll back several reopening measures. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 last week, vázquez ordered bars, gyms, movie theaters and casinos to close once again and said residents and visitors could only go to beaches for exercise. besides the sunday business closures, she said more rollbacks could be announced this week. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 puerto rico is still struggling to recover from hurricane maria in 2017 and repeated earthquakes earlier this year, and many worry that a particularly serious outbreak could overwhelm the island. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 but with island residents also reeling from the pandemic’s economic devastation, some fear a second shutdown could also have serious effects. miguel vega, the former president of the island’s trade association for hotels, urged the government to allow pools and casinos to remain open, the ap reported.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 canada relies on america for everything from fresh lettuce to toilet paper. but a growing number of canadian long-haul truckers who deliver those imports are worried by what they’re seeing on their trips south, and have even started turning down work because they fear entering the united states. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “i just don’t trust them,” dan carson, an ontario truck driver who has stopped making regular runs across the windsor-detroit border, told  TAG2 globalnews.ca.  TAG2 americans don’t seem to be taking the coronavirus crisis seriously, he said, and he isn’t willing to take the risk of “finding out you’ve got to sit inside a crowded drivers’ room with someone who refuses to wear a mask or thinks it’s all a bunch of malarkey.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 truck drivers are among the only people permitted to cross into canada without undergoing a 14-day quarantine, and some have  TAG2 urged canadian leaders TAG2  to extend those restrictions through the end of the year. leanne steeves, a trucker who makes regular weekly trips from ontario to california, told the  TAG2 canadian broadcasting corp. TAG2  that what she had witnessed in the united states was “scary” — particularly the lack of masks. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “it’s like they don’t care. life is normal. nothing’s changed for them,” she said. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 while steeves told the canadian broadcasting corp. that she and her husband couldn’t afford to stop taking jobs in the united states, another long-haul driver told the outlet that he planned to “take a hit.” jeff henderson traveled to texas in late june, and was shocked to see people “congregating like nothing is happening” or getting turned away when they tried to seek out testing, he said. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “i’m not going to put myself in that position again,” he told the outlet.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 president trump told reporters monday that they’ll restart tuesday at 5 p.m. eastern time. it’s not immediately clear who will participate and how often they’ll happen, but if they’re at the white house, it’s a safe bet that trump will take center stage, as he did in the past. his comments to reporters suggest as much. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 restarting these briefings carries political pros and cons for trump, who is down in the polls to presumptive democratic presidential nominee  TAG2 joe biden TAG2  in large part because americans disapprove of how the president has handled the pandemic.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 of the nearly 350 professional basketball players tested for the novel coronavirus at the league’s disney world campus, none tested positive, the association  TAG2 said TAG2  monday. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the rare positive news is a boost for the nba, which had crafted  TAG2 a pipe-dream plan TAG2  to keep 22 teams effectively locked inside an orlando campus to finish a nearly lost season as the virus ravages the rest of florida around them. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 at first, repeated series of tests conducted by the league had consistently identified infections. in june, 25 players were confirmed to have contracted the virus, and last week, the league  TAG2 announced TAG2  that 19 had tested positive this month before departing for florida. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as a full-contact, indoor sport, basketball players have an elevated risk of infecting their teammates and opponents during competition, so the league has been unflinchingly strict in enforcing safety protocols to ensure there are no traces of the virus within the nba bubble. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 of 322 players who arrived in florida, two tested positive during their mandated quarantine period, while another two were disciplined for violating quarantine guidelines, the washington post’s ben golliver  TAG2 reported TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the two players who tested positive never came in contact with fellow players or others at disney world. ahead of a slate of games beginning july 30, the lack of any more positive test results signals that competition may go ahead as planned.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the decision to extend the country’s jobkeeper and jobseeker programs until march 2021 came as the european union approved a  TAG2 $859 billion  TAG2 economic recovery plan and u.s. leaders began to debate what a  TAG2 new round of stimulus funding  TAG2 should look like. it also served as an acknowledgment that australia may not rebound from its ongoing recession as quickly as previously hoped, since new outbreaks are triggering a  TAG2 return to lockdowns  TAG2 and tighter restrictions in some states. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the welfare program was scheduled to come to an end by sept. 30, but treasury officials determined there was a “strong” case for keeping it running, the  TAG2 sydney morning herald TAG2  reported. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 australia’s jobkeeper program aims to prevent layoffs by subsidizing employees’ wages. currently, people who are working full-time receive $1,500 aud — roughly $1,056 in u.s. currency — every two weeks. those payments will be reduced to the equivalent of roughly $844 in september, then drop to about $704 in january. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 an additional benefit program, jobseeker, provided an extra biweekly $550 aud (roughly $387) to people collecting unemployment. those payments will be cut to roughly $176 in september.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “these kids have got to get back to school,” he said. “they’re at the lowest risk possible. and if they do get covid-19, which they will — and they will when they go to school — they’re not going to the hospitals. they’re not going to have to sit in doctor’s offices. they’re going to go home and they’re going to get over it.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 while researchers have found children are less likely to contract the coronavirus or experience severe symptoms, much of the science around reopening schools  TAG2 remains unsettled TAG2 . it’s unclear how often children transmit the virus to adults, a question that is crucial for determining the risk that teachers face. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 some experts also fear that students could become infected at school, then pass the virus to older family members. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 missouri is one of dozens of states to witness a record-setting  TAG2 surge of infections TAG2  in recent weeks, after remaining relatively unscathed through the spring. parsons has  TAG2 strongly encouraged TAG2  schools to reopen in august, though districts will be able to make their own decisions. many have not yet announced plans.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 plenty of attention has focused on the rapidly climbing number of young people who have contracted the virus in florida. but katie smith sloan, the president and chief executive of leadingage, said in a call with reporters monday that ballooning figures in facilities for the elderly amount to a “category five-level emergency bearing down on millions of older adults,” the miami herald  TAG2 reported TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as president trump has  TAG2 pushed to block funding for more testing and contact tracing TAG2  in an upcoming coronavirus relief bill, smith sloan, whose association represents 5,000 nonprofit facilities, urged congress to do opposite. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 since the end of june, new coronavirus cases in nursing homes rose by 153 percent for residents and 126 percent for staff, according to  TAG2 data released by florida health officials TAG2 . of florida’s more than 5,000 deaths this month, nearly half were linked to long-term care centers, the herald reported. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 steve bahmer, president and chief executive of leadingage florida, said the rise can be traced to community spread across the state. because all facilities have been closed to visitors since march, sick residents have contracted the virus from staff and vendors — who have been infected while out in their communities. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “our members have been screening and implementing very strict protocols for the better part of five months now,” bahmer said, according to the herald, “and they continue to double down on that effort, ever vigilant, to try to prevent it from getting in.”  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 more than 4,700 nursing home residents in florida have tested positive for the virus,  TAG2 state health data TAG2  shows.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the suit from the  TAG2 florida education association TAG2  asked a judge to stop gov. ron desantis (r) and education commissioner richard corcoran from requiring the return of in-person schooling without first reducing class sizes and ensuring that educators have adequate protective supplies. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the move came as confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus are increasing in many states, including florida, raising fears in some quarters that a return to brick-and-mortar schools in the fall could put students and teachers at risk and exacerbate the spread of the virus. others argue that reopening schools is a critical step in a return to normalcy.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “we support governor murphy’s decision in the interest of public health and safety,” the giants and jets said, adding that they “would prefer to have fans” but, amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, will also bar them from training camp and practices this year.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 since the early days of the pandemic, some researchers have advocated a fast way to determine whether a covid-19 vaccine works:  TAG2 intentionally attempt TAG2  to infect vaccinated volunteers with the virus, sars-cov-2. ethicists and vaccine scientists alike raised red flags, and the discussion has remained mostly theoretical. but now two key elements are taking shape: a large corps of volunteers willing to take part in a “human challenge” trial, and the well-understood lab-grown virus strains needed for the studies. TAG1  TAG1 the volunteers come from an advocacy group,  TAG2 1day sooner TAG2 , that has signed up more than 30,000 people from 140 countries. the group, co-founded by a 22-year-old, organized an  TAG2 open letter TAG2  that was signed by 15 nobel laureates and 100 other prominent researchers, ethicists, and philosophers, which it sent to u.s. national institutes of health director francis collins on 15 july. the letter urged the u.s. government “to undertake immediate preparations for human challenge trials” in young, healthy people, who are less likely to suffer severe disease from covid-19. among the signatories was adrian hill of the university of oxford, whose lab developed one of the leading covid-19 vaccine candidates and plans to produce virus strains that could be used in the trials. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 related TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 see all of our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 researchers use human challenges  TAG2 to test vaccines for other diseases TAG2 , including cholera and malaria, but in those experiments, proven drugs can help “rescue” study participants if the vaccine doesn’t work and they become seriously ill. in a  TAG2 june report on covid-19 vaccine challenges TAG2 , an advisory group to the world health organization (who) was split over whether they should take place in the absence of a rescue treatment. the group was also evenly divided on whether human challenges would truly speed the vaccine effort, given that efficacy trials using participants at risk of natural infection have already begun. still, the report offered guidelines for these trials, suggesting they should recruit volunteers between ages 18 and 25 and require them to remain in “high-level isolation units” during the study so they don’t infect others. TAG1  TAG1 sophie rose, 22, says she is ready to take part. she co-founded 1daysooner with josh morrison, a harvard law school graduate who, in 2014, helped start waitlist zero, an advocacy group for kidney donations. rose earned her bachelor’s degree in biology from stanford university in 2019 and that december moved to the university of oxford to work on cancer research, hoping to tour europe during breaks. because of covid-19, she has not yet had the chance to leave oxford. “it’s been a weird, weird turn of events,” says rose, who plans to study epidemiology at johns hopkins university’s bloomberg school of public health in the fall. TAG1  TAG1 morrison was thinking of starting an advocacy group when he came upon an unpublished literature review about covid-19 human challenge studies that rose had co-authored. he invited her to join the nascent effort. “she immediately stood out as a star in our early, informal group working on what would become 1day sooner,” says morrison, who is 35 and too old to take part in a human challenge study himself. “sophie was someone who was young enough to represent the challenge volunteer perspective, but knowledgeable enough to hold her own in any conversation with experts.” TAG1  TAG1 “this is definitely not a space that i thought i would end up in,” says rose, now the director of research for the group. “advocacy is not my area. i much prefer to lean into the research side.” TAG1  TAG1 1day sooner “is playing a major role in showing that there are young people willing to take risks for the greater good,” says stanley plotkin, a veteran vaccine researcher who has played a leading role in pushing forward the sars-cov-2 human challenge model. TAG1  TAG1 rose says she decided she would put her body on the line because of “logistical reasoning” and data. a 6 july paper she and morrison  TAG2 co-authored with their team TAG2  and academic researchers in  TAG2 clinical infectious diseases TAG2  explored ways human challenge studies might speed the search for a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine, such as revealing whether a vaccine candidate elicits the immune responses that correlate with protection. TAG1  TAG1 the challenge trials will require large amounts of strains of sars-cov-2 that are grown in a biosafety level 3 laboratory under strict “good manufacturing practices.” based on how readily the strains infect tissue cultures, developers can carefully calibrate the doses. hill’s lab at oxford—which is formally collaborating with 1day sooner—and curative inc., a biotech startup in los angeles that makes diagnostics for the disease, have both agreed to make the challenge strains. “a number of people were pretty frustrated that no one was working on this,” says fred turner, a 25-year-old who co-founded curative 6 months ago. TAG1  TAG1 making the challenge virus will likely take at least until september, turner says. at that point, according to the who proposal, trials should recruit volunteers to test three different doses to find one that causes mild respiratory illness in 70% of people. who estimates it will take 2 months after viral strains are made and characterized to launch a challenge study. TAG1  TAG1 even if human challenge trials can’t be started until late fall, they could still answer key questions about how well a potential vaccine works, rose says. and if conventional trials have failed to identify a good candidate by then, challenge trials could help triage the more than 150 covid-19 vaccines being developed. enthusiasm for the human challenge model could also grow if a rescue treatment becomes available. TAG1  TAG1 “if the last 6 months have taught us nothing else, the progression of this entire thing has been fairly uncertain,” rose says. “there is a world in which we have a vaccine by then and that would be great, but there’s also a world in which we don’t. i know i would much rather live in a world where we were ready to implement a human challenge study.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 posted in:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","NOT"

TAG2 forbes TAG2  grimly accelerated the timeline:  TAG2 “study: immunity to coronavirus may fade away within weeks.” TAG2  and the  TAG2 san francisco chronicle TAG2  took things to a truly dark place:  TAG2 “with coronavirus antibodies fading fast, vaccine hopes fade, too.” TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 terrified, i read  TAG2 the study TAG2  that launched a thousand headlines—and did not come away much less terrified. researchers at king’s college london had tested more than 90 people with covid-19 repeatedly from march to june. several weeks after infection, their blood was swimming with antibodies, which are virus-fighting proteins. but two months later, many of these antibodies had disappeared. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 read: should you get an antibody test QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the implications seemed dire. if our defenses against covid-19 evaporate in weeks, people could contract the disease for a second time, as  TAG2 some widely-shared stories TAG2  have suggested. in such a world, herd immunity would be out of the question. even more depressing, it could mean that vaccines that work on the basis of antibody response would be useless after a few months. the study conjured for me a future in which the pandemic never went away. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 i called several scientists to talk me through the study and ease my apocalyptic anxiety. their response:  TAG2 please calm down—but don’t expect us to make you feel entirely relaxed. TAG2  (i also reached out to several co-authors of the king’s college london paper, but did not hear back.) TAG1  TAG1 “i was definitely very worried when i saw the headlines,” said shane crotty, a virologist at the la jolla institute for immunology. “but then i looked at the data. and actually, looking at the data, i feel okay about it.” TAG1  TAG1 a TAG2 cquired immunity is cellular TAG2  memory. when our bodies fight off an infection, we want our immune systems to remember how to defeat it again, like a person who, after solving a big jigsaw puzzle, recognizes and remembers how to set the pieces the next time. the whole point of vaccination is to teach the immune system those same puzzle-solving lessons without exposing it to the full virus. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 read: america should prepare for a double pandemic TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 this is why the kcl study initially seemed so dreadful. it found that the number of certain active antibodies—called “neutralizing antibodies”—declined significantly between tests, especially in patients with mild or no symptoms. antibody levels are one proxy for the immune system’s memory. if they plunge quickly, that might mean that our immune system can't remember how to solve covid-19 for more than a few months at a time, dooming us to start from square one with each new exposure. no covid-19 researchers are rooting for antibody levels to decline so quickly. everyone i spoke with acknowledged that the study might reveal something important and concerning. TAG1  TAG1 but overall, the scientists converged on three reasons to hold out a bit of skepticism about the most apocalyptic headlines. TAG1  TAG1 first, our immune system is a mysterious place, and the kcl study looked at only one part of it. when a new pathogen enters the body, our adaptive immune system calls up a team of b cells, which produce antibodies, and t cells. to oversimplify a bit, the b cells’ antibodies intercept and bind to invading molecules, and the killer t cells seek and destroy infected cells. evaluating an immune response without accounting for t cells is like inventorying a national air force but leaving out the bomber jets. and, in the case of covid-19, those bomber jets could make the biggest difference.  TAG2 a growing collection of evidence TAG2  suggests that t cells provide the strongest and longest-lasting immunity to covid-19—but this study didn’t measure them at all. TAG1  TAG1 “to look at just one part of the immune response is woefully incomplete, especially if many covid patients rely more on t cells,” said eric topol, a cardiologist and the founder and director of the scripps research facility. he pointed me to  TAG2 a study TAG2  from france’s strasbourg university hospital, which found that some people recovering from covid-19 showed strong t-cell responses  TAG2 without TAG2  detectable antibodies. “there is a chance that if a similar longitudinal study looked at t-cell response, the outcome would be far more optimistic,” he said. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 second, the virologist shane crotty told me that while the decline in antibodies was troubling, it was hardly catastrophic. “it’s not unusual to have fading antibody response after several months,” he said. “the drop-off isn’t that surprising. when you look at something like the smallpox vaccine, you see the antibody response is down about 75 percent after six months. but that’s a vaccine that works for  TAG2 decades TAG2 . we need a study like this to look at covid patients six months after infection to really know what we’re dealing with.” it’s been six months since the first american covid-19 patient went to the hospital. those studies will surely come. TAG1  TAG1 third, low levels of antibodies can still be enough to knock out covid-19, because they can prime a larger immune response some time later. “it’s possible that previously-infected people could utilize [immunological memory] responses to produce new antibodies in case they are exposed to sars-cov-2 again,” pamela bjorkman, a biochemist at the california institute of technology, wrote in an email. “so i would not conclude yet that people infected with sars-cov-2 are not protected from another infection.” TAG1  TAG1 i heard a similar argument from several people, and i found it pretty confusing at first. here’s a way to unpack it: let’s say i learn to solve a rubik’s cube. three weeks later, you might ask me how i did it.  TAG2 i can’t really describe every step from memory TAG2 , i tell you. but then you hand me a rubik’s cube, and i suddenly recall my strategy and solve that sucker in half the time. similarly, the kcl study might initially seem to describe a forgetful antibody response. but, primed by the reappearance of covid-19, our immune system might snap back and mount a powerful defense. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 read: a new understanding of herd immunity TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 beyond these three caveats to the panic-stricken headlines, several other developments offer reason to be hopeful that the pandemic won’t last forever. vaccine research is continuing to blast ahead at  TAG2 an TAG2  TAG2 inspiring TAG2  TAG2 pace TAG2 .  TAG2 several TAG2  TAG2 studies TAG2  TAG2 on TAG2  TAG2 monkeys TAG2 , whose immune systems are as close to ours as that of any animal, have been promising, showing a strong and lasting immune response.  TAG2 and a recent paper TAG2  shows that 17 years after sars first struck east asia, many patients have “long-lasting t cell immunity” that  TAG2 might even be helping them fight covid-19, a k a sars-2 TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 the race to understand covid-19 is an unprecedented global effort, and each study is like a little square-inch snapshot of one massive mural. news consumers feeling jerked around by headlines that are alternatively optimistic and devastating should remember this: we are still facing a dangerous disease and learning more every week, but the immune system is a big, complicated place. no single study looking at one part of that big, complicated place should convince you that a vaccine is doomed and the pandemic will be with us forever.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 how is a patient assessed for covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 the basic premise of preventing disease transmission is to identify patients who show symptoms, isolate those patients from others for appropriate assessment, and inform appropriate staff and authorities for further response. if people appear with symptoms, they will be asked to wear a mask and answer a series of questions about their health and travel. based on their answers and vital signs, they will be isolated from other patients while covid-19 test results can be verified. this may take several days. TAG2  TAG2 patients who test positive for covid-19 are isolated and treated. currently, there is no antiviral treatment for covid-19. specific interventions are taken in more severe cases, or with patients with compromised immune systems or complex illnesses.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what can i do to protect myself against covid-19 QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 to avoid covid-19, you should: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 practice social distancing. TAG2  TAG2 wear a cloth mask as recommended by cdc guidelines. TAG2  TAG2 keep your hands clean. TAG2  TAG2 avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. TAG2  TAG2 cover your cough and sneezes to keep germs from spreading to others. TAG2  TAG2 clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces routinely. TAG2  TAG2 avoid close contact with people who are sick. TAG2  TAG2 stay home when you are sick. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 should i wear a face mask while out in public QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in light of new data about how covid-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread covid-19 illness in communities across the country, the cdc recommends that people wear a  TAG2 cloth face covering TAG2  to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. this is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of covid-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. a cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. this would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. a cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example). medical masks and n-95 respirators are reserved for health care workers and other first responders as recommended by current cdc guidance.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 preventive care TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 what tooth paste should i use QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the most important ingredient to look for when choosing toothpaste is fluoride. fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral. its use has been instrumental in the dramatic drop in tooth decay and cavity occurrence that has taken place over the past 50 years. bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches that remain on your teeth after eating. fluoride helps protect your teeth from the acid that is released when this happens. it does this in two ways. first, fluoride makes your tooth enamel stronger and less likely to suffer acid damage. second, it can reverse the early stages of acid damage by solidifying areas that have started to decay. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what is plaque and why is it harmful QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 plaque develops when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as milk, soft drinks, raisins, cakes, or candy are frequently left on the teeth. bacteria that live in the mouth thrive on these foods, producing acids as a result. over a period of time, these acids destroy tooth enamel, resulting in tooth decay. plaque can also develop on the tooth roots under the gum and cause breakdown of the bone supporting the tooth. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 how often should i floss QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 the american dental association recommends  TAG2 flossing TAG2  at least once a day to help remove plaque from the areas between your teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach. this is important because plaque that is not removed by brushing and  TAG2 flossing TAG2  can eventually harden into calculus or tartar. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 are electric toothbrushes better than manual brushes QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if a manual toothbrush is used for the appropriate amount of time, and done with proper technique, it can perform just as well as a powered toothbrush. but many people don’t brush for the recommended two to three minutes. children are also good candidates for powered brushes as their brushing habits tend to be less than optimal. while everyone certainly does not need an electric toothbrush, in many instances they can be beneficial. ask your dentist if you have any questions about which brush is best for you. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what causes bad breath QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 while bad breath (or “halitosis”) can be linked to numerous systemic diseases, the majority of bad breath originates in the mouth. a dry mouth or a low salivary flow can also influence bad odor. there are two main goals in the management of bad breath. first, controlling the bacteria that produce the sulfur compounds and second, to neutralize the sulfur compounds that are produced. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 it’s been a long time since i’ve visited the dentist. what do i need to do QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 you’re not alone! whether it’s been 6 months or 6 years, it’s never too late to get back into a healthy routine. at northgate dental, we can arrange for you to have a thorough and educational exam appointment. we have been taking care of people just like you for over 25 years, so take advantage of our experience! we’re here to help! TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 how many times a year should i have my teeth cleaned QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in a perfect world everyone would brush and floss twice a day. plaque builds up over time and this sticky bacterial film can solidify and turn into calculus or tartar. this cement-like substance is removed by the hygienist at your regular cleaning visits. a six-month interval not only serves to keep your mouth healthy and clean, it allows potential problems to be found and diagnosed earlier. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 family dentistry TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 when will my child get their first tooth QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the period when early hard teeth are growing is a major event in the life of an infant, and it can be difficult. the eruption of teeth causes inflammation, which leads to congestion, drooling, and discomfort. while the average time for the appearance of the first teeth is between five and seven months of age, there is a wide range before and after this that can still be considered “normal.” the teeth might come in as early as one month of age, or they may erupt when the child is one-and-a-half years old. generally the lower front teeth come in first, and girls’ teeth typically erupt earlier than boys. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 when should i take my child to the dentist for their first check-up QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in order to prevent dental problems, your child should see a pediatric dentist between 6-9 months for a visual examination, or no later their first birthday.  TAG2  TAG2 download “first visit” pdf TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 my child’s baby teeth have cavities. should they be filled QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if baby teeth become diseased or decayed it can lead to pain and infection. it can also be difficult for children to eat a well-balanced meal with a mouth full of cavities. untreated cavities also increase the amount of decay causing bacteria in the mouth. as permanent teeth erupt, they are at increased risk for developing cavities because of the higher bacteria count. baby teeth also hold space in the mouth for the erupting permanent teeth. if the baby teeth become decayed or are taken out too early, the permanent teeth often become crowded and will likely need braces to straighten in the future. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what are dental sealants and why do my kids need them QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the american dental association recommends that kids receive dental sealants as soon as their adult teeth erupt. dental sealants are a quick, easy, and relatively cheap solution for preventing cavities. they are thin coatings applied to the biting surfaces that help prevent bacteria and other debris from getting into the deep crevices on the teeth. young children are great candidates for preventative measures like sealants because in many cases, decay has not set in. children’s teeth tend to benefit more from sealants because these pits and groves tend to be deeper and less calcified then they are in adults. kids are notoriously bad brushers and tend to ignore the problem areas in the back of the mouth that lead to cavities and decay. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what happens if a woman has a dental problem when she is pregnant QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 pregnancy and dental work questions are common for expecting moms. preventive dental cleanings and annual exams during pregnancy are not only safe, but are recommended. the rise in hormone levels during pregnancy causes the gums to swell, bleed, and trap food causing increased irritation to your gums. preventive dental work while pregnant is essential to avoid oral infections such as gum disease, which has been linked to preterm birth. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 fillings and x-rays TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 my dentist says i have a cavity and that i need a filling. but why doesn’t my tooth hurt QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 most dental problems don’t have any symptoms until they reach more advanced stages, so don’t wait for things to hurt! it is best to get a thorough dental exam, and diagnose and treat problems early. waiting often makes problems more difficult and more expensive to fix. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what is a root canal QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 millions of teeth are treated and saved each year with root canal, or endodontic, treatment. a root canal is a treatment to repair and save a badly damaged or infected tooth. the procedure involves removing the damaged area of the tooth (the pulp), cleaning and disinfecting it and then filling and sealing it. the common causes affecting the pulp are a cracked tooth, a deep cavity, repeated dental treatment to the tooth or trauma. the term “root canal” comes from cleaning of the canals inside the tooth’s root. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what is in amalgam (silver) fillings, and are they safe QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 dental amalgam is a filling material used by dentists to restore the proper size and shape of decayed or damaged teeth. it is an alloy that includes silver, tin, copper, and liquid mercury. it was the most commonly used filling material in the world until tooth colored composite resin came along. amalgam is the most thoroughly researched and tested of all filling materials. despite controversy over the mercury content, no health disorder or illness has ever been found to be linked to it. the fda, cdc, and world health organization all view dental amalgam as a safe dental material. TAG1  TAG1 if you are unsure whether amalgam is right for you, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each filling material with your dentist. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 how safe are traditional dental x-rays, and are the new digital x-rays better QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 digital x-rays are one of the most important new advances that our profession has seen in quite some time. and at northgate dental we now use this new digital technology exclusively. the ability to reduce the exposure of radiation to the patient used by traditional x-ray while increasing the diagnostic proficiency has astounding implications. the reduction of the use of harsh chemicals and other waste materials associated with traditional x-rays is also an added benefit to our environment. TAG1  TAG1 comparatively, a traditional chest ct-scan exposes a patient to 2,800 times the radiation as a digital dental x-ray. surprisingly, you can get the same amount of radiation as one of our digital x-rays from eating about 50 bananas. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 cosmetic dentistry TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 i’m interested in changing the shape of my teeth. what options are available QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 there are several different options available to change the shape of your teeth. you can choose to make your teeth look longer, close spaces between your teeth or repair a chipped or cracked tooth. among the options are bonding, crowns, veneers, and re-contouring. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 dental bonding TAG2  is a procedure in which a tooth-colored resin material (a durable plastic material) is applied to the tooth surface and hardened with a special light, which ultimately “bonds” the material to the tooth. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 dental crowns TAG2  are tooth-shaped “caps” that are placed over teeth. the crowns, when cemented into place, fully encase the entire visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 veneers TAG2  (also called porcelain veneers or dental porcelain laminates) are wafer-thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials that are designed to cover the front surface of teeth. these shells are bonded to the front of the teeth. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 re-contouring or reshaping TAG2  of the teeth (also called odontoplasty, enameloplasty, stripping, or slenderizing) is a procedure in which small amounts of tooth enamel are removed to change a tooth’s length, shape or surface. TAG1  TAG1 each option differs with regard to cost, durability, and “chair time” necessary to complete the procedure and the best cosmetic approach to resolving your specific problem. we would be glad to discuss which one is right for you.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 dental healthcare TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 what causes teeth to decay QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 tooth decay, also known as a cavity, occurs when bacteria living in your mouth make acid that begins to eat away at your teeth. untreated tooth decay may cause infection, extreme pain and the loss of tooth. the decay process begins with the unnoticeable damage to the enamel of your teeth and then steadily progresses to deeper layers of the tooth, eventually leading to the pulp. the pulp of your teeth contains highly-sensitive blood vessels and nerves. proper oral hygiene includes brushing your teeth regularly, flossing regularly and brushing your tongue. if possible brush your teeth twice a day – morning and night. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the top causes of tooth decay include: TAG2  poor oral hygiene, improper nutrition, sugary foods, acidic foods and drinks, dry mouth issues, tooth grinding, genetics, age and avoiding the dentist. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 why do my gums bleed QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 the main cause of bleeding gums is the buildup of plaque at the gum line. this will lead to a condition called gingivitis, or inflamed gums. plaque that is not removed will harden into tartar. this will lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and bone disease known as periodontitis. bleeding gums can happen for a number of reasons, from gingivitis to a side effect of pregnancy. changing your oral care routine can also make your gums bleed. we recommend brushing and flossing regularly and getting your semiannual dental visit in to stop your gums from bleeding. certain medicines also increase the likelihood that your gums will bleed. if changing your oral care habits, adjusting your medications, and maintaining a healthy diet doesn’t help your gums stop bleeding, your next step should be to make a dental appointment.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 if a tooth is highly sensitive for more than three or four days and reacts to hot and cold temperatures, it’s best to get a diagnostic evaluation from your dentist to determine the extent of the problem.

TAG1  TAG1 how often should i brush and floss QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 brushing and flossing help control the plaque and bacteria that cause dental disease. TAG1  TAG1 plaque is a film of food debris, bacteria, and saliva that sticks to the teeth and gums.  the bacteria in plaque convert certain food particles into acids that cause tooth decay.  also, if plaque is not removed, it turns into calculus (tartar).  if plaque and calculus are not removed, they begin to destroy the gums and bone, causing periodontal (gum) disease. TAG1  TAG1 plaque formation and growth is continuous and can only be controlled by regular brushing, flossing, and the use of other dental aids TAG1  TAG1 how often should i have a dental exam and cleaning QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 you should have your teeth checked and cleaned  TAG2 at least twice a year TAG2 , though your dentist or dental hygienist may recommend more frequent visits. TAG1  TAG1 how can i tell if i have gingivitis or periodontitis (gum disease) QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 four out of five people have periodontal disease and don’t know it!  most people are not aware of it because the disease is usually painless in the early stages.  unlike tooth decay, which often causes discomfort, it is possible to have periodontal disease without noticeable symptoms.  having regular dental check-ups and periodontal examinations are very important and will help detect if periodontal problems exist. TAG1  TAG1 periodontal disease begins when plaque, a sticky, colorless, film of bacteria, food debris, and saliva, is left on the teeth and gums.  the bacteria produce toxins (acids) that inflame the gums and slowly destroy the bone.  brushing and flossing regularly and properly will ensure that plaque is not left behind to do its damage. TAG1  TAG1 how can  TAG2 cosmetic dentistry TAG2  help improve the appearance of my smile QUESTION  if you’re feeling somewhat self-conscious about your teeth, or just want to improve your smile, cosmetic dental treatments may be the answer to a more beautiful, confident smile. there are many cosmetic dental procedures available to improve your teeth and enhance your smile.  depending on your particular needs, cosmetic dental treatments can change your smile dramatically, from restoring a single tooth to having a full mouth make-over.  ask your dentist how you can improve the health and beauty of your smile with cosmetic dentistry.cosmetic procedures:  TAG2   TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 teeth whitening: TAG2   TAG2 bleaching lightens teeth that have been stained or discolored by age, food, drink, and smoking.  teeth darkened as a result of injury or taking certain medications can also be bleached, but the effectiveness depends on the degree of staining present.  TAG2 composite (tooth-colored) fillings:  TAG2 also known as “bonding”, composite fillings are now widely used instead of amalgam (silver) fillings to repair teeth with cavities, and also to replace old defective fillings.  tooth-colored fillings are also used to repair chipped, broken, or discolored teeth.  this type of filling is also very useful to fill in gaps and to protect sensitive, exposed root surfaces caused by gum recession.  TAG2  TAG2 porcelain veneers: TAG2   TAG2 veneers are thin custom-made, tooth-colored shells that are bonded onto the fronts of teeth to create a beautiful individual smile.  they can help restore or camouflage damaged, discolored, poorly shaped, or misaligned teeth.  unlike crowns, veneers require minimal tooth structure to be removed from the surface of the tooth.  TAG2  TAG2 porcelain crowns  TAG2 (caps): TAG2  a crown is a tooth-colored, custom-made covering that encases the entire tooth surface restoring it to its original shape and size.  crowns protect and strengthen teeth that cannot be restored with fillings or other types of restorations.  they are ideal for teeth that have large, fractured or broken fillings and also for those that are badly decayed. with our  TAG2 cerec  TAG2 technology you can have those done in one visit!!!!  TAG2  TAG2 dental implants: TAG2  TAG2  dental implants are artificial roots that are surgically placed into the jaw to replace one or more missing teeth.  porcelain crowns, bridges, and dentures can be made specifically to fit and attach to implants, giving a patient a strong, stable, and durable solution to removable dental appliances.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 we hope you find the information to follow informative and helpful, but please don’t hesitate to reach out to us directly for answers to more pressing questions or for more detail. enjoy! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 why do regular dentist visits matter QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 an excellent first question and a place we love to start! people are inherently trained to think about their health care as something you address when an issue arises. but in fact, so many complications can be avoided by proactive behavior. this is especially true for visits to the dentist for your dental care. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a dentist can identify issues before they become severe, or even  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 stop them from happening at all TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 . treatment can, therefore, be easier and more affordable, and who doesn’t like that QUESTION  beyond oral health issues, a dentist can identify other serious health issues outside of your mouth such as diabetes. so many symptoms of other diseases or medical conditions show themselves in your mouth. regular dental visits should be made at least every six months, as recommended by the american dental association! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i know when to see the dentist TAG2  TAG2  QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 as we stated in our previous answer, you should make it a part of your routine to visit the dentist once every six months in order to ensure proper dental care and overall health, and a  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 good dentist TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  will let you know about other visits that might be required as well. but in case something unexpected comes up, here are some reasons you might know to go see your dentist: TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your teeth are sensitive to hot or cold TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your mouth is often dry TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your gums are puffy or bleed when you brush TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your jaw pops or is painful when opening and closing TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 these are just a few common signs that a trip to your dental office would be necessary, but there are certainly far more. if anything seems different or wrong relating to your teeth or mouth, it’s best to set an appointment and have it checked out. we guarantee you’ll be happy you did! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what kind of toothbrush and toothpaste should i use QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 brushing your teeth daily is a critical piece of maintaining your dental health. we recommend that you brush your teeth at least twice per day, but really, you should brush after every meal to most effectively prevent plaque build-up. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 use soft-bristled toothbrushes TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 replace them at least every 3-4 months TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 both manual and powered toothbrushes are fine when used with proper technique TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 always use fluoride toothpaste and look for ones with the seal of acceptance from the american dental association TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 as far as what kind of toothbrush and toothpaste to use, stick with soft-bristled toothbrushes to avoid damage to your teeth and gums from medium or firm ones. use soft pressure for at least two minutes, twice a day. both manual and powered toothbrushes work well when used with proper technique. replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months at least and always use fluoride toothpaste, which strengthens and protects your teeth. there are lots of kinds of toothpaste out there, but any toothpaste with the ada seal of acceptance is a solid choice. don’t be afraid to ask your dentist what they recommend you use. beyond that, flavor and other features are really up to you! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do i actually need to floss QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the short answer to this question is yes. the longer answer to this question is, heck yes! flossing is important because it clears the areas between your teeth where food particles and plaque get stuck and build up. left untreated, that plaque wears down your tooth’s enamel and causes cavities. tooth decay is a serious issue and should be avoided to maintain strong dental care. keep from costly crowns, tooth extractions and possibly dentures and just floss, ok QUESTION ! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i prevent cavities QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 many of the things we’ve touched on above in this post are great ways to prevent cavities, but it never hurts to hammer them home again! the biggest thing is to of course make sure you are brushing your teeth for at least two minutes per day and twice per day at a minimum. that’s how long it takes to remove the bacteria from your teeth that destroy tooth enamel. flossing breaks free the plaque between your teeth, which is commonly where cavities begin!

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 how often should i have my kids’ teeth checked QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 regular professional cleanings help prevent both cavities and gum disease. that’s why you should schedule regular checkups every six months. then we can make sure your child is brushing properly and hasn’t developed any cavities! TAG1  TAG1 my child brushes his teeth regularly and doesn’t eat much candy, but he still seems to have new cavities whenever he gets a checkup. why QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 your child’s teeth are still developing, so they are softer than an adult’s teeth. this makes his teeth more vulnerable to cavities. until your child’s teeth are fully developed (in his late teen years), here are a few tips to help him prevent cavities: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 make sure he’s brushing along the gum line well enough to remove all food particles. TAG2  TAG2 try having him floss while he’s watching his favorite movie or tv show. TAG2  TAG2 talk to us about developing a regular fluoride program for your child. TAG2  TAG2 ask us about putting sealants on your child’s teeth. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what are sealants, and is it necessary for my child to get them QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 sealants are clear or shaded plastic applied to the teeth to keep them cavity-free. sealants fill in the grooved and pitted surfaces of the teeth, which are hard to clean, and shut out food particles that could get caught, causing cavities. applying sealants is a relatively inexpensive procedure – especially when compared to the cost of treating cavities and other oral health issues. TAG1  TAG1 my daughter is afraid to visit the dentist. what do you suggest that might help her relax QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 this is a common fear, even among adults! try to avoid using words like “needle” or “drill” that could cause unnecessary fear for her. and please let us know if your child is apprehensive about her visit. our staff members are experienced in dealing with anxiety and will explain all procedures in a positive and pleasant way to help her avoid any negative feelings toward dentistry. TAG1  TAG1 there are so many types of toothpaste – which is the best kind to use QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 first, check for a toothpaste with an american dental association (ada) seal of acceptance. second, choose one that contains fluoride – but only if your child is age 3 or older. for children under age 3, use water and a soft-bristled brush. third, find a flavor your child likes – we don’t want him to dislike brushing his teeth just because he doesn’t like the taste! TAG1  TAG1 what kind of toothbrush should my child use QUESTION  are electric toothbrushes better than manual toothbrushes QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 look for a toothbrush with soft, round nylon bristles, rather than medium or hard bristles. you can read more about how to help your child brush her teeth on  TAG2 our website TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 manual brushes are effective, but studies have shown electric toothbrushes can perform even better, if they’re used right. the most important thing is finding out what works best for your child. if the noise or vibration of an electric toothbrush bothers your child, then use a manual one. but if she has trouble brushing for an appropriate amount of time, consider buying her an electric toothbrush with a timer, so she knows exactly how long to brush. TAG1  TAG1 is drinking a lot of soda bad for the teeth QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 yes, any sugar-filled drink can corrode tooth enamel and lead to tooth decay. because children’s teeth are still developing, limiting sugary drinks for kids is especially important. read our  TAG2 september blog post TAG2  for more about the importance of nutrition to a child’s oral health.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 question: what is tooth erosion QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 answer: tooth erosion is the wearing away of tooth enamel by acid. the enamel is the hard calcified tissue that covers and protects the outside of the tooth. it is the hardest substance in our bodies. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the saliva in our mouth contains calcium which helps to strengthen and remineralize the teeth, however, remineralization can not occur when a great deal of acid is present.  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 question: what is an abscessed tooth QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 answer: an abscess of the tooth is an infection. an abscess can include pus and swelling of the soft gum tissues surrounding the tooth. an abscess can develop from tooth decay or tooth trauma, such as a broken tooth. if there is an opening in the enamel of a tooth, such as a cavity, bacteria can get in and infect the pulp (center) of the tooth and cause an abscess.  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 once an abscess happens, the infection could spread throughout the mouth and body. a root canal is usually the only option to save a tooth once it has become abscessed. if you suspect that you have an abscessed tooth, you should see your dentist right away. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 question: which toothbrush is really better - manual or electric QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 answer: with all the bells and whistles and hundreds of toothbrushes on the market, you've got to wonder, which is really the best toothbrush to buy -- manual or electric QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 according to the academy of general dentistry, the best toothbrush that you can buy is the one that you will actually use. that's it. yes, it's really that simple. while both electric and manual toothbrushes have some pros and cons, the bottom line is which one you will use. the american dental association recommends brushing your teeth at least twice a day for two minutes.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what types of food should i avoid feeding my child for better dental health QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cavities are caused when bacteria in our mouths come into contact with sugars left behind in our mouths after eating. with this in mind, making  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 healthy choices in foods and drinks TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  for your child is important for good oral health. limit sodas and juices, and offer water instead. avoid gummy sweets and be sure to have them brush their teeth well after having sugary treats.  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins help your child develop strong, healthy teeth. if you have specific questions about how diet affects dental health, make a note to ask the dentist at your next appointment. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what’s the difference between a pediatric dentist and a family dentist QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a pediatric dentist is essentially a pediatrician for your child’s mouth, with specialized training for caring for children’s mouths. a family dentist cares for the whole families’ mouths. they handle tiny toddler teeth to geriatric grins and everyone in between.

TAG1  TAG1 	what are dental implants QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 	a dental implant is a small post, usually made of titanium, that serves as a substitute for the root of the tooth. a connector, known as an abutment, is placed on, or built into, the top of the dental implant, which connects it to the replacement tooth. finally, a crown, a replacement tooth, is custom fabricated to match your natural teeth, completing the dental implant. TAG1  TAG1 	how much do dental implants cost QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 	no two patients or their customized dental implants treatments are exactly alike, so the cost – as well as the number of appointments required and procedures performed – will vary depending on your particular needs. i recommend consulting an aaid-credentialed dental implant expert who can conduct a comprehensive examination and evaluate the necessary diagnostics to best determine your needs and the associated fees. discussing the dentist's payment arrangements and potential coverage from your insurance carrier are important steps in the planning process.  TAG1  TAG1 	can any dentist provide my dental implant QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 	dental implants are sophisticated dental devices that must be placed carefully to minimize complications or implant failure. for the best results, it is important that you choose a dental implant expert who has the proper education, training and competence in implant dentistry.

TAG1  TAG1 	are dental implants safe QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 	dental implants, which have been used for half a century, are safe and effective. as in any medical procedure, however, there can be complications. choosing a knowledgeable, well-trained implant dentist will help minimize complications and ensure skillful handling of any problems, should they arise. it is important that you and your implant dentist review your health history and any habits which could affect the success of your recommended care, such as smoking, so that you are fully informed about the benefits and risks involved.  TAG1  TAG1 	does it hurt to get dental implants QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 	with the sedation techniques available at the time of treatment and helpful instructions for home care, many people report that they feel better than anticipated. often, they return to work and daily activities the next day. while there may be some discomfort and bruising, this typically lasts only a short time.  TAG1  TAG1 	can my child get dental implants QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 	yes, dental implants are an excellent and smart long-term solution for children who have lost permanent teeth due to injury or accident. it’s advisable to consult with a dental implant expert as soon as possible after the teeth are lost. however, in most circumstances, the dentist will wait to perform the procedure until your child’s facial growth and development has been completed. generally, this occurs around age 16 for girls and age 18 for boys.

TAG2  TAG2   TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why are baby teeth so important QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 we’ve had some parents ask why it’s so important to care for their child’s baby teeth since they’re just going to fall out anyway. the answer is that, not only do baby teeth allow your child to speak and eat properly, but they also save space for the adult teeth to grow into later. if your child experiences dental problems in childhood, this can affect the health of their adult teeth later. losing teeth too early due to cavities or decay can also cause the baby teeth to shift, preventing permanent teeth from growing into their proper location. the earlier you begin to care for your child’s teeth, the better! TAG2  TAG2   TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how can i keep my infant’s teeth/gums clean QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 you can begin to care for your child’s dental health during infancy, even before any teeth have grown in. use a warm, damp cloth to rub your baby’s gums after each feeding in order to remove any food buildup or bacteria. once teeth do begin to grow in, brush them gently with a child-sized toothbrush and water. this will keep food debris and bacteria from building up on the vulnerable baby teeth. TAG2  TAG2   TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what should i do if my child has a toothache QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 toothaches aren’t something to be ignored, especially in young children. if your child is complaining of tooth pain, please contact our pediatric dental office, camp little tooth to set up an appointment with dr. rae. if it’s after hours, please use our emergency contact information. in the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help ease your child’s pain, including: TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 rinse your child’s mouth with warm salt water TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 administer over-the-counter pain medication as needed (check with your pediatrician or a pharmacist if you have questions about the dosage) TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 apply ice or a cold compress if your child’s face is beginning to swell – avoid using heat TAG2  TAG2   TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how can i prevent tooth decay in my child’s teeth QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 the best thing you can do to prevent tooth decay, dental cavities, and other dental health problems is to teach your children about and help them practice good oral hygiene habits. your child should be brushing his or her teeth at least twice a day and flossing at least once a day. you can begin to use a grain of rice size amount of fluoride toothpaste as soon as the first tooth erupts. lastly, make sure your child is eating a balanced diet and visiting camp little tooth pediatric dentistry every six months for a dental cleaning and checkup.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i know when to see the dentist TAG2  TAG2  QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 as we stated in our previous answer, you should make it a part of your routine to visit the dentist once every six months in order to ensure proper dental care and overall health, and a good dentist will let you know about other visits that might be required as well. but in case something unexpected comes up, here are some reasons you might know to go see your dentist: TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your teeth are sensitive to hot or cold TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your mouth is often dry TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your gums are puffy or bleed when you brush TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 your jaw pops or is painful when opening and closing TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 these are just a few common signs that a trip to your dental office would be  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 necessary TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 , but there are certainly far more. if anything seems different or wrong relating to your teeth or mouth, it’s best to set an appointment and have it checked out. we guarantee you’ll be happy you did! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what kind of toothbrush and toothpaste should i use QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 brushing your teeth daily is a critical piece of maintaining your dental health. we recommend that you brush your teeth at  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 least twice per day TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 , but really, you should brush after every meal to most effectively prevent plaque build-up. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 use soft-bristled toothbrushes TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 replace them at least every 3-4 months TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 both manual and powered toothbrushes are fine when used with proper technique TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 always use fluoride toothpaste and look for ones with the seal of acceptance from the american dental association TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 as far as what kind of toothbrush and toothpaste to use, stick with soft-bristled toothbrushes to avoid damage to your teeth and gums from medium or firm ones. use soft pressure for at least two minutes, twice a day. both manual and powered toothbrushes work well when used with proper technique. replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months at least and always use fluoride toothpaste, which strengthens and protects your teeth. there are lots of kinds of toothpaste out there, but any toothpaste with the ada seal of acceptance is a solid choice. don’t be afraid to ask your dentist what they recommend you use. beyond that, flavor and other features are really up to you! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do i actually need to floss QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the short answer to this question is yes. the longer answer to this question is, heck yes! flossing is important because it clears the areas between your teeth where food particles and plaque get stuck and build up. left untreated, that plaque wears down your tooth’s enamel and causes cavities. tooth decay is a serious issue and  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 should be avoided TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  to maintain strong dental care. keep from costly crowns, tooth extractions and possibly dentures and just floss, ok QUESTION ! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 why do regular dentist visits matter QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 an excellent first question and a place we love to start! people are inherently trained to think about their health care as something you address when an issue arises. but in fact, so many complications can be avoided by proactive behavior. this is especially true for visits to the dentist for your dental care. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a dentist can identify issues before they  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 become severe TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 , or even stop them from happening at all. treatment can, therefore, be easier and more affordable, and who doesn’t like that QUESTION  beyond oral health issues, a dentist can identify other serious health issues outside of your mouth such as diabetes. so many symptoms of other diseases or medical conditions show themselves in your mouth. regular dental visits should be made at least every six months, as recommended by the american dental association! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i prevent cavities QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 many of the things we’ve touched on above in this post are great ways to prevent cavities, but it never hurts to hammer them home again! the biggest thing is to of course make sure you are brushing your teeth for at least two minutes per day and twice per day at a minimum. that’s how long it takes to remove the bacteria from your teeth that  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 destroy tooth enamel TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 . flossing breaks free the plaque between your teeth, which is commonly where cavities begin! TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 brush TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 make regular dentist visits TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 avoid sugary foods and drinks TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 beyond brushing and flossing, it’s important to see your dentist regularly to get professional teeth cleanings and checkups, which can help identify and prevent cavities from starting. and certainly, watch what you eat! avoid sugars and soft drinks as much as possible as they are the main culprits for cavities! TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long does teeth whitening last QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 a highly popular form of cosmetic dentistry, teeth whitening helps your smile shine, but it doesn’t last forever because the same factors that caused you to get your teeth whitened in the first place still exist. while it can vary how long each teeth whitening can last, depending on what you eat, if you smoke, things like that, a teeth whitening can generally last up to a couple of years. however, routine touch-ups are typically a good idea as the results fade.

TAG1  TAG1 why should i choose a pediatric dentist instead of a general dentist QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a general dentist, like a general health care provider, is definitely qualified to understand your child’s health. most parents prefer to take their child to a pediatrician because these doctors are not only specially trained in unique childhood illnesses and care, but in working with kids to make them feel comfortable and safe. pediatric dentists offer the same specialized knowledge and care for your child’s oral health. our dentists have two or more years of post-doctoral training in diagnosing and treating oral health concerns specific to kids and working with unique behavioral challenges children present. TAG1  TAG1 how can i prepare my children for their first visit QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 we encourage patients to make a trip to the dentist sound like fun. once kids reach an age where they understand more, parents can make countdowns to the dental office, have kids create brushing and flossing charts they can be excited to show our team, and bring kids in a little earlier for office tours. for parents who experience anxiety or fear associated with the dentist, we encourage you to answer questions, but try not to let your own anxiety color the child’s experience. TAG1  TAG1 what are the most common oral health concerns for kids QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 tooth decay is extremely prevalent among children especially if they consume a lot of sugar, but there are other conditions unique to developing dentition. for instance, babies need help breaking habits like thumb sucking and falling asleep with bottles, more and more toddlers are showing signs of gum inflammation that may be an early form of gingivitis, and kids may display concerns in dental development like crooked, gapped, or crowded teeth that we can begin treating as soon as permanent teeth emerge. TAG1  TAG1 can you teach my child to brush and floss QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 one of the best things about working with young patients is getting to help them develop great oral health habits, and we love to explain and demonstrate proper brushing and flossing for you and your children. if you’re struggling with teaching kids to care for teeth at home, we’ll be happy to help you develop a fun hygiene routine that makes kids want to brush and floss. TAG1  TAG1 should my child get dental sealants or fluoride treatments QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 we often recommend sealants and fluoride treatments for kids. their teeth are just developing and so is the ability to care for them. sealants help keep out decay-causing bacteria, and fluoride treatments strengthen tooth enamel fortifying teeth. these treatments are a great way to protect your child’s oral health. TAG1  TAG1 when should my child begin orthodontic screenings QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 many parents are surprised when we begin discussing orthodontic treatment plans as soon as the first permanent tooth erupts, but by diagnosing and beginning orthodontic treatment during dental development, we offer kids more effective treatment with less discomfort.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 		how should i prepare my child for the dentist QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		in order to make sure that your child is comfortable in our office from the very beginning, we recommend bringing them in for a “get to know you” visit before their actual checkup. that way, they have a chance to meet dr. bajjalieh and our team as well as be exposed to the sights and sounds of the dental office. you should also go over what their appointment will be like, especially pointing out how important it is. if your child has any questions, be sure to answer them honestly. if they seem like they will be nervous, we advise you bring a stuffed animal or toy that will help them feel calm. TAG1  TAG1 		how often should my child see a dentist QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		we recommend that every child should come in for at least two checkups and cleanings each year in order to prevent the most common dental problems (decay, cavities, gum disease, etc.). some children may require more depending on their specific needs, but for most, two is enough to keep their smile fully protected year round. TAG1  TAG1 		why are baby teeth important QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		your child’s baby teeth are essential to helping their mouth and jaws grow properly in order to make enough room for their adult teeth to come in straight. they are also important to the development of your child’s ability to eat, speak, and even breathe comfortably. if ignored, issues with the baby teeth can easily cause more for the adult teeth down the line, which is why early-age dental care is so necessary. TAG1  TAG1 		how should i care for my baby's teeth QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		a toothbrush with soft bristles and a small head, especially one designed for infants, is the best choice for infants. brushing at least twice a day, flossing at bedtime and eating a healthy diet will remove plaque/bacteria that can lead to decay. it is equally important to visit the dentist twice a year, where we can provide an individualized plan of care for a healthy smile at each visit. TAG1  TAG1 		at what age should my child have his/her first dental visit QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 &quot;first visit by first birthday&quot; is the general rule. to prevent dental problems, your child should see a pediatric dentist when the first tooth appears, usually between 6 and 12 months of age and certainly no later than his/her first birthday. you may contact us to schedule an appointment with dr. bajjalieh at alabama pediatric dentistry. we are located in homewood, al and are convenient to the birmingham metro area. TAG1  TAG1 		why should my child see a pediatric dentist instead of our regular family dentist QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		pediatric dentistry is a dental specialty that focuses on the oral health of young people. following dental school, a pediatric dentist has two to three years additional specialty training in the unique needs of infants, children and adolescents, including those with special health needs. TAG1  TAG1 		what is the best way to stop oral habits QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 	for any concerns about an oral habit your child may be experiencing, please contact our office. whether it be thumbsucking or taking a bottle to bed, we have many options for ways to treat the habit. the sooner the habit can be stopped, the less damage will occur TAG1  TAG1 		what are dental sealants and how do they work QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		sealants are clear or shaded plastic that’s applied to the teeth to help keep them cavity-free. sealants fill in the grooved and pitted surfaces of the teeth, which are hard to clean, and shut out food particles that could get caught and cause cavities. fast and comfortable to apply, our bpa-free sealants can effectively protect teeth for many years. TAG1  TAG1 		is it important for my child to use a fluoride toothpaste QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		by using no more than a smear or rice-size amount of fluoridated toothpaste for children less than three years of age may decrease risk of fluorosis. for children aged three to six, this amount increases to no more than a pea-size amount of fluoridated toothpaste. so we recommend fluoridated toothpaste (smear for less than 3 years old and an english pea size for 3 and older) according to aapd guidelines. children should spit any excess toothpaste or have their mouths wiped out. TAG1  TAG1 		how safe are dental x-rays QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		with contemporary safeguards, such as lead aprons and digital sensors, the amount of radiation received in a dental x-ray examination is extremely small. even though there is very little risk, pediatric dentists are particularly careful to minimize the exposure of child patients to radiation. in fact, dental x-rays represent a far smaller risk than an undetected and untreated dental problem. TAG1  TAG1 	my child plays sports. how should i protect my child's teeth QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		a mouthguard should be a top priority on your child's list of sports equipment. athletic mouth protectors, or mouth guards, are made of soft plastic and fit comfortably to the shape of the upper teeth. they protect a child's teeth, lips, cheeks and gums from sports-related injuries. any mouthguard works better than no mouthguard, but a custom-fitted mouth guard fitted by our doctor is your child's best protection against sports-related injuries. TAG1  TAG1 		when do the first teeth start to erupt QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		at about 6 months, the two lower front teeth (central incisors) will erupt, followed shortly by the two upper central incisors. the remainder of the baby teeth appear during the next 18 to 24 months but not necessarily in an orderly sequence from front to back. at 2 to 3 years, all of these 20 primary teeth should be present. TAG1  TAG1 		what should i do if my child knocks out a permanent tooth QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 		first of all, remain calm. if possible, find the tooth and hold it by the crown rather than the root. replace the tooth in the socket and hold it there with clean gauze or a washcloth. if you can't put the tooth back in the socket, place the tooth in a clean container with milk and take your child and the glass immediately to the pediatric dentist. the faster you act, the better your chances of saving the tooth. TAG1  TAG1 		if my child gets a cavity in a baby tooth, should it still be filled QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 primary, or &quot;baby,&quot; teeth are important for many reasons. not only do they help children speak clearly and chew naturally, they also aid in forming a path that permanent teeth can follow when they are ready to erupt. some of them are necessary until a child is 12 years old or longer. pain, infection of the gums and jaws, impairment of general health, and the premature loss of teeth are just a few of the problems that can happen when baby teeth are neglected. also, because tooth decay is really an infection and will spread, decay on baby teeth can cause decay on permanent teeth. proper care of baby teeth is instrumental in enhancing the health of your child.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 maintaining dental health TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 maintaining dental health has two main components — at-home dental hygiene and professional cleanings and examinations. simple maintenance of your dental health can prevent complications such as tooth loss, as well as the need for restorative or cosmetic dentistry in the future. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								how can i prevent tooth decay and gum disease QUESTION 								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 good oral hygiene starts at home, though it needs to be supplemented by regular visits to our cosmetic and general dentistry practice. steps you can take to prevent tooth decay and gum disease include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								proper flossing								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 brushing our teeth removes food particles, plaque, and bacteria from all tooth surfaces, except in between the teeth. unfortunately, our toothbrush can’t reach these areas that are highly susceptible to decay and periodontal (gum) disease. TAG1  TAG1 daily flossing is the best way to clean between the teeth and under the gumline. flossing not only helps clean these spaces, it disrupts plaque colonies from building up, preventing damage to the gums, teeth, and bone. TAG1  TAG1 plaque is a sticky, almost invisible film that forms on the teeth. it is a growing colony of living bacteria, food debris, and saliva. the bacteria produce toxins (acids) that cause cavities and irritate and inflame the gums. also, when plaque is not removed above and below the gumline, it hardens and turns into calculus (tartar). this will further irritate and inflame the gums and also slowly destroy the bone. this is the beginning of periodontal disease. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								how to floss properly								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 take 12-16 inches (30-40cm) of dental floss and wrap it around your middle fingers, leaving about 2 inches (5cm) of floss between the hands. TAG2  TAG2 using your thumbs and forefingers to guide the floss, gently insert the floss between teeth using a sawing motion. TAG2  TAG2 curve the floss into a “c” shape around each tooth and under the gumline. gently move the floss up and down, cleaning the side of each tooth. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 floss holders are recommended if you have difficulty using conventional floss. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								thorough brushing								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 brush your teeth at least twice a day (especially before going to bed at night) with an ada approved soft bristle brush and toothpaste. TAG1  TAG1 electric toothbrushes are also recommended. they are easy to use and can remove plaque efficiently. simply place the bristles of the electric brush on your gums and teeth and allow the brush to do its job. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								use of mouth rinse								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 after flossing and brushing it is important to use a mouth rinse with fluoride for the prevention of decay, or with alcohol for gum disease. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								regular dental visits								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 at every regularly-scheduled dental appointment at weston dental care, one of our dentists will carefully check your teeth, gums, mouth, and neck. a checkup includes: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 a clinical dental examination: this includes a periodontal exam and examinations of the mobility of teeth, the mucous membranes, saliva, occlusion (bite), removable appliances, and contact between teeth. if we detect tooth decay or broken fillings, we will discuss appropriate action with you. TAG2  TAG2 a set of digital x-rays TAG2  TAG2 a dental cleaning (prophylaxis): this includes scaling plaque, polishing teeth, flossing, assessing your mouth’s cleanliness, and providing oral hygiene instructions.following the clinical dental exam, your dentist will discuss a detailed treatment plan, if necessary. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								how does fluoride help prevent tooth decay QUESTION 								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 fluoride helps reverse and prevent tooth decay in three ways: TAG1  TAG1 1. promoting tooth remineralizationacids can demineralize a tooth — that is, create a weak spot that develops into a cavity. fluoride helps promote the opposite process, called remineralization, which can reverse the very early stages of tooth decay. TAG1  TAG1 2. helping teeth become more resistant to tooth decayfluoride actually strengthens teeth, giving them natural protection against future tooth decay. TAG1  TAG1 3. inhibiting oral bacteria’s ability to create tooth-attacking acidsfluoride disrupts bacteria’s ability to metabolize sugars, the process that leads to the attack of tooth enamel. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								what are the stages of gum disease QUESTION  how is gum disease treated QUESTION 								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 gum disease has several stages. the initial stage is called gingivitis and is an infection of the gingival (gum tissue). in this stage, gums become red, swollen, and prone to bleeding. the underlying bone is unaffected. in later stages, however, gum disease can lead to bone loss and the loosening or even loss of teeth.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								if i am missing one or more teeth, what are my options QUESTION 								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 patients today have an array of options for replacing missing teeth. dental bridges, dentures, and dental implants all have their advantages and disadvantages, though modern cosmetic and restorative dentistry has come to favor dental implants because they look and function just like real teeth and require no special care. TAG1  TAG1 if you have lost a tooth or several teeth, we urge you to seek treatment. adjacent teeth can shift into the gap left by a lost tooth; in addition, a missing tooth can lead to bone loss, hygiene problems, difficulties with speaking and eating, and much more. today’s dental restorations are better than ever, and they can give you a strong bite and a beautiful smile. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								who is a good candidate for dental implants QUESTION 								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 nearly anyone who is missing one or more teeth, and desires a superior, long-lasting aesthetic result is a good candidate for dental implants. however, patients must have enough bone to support and stabilize the implant. some individuals who have suffered bone loss as a result of gum disease or another condition may need bone grafting before a dental implant can be placed successfully. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								what is a dental implant QUESTION 								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 this is a surgical procedure designed to replace a missing tooth. a dental implant is a titanium cylinder that is placed in the bone and replaces what was once the root of the tooth. a crown is attached to the implant to simulate an individual tooth. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								how is a dental implant different from a dental bridge QUESTION 								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a dental implant literally replaces a missing tooth. a dental implant simulates the root of a tooth to which the cosmetic dentist attaches a cosmetic tooth. a dental bridge, on the other hand, is non-surgical and uses the adjacent teeth to support a new cosmetic tooth. a dental implant is not invasive to surrounding teeth (especially desirable if they are healthy and in good condition). by simulating the root, it engages the bone and keeps it healthy. because a dental implant is an individual tooth it is also easier to floss. a dental bridge can be a good choice if the adjacent teeth are in need of restoration. however, there are other subtle factors such as age, timing and bone health that you should discuss when deciding which options may be best for you. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 								how long does the dental implant process take QUESTION 								 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 once a person is deemed a good candidate for dental implants, then there is one visit to surgically place the implant. some applications are ready for immediate restoration, others may be required to wait anywhere from 3 to 6 months for bone growth to solidify around the implant to anchor it. at this point the implant can be restored to completion.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 there are various reasons one may have bad breath, but in healthy people, the major reason is due to microbial deposits on the tongue, especially the back of the tongue.  some studies have shown that simply brushing the tongue reduced bad breath by as much as 70 percent. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what may cause bad breath QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 morning time TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – saliva flow almost stops during sleep and its reduced cleansing action allows bacteria to grow, causing bad breath. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 certain foods TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – garlic, onions, etc.  foods containing odor-causing compounds enter the blood stream; they are transferred to the lungs, where they are exhaled. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 poor oral hygiene habits TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – food particles remaining in the mouth promote bacterial growth. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 periodontal (gum) disease TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – colonies of bacteria and food debris residing under inflamed gums. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 dental cavities and improperly fitted dental appliances TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – may also contribute to bad breath.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 dehydration, hunger, and missed meals TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – drinking water and chewing food increases saliva flow and washes bacteria away. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 certain medical conditions and illnesses TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – diabetes, liver and kidney problems, chronic sinus infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia are several conditions that may contribute to bad breath. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 keeping a record of what you eat may help identify the cause of bad breath.  also, review your current medications, recent surgeries, or illnesses with your dentist. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what can i do to prevent bad breath QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 practice good oral hygiene TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – brush at least twice a day with an ada approved fluoride toothpaste and toothbrush.  floss daily to remove food debris and plaque from in between the teeth and under the gumline.  brush or use a tongue scraper to clean the tongue and reach the back areas.  replace your toothbrush every 2 to 3 months.  if you wear dentures or removable bridges, clean them thoroughly and place them back in your mouth in the morning. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 see your dentist regularly TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – get a check-up and cleaning at least twice a year.  if you have or have had periodontal disease, your dentist will recommend more frequent visits.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 in most cases, your dentist can treat the cause of bad breath.  if it is determined that your mouth is healthy, but bad breath is persistent, your dentist may refer you to your physician to determine the cause of the odor and an appropriate treatment plan. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2               q:             TAG2             how often should i brush and floss QUESTION            TAG1  TAG2  TAG2               a:             TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 brushing and flossing help control the plaque and bacteria that cause dental disease. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 plaque is a film of food debris, bacteria, and saliva that sticks to the teeth and gums.  the bacteria in plaque convert certain food particles into acids that cause tooth decay.  also, if plaque is not removed, it turns into calculus (tartar).  if plaque and calculus are not removed, they begin to destroy the gums and bone, causing periodontal (gum) disease. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 plaque formation and growth is continuous and can only be controlled by regular brushing, flossing, and the use of other dental aids. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 toothbrushing TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – brush your teeth  TAG2  TAG2 at least twice a day TAG2  TAG2  (especially before going to bed at night) with an ada approved soft bristle brush and toothpaste.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 brush your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 electric toothbrushes are also recommended.  they are easy to use and can remove plaque efficiently.  simply place the bristles of the electric brush on your gums and teeth and allow the brush to do its job, several teeth at a time. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 flossing TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  –  TAG2 daily flossing TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  is the best way to clean between the teeth and under the gumline.  flossing not only helps clean these spaces, it disrupts plaque colonies from building up, preventing damage to the gums, teeth, and bone. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 take 12-16 inches (30-40cm) of dental floss and wrap it around your middle fingers, leaving about 2 inches (5cm) of floss between the hands. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 using your thumbs and forefingers to guide the floss, gently insert the floss between teeth using a sawing motion. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 curve the floss into a “c” shape around each tooth and under the gumline.  gently move the floss up and down, cleaning the side of each tooth. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 floss holders are recommended if you have difficulty using conventional floss. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 rinsing TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – it is important to rinse your mouth with water after brushing, and also after meals if you are unable to brush.  if you are using an over-the-counter product for rinsing, it’s a good idea to consult with your dentist or dental hygienist on its appropriateness for you. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2               q:             TAG2             are amalgam (silver) fillings safe QUESTION            TAG1  TAG2  TAG2               a:             TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 over the years there has been some concern as to the safety of amalgam (silver) fillings.  an amalgam is a blend of copper, silver, tin and zinc, bound by elemental mercury.  dentists have used this blended metal to fill teeth for more than 100 years.  the controversy is due to claims that the exposure to the vapor and minute particles from the mercury can cause a variety of health problems.  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 according to the american dental association (ada), up to 76% of dentists use silver containing mercury to fill teeth.  the ada also states that silver fillings are safe and that studies have failed to find any link between silver containing mercury and any medical disorder. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the general consensus is that amalgam (silver) fillings are safe.  along with the ada’s position, the center for disease control (cdc), the world health organization, the fda, and others support the use of silver fillings as safe, durable, and cost effective.  the u.s. public health service says that the only reason not to use silver fillings is when a patient has an allergy to any component of this type of filling.  the ada has had fewer than 100 reported incidents of an allergy to components of silver fillings, and this is out of countless millions of silver fillings over the decades. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 although studies indicate that there are no measurable health risks to patients who have silver fillings, we do know that mercury is a toxic material when we are exposed at high, unsafe levels.  for instance, we have been warned to limit the consumption of certain types of fish that carry high levels of mercury in them.  however, with respect to amalgam fillings, the ada maintains that when the mercury combines with the other components of the filling, it becomes an inactive substance that is safe. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 there are numerous options to silver fillings, including composite (tooth-colored), porcelain, and gold fillings.  we encourage you to discuss these options with your dentist so you can determine which is the best option for you. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2               q:             TAG2             how often should i have a dental exam and cleaning QUESTION            TAG1  TAG2  TAG2               a:             TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 you should have your teeth checked and cleaned  TAG2  TAG2 at least twice a year TAG2  TAG2 , though your dentist or dental hygienist may recommend more frequent visits. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 regular dental exams and cleaning visits are essential in preventing dental problems and maintaining the health of your teeth and gums.  at these visits, your teeth are cleaned and checked for cavities.  additionally, there are many other things that are checked and monitored to help detect, prevent, and maintain your dental health.  these include: TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 medical history review:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 knowing the status of any current medical conditions, new medications, and illnesses, gives us insight to your overall health and also your dental health.

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 removal of plaque:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 plaque is a sticky, almost invisible film that forms on the teeth.  it is a growing colony of living bacteria, food debris, and saliva.  the bacteria produce toxins (poisons) that inflame the gums.  this inflammation is the start of periodontal disease!

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 as you can see, a good dental exam and cleaning involves quite a lot more than just checking for cavities and polishing your teeth.  we are committed to providing you with the best possible care, and to do so will require regular check-ups and cleanings. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2               q:             TAG2             how can i tell if i have gingivitis or periodontitis (gum disease) QUESTION            TAG1  TAG2  TAG2               a:             TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 four out of five people have periodontal disease and don’t know it!  most people are not aware of it because the disease is usually painless in the early stages.  unlike tooth decay, which often causes discomfort, it is possible to have periodontal disease without noticeable symptoms.  having regular dental check-ups and periodontal examinations are very important and will help detect if periodontal problems exist. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 periodontal disease begins when plaque, a sticky, colorless, film of bacteria, food debris, and saliva, is left on the teeth and gums.  the bacteria produce toxins (acids) that inflame the gums and slowly destroy the bone.  brushing and flossing regularly and properly will ensure that plaque is not left behind to do its damage. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 other than poor oral hygiene, there are several other factors that may increase the risk of developing periodontal disease: TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 smoking or chewing tobacco TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – tobacco users are more likely than nonusers to form plaque and tartar on their teeth. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 certain tooth or appliance conditions TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  – bridges that no longer fit properly, crowded teeth, or defective fillings that may trap plaque and bacteria.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2               q:             TAG2             why is it important to use dental floss QUESTION            TAG1  TAG2  TAG2               a:             TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 brushing our teeth removes food particles, plaque, and bacteria from all tooth surfaces,  TAG2  TAG2 except TAG2  TAG2  in between the teeth.  unfortunately, our toothbrush can’t reach these areas that are highly susceptible to decay and periodontal (gum) disease. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 daily flossing is the best way to clean between the teeth and under the gumline.  flossing not only helps clean these spaces, it disrupts plaque colonies from building up, preventing damage to the gums, teeth, and bone. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 plaque is a sticky, almost invisible film that forms on the teeth.  it is a growing colony of living bacteria, food debris, and saliva.  the bacteria produce toxins (acids) that cause cavities and irritate and inflame the gums.  also, when plaque is not removed above and below the gumline, it hardens and turns into calculus (tartar).  this will further irritate and inflame the gums and also slowly destroy the bone.  this is the beginning of periodontal disease. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 how to floss properly:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 take 12-16 inches (30-40cm) of dental floss and wrap it around your middle fingers, leaving about 2 inches (5cm) of floss between the hands. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 using your thumbs and forefingers to guide the floss, gently insert the floss between teeth using a sawing motion. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 curve the floss into a “c” shape around each tooth and under the gumline.  gently move the floss up and down, cleaning the side of each tooth. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 floss holders are recommended if you have difficulty using conventional floss. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 daily flossing will help you keep a healthy, beautiful smile for life! TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2               q:             TAG2             how can cosmetic dentistry help improve the appearance of my smile QUESTION            TAG1  TAG2  TAG2               a:             TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 if you’re feeling somewhat self-conscious about your teeth, or just want to improve your smile, cosmetic dental treatments may be the answer to a more beautiful, confident smile. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cosmetic dentistry has become very popular in the last several years, not only due to the many advances in cosmetic dental procedures and materials available today, but also because patients are becoming more and more focused on improving their overall health.  this includes dental prevention and having a healthier, whiter, more radiant smile. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 there are many cosmetic dental procedures available to improve your teeth and enhance your smile.  depending on your particular needs, cosmetic dental treatments can change your smile dramatically, from restoring a single tooth to having a full mouth make-over.  ask your dentist how you can improve the health and beauty of your smile with cosmetic dentistry. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 cosmetic procedures: TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 teeth whitening:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 bleaching lightens teeth that have been stained or discolored by age, food, drink, and smoking.  teeth darkened as a result of injury or taking certain medications can also be bleached, but the effectiveness depends on the degree of staining present. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 composite (tooth-colored) fillings:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 also known as “bonding”, composite fillings are now widely used instead of amalgam (silver) fillings to repair teeth with cavities, and also to replace old defective fillings.  tooth-colored fillings are also used to repair chipped, broken, or discolored teeth.  this type of filling is also very useful to fill in gaps and to protect sensitive, exposed root surfaces caused by gum recession. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 porcelain veneers:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 veneers are thin custom-made, tooth-colored shells that are bonded onto the fronts of teeth to create a beautiful individual smile.  they can help restore or camouflage damaged, discolored, poorly shaped, or misaligned teeth.  unlike crowns, veneers require minimal tooth structure to be removed from the surface of the tooth. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 porcelain crowns (caps): TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  a crown is a tooth-colored, custom-made covering that encases the entire tooth surface restoring it to its original shape and size.  crowns protect and strengthen teeth that cannot be restored with fillings or other types of restorations.  they are ideal for teeth that have large, fractured or broken fillings and also for those that are badly decayed. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 dental implants: TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  dental implants are artificial roots that are surgically placed into the jaw to replace one or more missing teeth.  porcelain crowns, bridges, and dentures can be made specifically to fit and attach to implants, giving a patient a strong, stable, and durable solution to removable dental appliances. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 orthodontics:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 less visible and more effective brackets and wires are making straightening teeth with orthodontics much more appealing to adult patients.  also, in some cases, teeth may be straightened with custom-made, clear, removable aligners that require no braces. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 thanks to the advances in modern dentistry, cosmetic treatments can make a difference in making your smile shine! TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2               q:             TAG2             what are porcelain veneers and how can they improve my smile QUESTION            TAG1  TAG2  TAG2               a:             TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 porcelain veneers are very thin shells of tooth-shaped porcelain that are individually crafted to cover the fronts of teeth.  they are very durable and will not stain, making them a very popular solution for those seeking to restore or enhance the beauty of their smile. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 veneers may be used to restore or correct the following dental conditions: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 severely discolored or stained teeth TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 unwanted or uneven spaces TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 misshapen teeth  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 teeth that are too small or large TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 getting veneers usually requires two visits.  veneers are created from an impression (mold) of your teeth that is then sent to a professional dental laboratory where each veneer is custom-made (for shape and color) for your individual smile. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 with little or no anesthesia, teeth are prepared by lightly buffing and shaping the front surface of the teeth to allow for the small thickness of veneers.  the veneers are carefully fitted and bonded onto the tooth surface with special bonding cements and occasionally a specialized light may be used to harden and set the bond. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 veneers are an excellent dental treatment that can dramatically improve your teeth and give you a natural, beautiful smile. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2               q:             TAG2             what can i do about stained or discolored teeth QUESTION            TAG1  TAG2  TAG2               a:             TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 since teeth whitening has now become the  TAG2 number one TAG2  aesthetic concern of many patients, there are many products and methods available to achieve a brighter smile. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 professional teeth whitening (or bleaching) is a simple, non-invasive dental treatment used to change the color of natural tooth enamel, and is an ideal way to enhance the beauty of your smile.  over-the-counter products are also available, but they are much less effective than professional treatments and may not be approved by the american dental association (ada). TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 as we age, the outer layer of tooth enamel wears away, eventually revealing a darker or yellow shade.  the color of our teeth also comes from the inside of the tooth, which may become darker over time.  smoking, drinking coffee, tea, and wine may also contribute to tooth discoloration, making our teeth yellow and dull.  sometimes, teeth can become discolored from taking certain medications as a child, such as tetracycline.  excessive fluoridation (fluorosis) during tooth development can also cause teeth to become discolored. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 it’s important to have your teeth evaluated by your dentist to determine if you’re a good candidate for bleaching.  occasionally, tetracycline and fluorosis stains are difficult to bleach and your dentist may offer other options, such as veneers or crowns to cover up such stains.  since teeth whitening only works on natural tooth enamel, it is also important to evaluate replacement of any old fillings, crowns, etc. before bleaching begins.  once the bleaching is done, your dentist can match the new restorations to the shade of the newly whitened teeth. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 since teeth whitening is not permanent, a touch-up may be needed every several years to keep your smile looking bright. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the most widely used professional teeth whitening systems: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 home teeth whitening systems:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 at-home products usually come in a gel form that is placed in a custom-fitted mouthguard (tray), created from a mold of your teeth.  the trays are worn either twice a day for approximately 30 minutes, or overnight while you sleep.  it usually takes several weeks to achieve the desired results depending on the degree of staining and the desired level of whitening. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 in office teeth whitening:  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 this treatment is done in the dental office and you will see results immediately.  it may require more than one visit, with each visit lasting 30 to 60 minutes.  while your gums are protected, a bleaching solution is applied to the teeth.  a special light may be used to enhance the action of the agent while the teeth are whitened. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 some patients may experience tooth sensitivity after having their teeth whitened.  this sensation is temporary and subsides shortly after you complete the bleaching process, usually within a few days to one week. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 teeth whitening can be very effective and can give you a brighter, whiter, more confident smile!

TAG1  TAG1 what causes bad breath QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 bad breath is generally a result of dental decay and periodontitis, a disease affecting the gums and bone. periodontitis occurs when the gums become inflamed and infected, ultimately spreading pockets of plaque and tartar from the gums to the bone that supports the teeth. the teeth may become loose and eventually fall out if left untreated. TAG1  TAG1 periodontitis is treatable, but good oral hygiene is the best method of avoiding this problem. TAG1  TAG1 how do i repair a cracked tooth QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 teeth can crack or chip for a variety of reasons. especially if they are subjected to chewing hard foods or biting on an unexpectedly hard object, or if teeth have been subjected to large restorations. TAG1  TAG1 you may also experience painful chewing, unsolicited pain or discomfort due to cold air. TAG1  TAG1 most cracks can be repaired using a simple dental crown. once the crown is placed, the pain usually leaves. for complex cracks that fracture into the tooth pulp, a root canal may be needed before the crown is placed. TAG1  TAG1 is tooth bleaching safe QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 teeth whitening may be one of the best ways to quickly whiten an brighten your smile. TAG1  TAG1 we offer several options for whitening your teeth: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 in-office bleaching- a bleaching solution is applied to your teeth and is activated by heat and light. this in-office procedure typically lasts 30 minutes to one hour and significantly whitens teeth after only one visit. although stubborn stains may require another visit, results generally last for years and can be maximized with regular dental hygiene. TAG2  TAG2 at-home bleaching- during a visit to your dentist, you will be given a whitening gel and fitted with a custom-made whitening tray. once you return home, you apply the gel to the tray and wear it for two to three hours per day for two or three weeks. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 even with today’s advanced whitening techniques, not everyone’s teeth will whiten with the same results. during the visit with your dentist, your situation will be carefully evaluated and you will be advised accordingly. TAG1  TAG1 what are porcelain veneers QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 you can change the shape, color and length of your teeth using veneers. they are thin, durable shells designed to cover the front of the tooth. they are typically made of porcelain and are extremely durable, stain resistant, natural-looking and easy to maintain. TAG1  TAG1 veneers are custom-fitted to your teeth by removing a small amount of enamel and bonding the veneer to your teeth using a safe, high tech polymer resin. you can expect veneers to stay bright and strong for many years by performing good oral hygiene. TAG1  TAG1 why do i need a crown instead of a bigger filling QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 teeth are often restored using silver or composite fillings. however, when too much of a tooth’s structure is removed to support a filling, a crown or “cap” may be needed. a crown may be needed to: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 restore a tooth when it is unable to support a large filling. TAG2  TAG2 attach bridges. TAG2  TAG2 protect a weak tooth from fracturing or restore fractured teeth. TAG2  TAG2 cover badly shaped or discolored teeth. TAG2  TAG2 cover dental implants. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a crown essentially covers a tooth to restore it to its natural shape and size. this permanent covering fits over your original tooth to strengthen or improve the appearance of the tooth. fitting a crown generally requires at least two visits to the dentist’s office. TAG1  TAG1 why should i replace silver-mercury fillings QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 until recently, dentists used an inexpensive silver and mercury amalgam to fill and seal cavities. because silver fillings do not bond to a tooth, a chamber must be cut into the tooth that is larger than the exterior. this “undercut” keeps the filling in the tooth. because a larger amount of the original tooth must be removed, these types of fillings often weaken teeth. TAG1  TAG1 recent innovations now allow us to replace old silver fillings with composite or porcelain fillings that are stronger, safer and more natural looking. unlike silver fillings, composite fillings bond to the tooth and provide more protection from fracturing. the quartz-like material is layered into the tooth and hardened with highly intense visible light.  TAG1  TAG1 the final surface is shaped and polished to match the tooth, making it virtually invisible to the naked eye. say goodbye to “metal mouth” and hello to a beautiful new smile. TAG1  TAG1 what do i do if my tooth is loose or knocked out QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 if the tooth is loose, but still in the socket, leave it in place and see your dentist immediately. if it has been knocked out, pick it up by the crown, not the root. gently rinse, but do not scrub it or attempt to dry it off. if possible, gently push it into the socket or place it in a glass of milk. do not let the tooth dry out! time is of theessence; see a dentist within 30 minutes. TAG1  TAG1 how do i manage dry mouth QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 more seniors today have retained their own teeth, avoiding the trauma of removable dentures. many are on medications creating dryness of the mouth as a side effect. without the natural benefit of saliva to decrease bacterial action, we see an increase of cavities on the root surfaces of these patients. anyone on a medication causing a dry mouth effect should be encouraged to see their dentist for regular dental cleanings and topical fluoride rinses. TAG1  TAG1 what is periodontal disease QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 periodontal (gum) disease is a serious chronic bacterial infection that affects the gums and bones of the mouth. gum disease generally starts when plaque forms around the teeth, inflaming the gums. the gums swell and bleed easily. early stages of gingivitis are reversible with treatment by a dentist. however, untreated gum disease will eventually lead to periodontitis, an infection that moves below the gum line and attacks the tissue and bone supporting the teeth. as the infection progresses, tissue and bone are destroyed, and teeth become loose and must be removed. TAG1  TAG1 the second, third, and fourth stages are initial, moderate, and advanced “periodontal disease”, respectively. these stages are different from gingivitis because the infection has destroyed the bone supporting the teeth, causing eventual tooth loss. the treatment is more involved at these stages, usually consisting of a special cleaning with anesthesia and sometimes gum surgery. periodontal disease can go on for years without pain and without detection unless specific examination procedures are performed. visual oral examination by itself (even by a dentist) will not reliably detect periodontal disease until it has reached an advanced stage. TAG1  TAG1 early detection and adequate diagnosis require measurement of pockets (the crevice between the tooth and gum) with a periodontal probe. effective prevention and treatment is available, but the damage caused as the disease progresses is irreversible. early detection and treatment is critical to prevent tooth loss and disfigurement. TAG1  TAG1 what are dental implants QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 the loss of just a single tooth can set a course that can destroy an entire mouth. teeth will drift and tip into a space that is created by missing teeth. when you lose a tooth, a dental implant may be needed to replace the tooth root and crown. dental implants are simply “anchors” that permanently support replacement teeth. they are secure and durable and can be cleaned and cared for much like your natural teeth. TAG1  TAG1 the procedure requires a titanium root be fitted into your jaw to replace the lost tooth’s root. once the implant is anchored into the bone, the bone around the implant requires six weeks to six months of healing. once the bone has healed, a support post and replacement tooth is anchored onto the implant. TAG1  TAG1 what should i do if i lose a tooth QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 losing a tooth by accident or by extraction is not the end of the matter. when a tooth is missing, the resulting gap will allow nearby teeth to tilt or drift from their normal position, and the teeth above the gap will move downward. aside from the obvious cosmetic problem, the changed positions of these teeth can lead to severe bite problems causing jaw pain and headaches. TAG1  TAG1 missing teeth should be replaced to keep other teeth in their normal position. this can be done by means of a fixed bridge or a dental implant. both of thesetreatments offer a good functional and cosmetic result. TAG1  TAG1 what is tooth decay QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 tooth decay occurs when bacteria in dental plaque damages the enamel of your teeth, leaving a hole or cavity. any part of a tooth can decay, from the roots below the gum line to the chewing surface. if plaque bacteria reach and damage the pulp, the tooth will likely die, because the pulp contains nerves and blood vessels that supply the tooth. tooth decay can occur due to a number of issues, including poor brushing and flossing habits, diets rich in sugar, the presence of risk factors such as smoking and lack of fluoride in the water supply.

TAG1  TAG1 where does tooth decay come from QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 your mouth is home to entire communities of bacteria that are recycling your food and drinks. in the process, these bacteria can cause tooth decay in our mouths – by feeding on the sugars in the foods and drinks we consume to grow – then leaving behind the waste, in the form of a biofilm known as  TAG2 dental plaque TAG2 . this plaque allows all those little recyclers to stick around your teeth longer, until eventually they make acids, which wear down the tooth enamel and cause cavities. the bacteria in the plaque that forms near the gums also produce toxic products that enter the gum tissues, causing gingivitis. if untreated, gingivitis may become periodontitis, a more serious disease where there is bone and tissue loss around the teeth. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 many of the foods you eat cause the bacteria in your mouth to produce acids TAG2 . sugary foods are obvious sources of plaque, but there are others that you might not realize can cause harm. starches—such as bread, crackers, and cereal—also cause acids to form. the dental plaque created from bacteria also produces substances that irritate the gums, making them red, sensitive, and susceptible to bleeding. this can lead to gum disease, in which gums pull away from the teeth and form pockets that fill with bacteria and pus. if the gums are not treated, the bone around the teeth can be destroyed and teeth may become loose or have to be removed. TAG1  TAG1 how can i prevent tooth decay QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 the best way to prevent tooth decay and remove plaque is by  TAG2 brushing and cleaning between your teeth every day TAG2 .  brushing removes plaque from the tooth surfaces. brush your teeth twice per day with a soft-bristled brush. the size and shape of your toothbrush should fit your mouth and allow you to reach all areas easily. use an antimicrobial toothpaste containing fluoride, which helps protect your teeth from decay. clean between the teeth once a day with floss or interdental cleaners to remove plaque from between the teeth, where the toothbrush can't reach. flossing is essential to prevent gum disease. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 did you know tooth decay is actually an infectious disease QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 there are an estimated  TAG2 300 different species of bacteria TAG2  living inside our mouths.  TAG2 many of these bacteria can cause tooth decay and are spreadable just like other infectious diseases. according to the science journal  TAG2 microbiome TAG2  , an otherwise innocent ten-second kiss can spread 80 million bacteria between mouths!

TAG1  TAG1 bacteria near your gumline thrive in a sticky matrix called  TAG2 plaque TAG2 . plaque accumulates, hardens, and migrates down the length of your tooth if it isn’t removed regularly by brushing and flossing. this can inflame your gums and cause the condition known as  TAG2 gingivitis TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 increased inflammation causes your gums to begin to pull away from your teeth. this process creates pockets in which  TAG2 pus TAG2  may eventually collect. this more advanced stage of gum disease is called  TAG2 periodontitis TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 there are many factors that contribute to gingivitis and periodontitis, including: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 neck TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 your dentist might tap or scrape at your teeth with various tools or instruments to assist with a diagnosis. a technician at the dentist’s office will take  TAG2 dental x-rays TAG2  of your mouth, making sure to get an image of each of your teeth. be sure to tell your dentist if you’re pregnant. women who are pregnant shouldn’t have  TAG2 x-rays TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 a tool called a probe can be used to measure your gum pockets. this small ruler can tell your dentist whether or not you have gum disease or receding gums. in a healthy mouth, the depth of the pockets between the teeth are usually between  TAG2 1 and 3 millimeters (mm) TAG2 . any measurement higher than that may mean you have gum disease. TAG1  TAG1 if your dentist finds any abnormal  TAG2 lumps TAG2 , lesions, or  TAG2 growths TAG2  in your mouth, they may perform a  TAG2 gum biopsy TAG2 . during a  TAG2 biopsy TAG2 , a small piece of tissue is removed from the growth or lesion. the sample is then sent to a laboratory for examination under a microscope to check for  TAG2 cancerous cells TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 if  TAG2 oral cancer TAG2  is suspected, your dentist may also order imaging tests to see if the cancer has spread. tests may include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 x-ray TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  types of dental and oraldiseases TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 we use our teeth and mouths for a lot, so it’s not surprising how many things can go wrong over time, especially if you don’t take proper care of your teeth. most dental and oral problems can be prevented with proper oral hygiene. you’ll likely experience at least one dental problem during your lifetime.  TAG1  TAG1 cavities  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cavities TAG2  are also called caries or  TAG2 tooth decay TAG2 . these are areas of the tooth that have been permanently damaged and may even have holes in them. cavities are fairly common. they occur when bacteria, food, and acid coat your teeth and form a plaque. the acid on your teeth starts to eat away at the enamel and then the underlying dentin, or connective tissue. over time, this can lead to permanent damage.  TAG1  TAG1 gum disease (gingivitis) TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 gum disease TAG2 , also called gingivitis, is inflammation of the gums. it’s usually the result of plaque building up on your teeth due to poor brushing and flossing habits. gingivitis can make your gums swell and bleed when you brush or floss. untreated gingivitis can lead to periodontitis, a more serious infection.  TAG1  TAG1 periodontitis TAG1  TAG1 as  TAG2 periodontitis TAG2  progresses, the infection can spread to your jaw and bones. it can also cause an inflammatory response throughout the body.  TAG1  TAG1 cracked or broken teeth TAG1  TAG1 a tooth can  TAG2 crack TAG2  or  TAG2 break TAG2  from an injury to the mouth, chewing hard foods, or  TAG2 grinding the teeth TAG2  at night. a cracked tooth can be very painful. you should visit your dentist right away if you’ve cracked or broken a tooth.  TAG1  TAG1 sensitive teeth TAG1  TAG1 if your teeth are  TAG2 sensitive TAG2 , you might feel pain or discomfort after having cold or hot foods or beverages.  TAG1  TAG1 tooth sensitivity is also referred to as “dentin hypersensitivity.” it sometimes occurs temporarily after having a  TAG2 root canal TAG2  or a  TAG2 filling TAG2 . it can also be the result of: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 gum disease TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 floor of the mouth TAG2  TAG2 hard and soft palate TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a dentist is usually the first person to recognize oral cancer. tobacco use, such as smoking and chewing tobacco, is the biggest  TAG2 risk factor TAG2  for oral cancer.  TAG1  TAG1 according to the  TAG2 oral cancer foundation (ocf) TAG2 , nearly 50,000 americans will be diagnosed with oral cancer this year. in general, the earlier that oral cancer is diagnosed, the better the outlook.  TAG1  TAG1 the link between oral and general health  TAG1  TAG1 oral health has risen in importance in recent years, as researchers have discovered a connection between declining oral health and underlying systemic conditions. it turns out that a healthy mouth can help you maintain a healthy body. according to the mayo clinic, oral bacteria and inflammation may be associated with: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 low birth weight TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 bacteria can spread from your oral cavity to your bloodstream, causing  TAG2 infective endocarditis TAG2 . infective endocarditis is a life-threatening infection of your  TAG2 heart valves TAG2 . your dentist may suggest you take antibiotics as a preventive measure before they perform any dental procedure that could dislodge bacteria in your mouth. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  treatingdental and oral problems TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 even if you’ve been taking good care of your teeth, you’ll still need to have a  TAG2 professional cleaning TAG2  twice a year during a routine visit with your dentist. your dentist will recommend other treatments if you show signs of gum disease, infections, or other problems.  TAG1  TAG1 cleanings TAG1  TAG1 a professional cleaning can get rid of any plaque you may have missed while brushing and flossing. it’ll also remove tartar. these cleanings are usually performed by a dental hygienist. after all the tartar is removed from your teeth, the hygienist will use a high-powered toothbrush to brush your teeth. this is followed by flossing and rinsing to wash out any debris. TAG1  TAG1 a deep cleaning is also known as scaling and root planning. it removes tartar from above and below the gumline that can’t be reached during a routine cleaning.  TAG1  TAG1 fluoride treatments TAG1  TAG1 following a dental cleaning, your dentist may apply a  TAG2 fluoride treatment TAG2  to help fight off cavities. fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral. it can help strengthen the enamel of your tooth and make them more resilient to bacteria and acid. TAG1  TAG1 antibiotics TAG1  TAG1 if you show signs of a gum infection or you have a  TAG2 tooth abscess TAG2  that has spread to other teeth or your jaw, your dentist may prescribe antibiotics to help get rid of the infection. the antibiotic may be in the form of a mouth rinse, gel, oral tablet, or capsule. topical antibiotic gel may also be applied to the teeth or gums during surgical procedures.  TAG1  TAG1 fillings, crowns, and sealants TAG1  TAG1 a filling is used to repair a cavity, crack, or hole in the tooth. the dentist will first use a drill to remove the damaged area of the tooth and then fill the hole with some material, such as amalgam or composite. TAG1  TAG1 a crown is used if a large portion of your tooth needs to be removed or has broken off due to an injury. there are two types of crowns: an implant crown that fits over an implant, and a regular crown that fits over a natural tooth. both types of crowns fill in the gap where your natural tooth appeared.  TAG1  TAG1 dental sealants are thin, protective coatings that are placed on the back teeth, or  TAG2 molars TAG2 , to help prevent cavities. your dentist may recommend a sealant for your children as soon as they get their first molars, at around age six, and again when they get their second set of molars around age 12. sealants are easy to apply and completely painless.  TAG1  TAG1 root canal TAG1  TAG1 you might need a  TAG2 root canal TAG2  if tooth decay reaches all the way inside the tooth to the nerve. during a root canal, the nerve is removed and replaced with a filling made of a biocompatible material, usually a combination of a rubber-like material called gutta-percha and adhesive cement. TAG1  TAG1 probiotics TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 probiotics TAG2  are mostly known for their role in  TAG2 digestive health TAG2 , but new research has shown that the healthy bacteria may be beneficial for your teeth and gums. TAG1  TAG1 probiotics have been shown to prevent plaque and treat bad breath. they also help to prevent oral cancers and decrease inflammation from gum disease. TAG1  TAG1 while large clinical trials are still needed to prove their effectiveness,  TAG2 results to date TAG2  have been promising. you can take a probiotic supplement or eat  TAG2 foods high in beneficial bacteria TAG2 , such as  TAG2 yogurt TAG2 ,  TAG2 kefir TAG2 , and  TAG2 kimchi TAG2 . other popular probiotic foods include  TAG2 sauerkraut TAG2 ,  TAG2 tempeh TAG2 , and  TAG2 miso TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG1 changing daily habits TAG1  TAG1 keeping your mouth healthy is a  TAG2 daily commitment TAG2 . a dental hygienist can teach you how to properly take care of your teeth and gums on a daily basis. in addition to brushing and flossing, your daily routine can include mouthwash, oral rinses, and possibly other tools, such as a  TAG2 waterpik  TAG2 water flosser.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 oral surgeries TAG2  are usually performed to treat more serious cases of periodontal disease. certain dental surgeries can also be done to replace or fix missing or broken teeth caused by an accident.  TAG1  TAG1 flap surgery TAG1  TAG1 during a flap surgery, a surgeon makes a small cut in the gum to lift up a section of the tissue. they then remove tartar and bacteria from underneath the gums. the flap is then stitched back into place around your teeth. TAG1  TAG1 bone grafting TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 bone grafting TAG2  is needed when gum disease causes damage to the bone surrounding the root of your tooth. the dentist replaces the damaged bone with a graft, which can be made from your own bone, a synthetic bone, or a donated bone.  TAG1  TAG1 soft tissue grafts TAG1  TAG1 a  TAG2 soft tissue graft TAG2  is used to treat receding gums. a dentist will remove a small piece of tissue from your mouth or use a donor tissue and attach it to the areas of your gums that are missing.  TAG1  TAG1 tooth extraction TAG1  TAG1 if your dentist can’t save your tooth with a root canal or other surgery, the tooth will likely need to be extracted. TAG1  TAG1 you may also need a  TAG2 tooth extraction TAG2  if your  TAG2 wisdom teeth TAG2 , or third molars, are  TAG2 impacted TAG2 . sometimes, a person’s jaw isn’t large enough to accommodate the third set of molars. one or more of the wisdom teeth will become trapped or impacted when it tries to emerge. a dentist will typically recommend that wisdom teeth be extracted if they cause pain, inflammation, or other problems. TAG1  TAG1 dental implants TAG1  TAG1 dental implants are used to replace missing teeth that are lost due to a disease or an accident. an implant is surgically placed into the jawbone. after the implant is placed, your bones will grow around it. this is called osseointegration.  TAG1  TAG1 once this process is complete, your dentist will customize a new artificial tooth for you that matches your other teeth. this artificial tooth is known as a crown. the new crown is then attached to the implant. if you’re replacing more than one tooth, your dentist may customize a bridge to fit into your mouth. a dental bridge is made of two abutment crowns on either side of the gap, which then hold the artificial teeth in between in place.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 periodontal disease can eventually break down the bone that supports your teeth. this can lead to many complications. you’ll likely need dental treatment to save your teeth. TAG1  TAG1 risks and complications of untreated periodontal disease include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 tooth abscesses  TAG2  TAG2 tooth loss TAG2  TAG2 increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and respiratory diseases TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if left untreated, an infection from a tooth abscess can spread to other parts of your head or neck. it can even lead to  TAG2 sepsis TAG2 , a life-threatening blood infection. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 good oral health boils down to good general health and common sense. the best ways to prevent oral health problems are to: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste at least twice a day TAG2  TAG2 floss at least once a day (one of the most beneficial things you can do to prevent disease in your oral cavity) TAG2  TAG2 have your teeth cleaned by a dental professional every six months TAG2  TAG2 follow a  TAG2 high-fiber TAG2 , low-fat,  TAG2 low-sugar diet TAG2  that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables TAG2  TAG2 limit sugary snacks and drinks TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 foods with hidden sugars include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 condiments such as ketchup and barbecue sauce TAG2  TAG2 sliced fruit or applesauce in cans or jars that have added sugars TAG2  TAG2 flavored yogurt TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  what you should know about yourchild’s oral health TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2 american academy of pediatrics (aap) TAG2  recommends that children start seeing a dentist by their first birthday. TAG1  TAG1 children are highly susceptible to dental cavities and tooth decay, especially those who bottle feed. cavities may be caused by too much sugar left on the teeth after bottle feeding.  TAG1  TAG1 to avoid  TAG2 baby bottle tooth decay TAG2 , you should do the following: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 only bottle feed during meal times TAG2  TAG2 wean your child off of a bottle by the time they’re one year old TAG2  TAG2 fill the bottle with water if you must give them a bottle at bedtime TAG2  TAG2 begin brushing with a soft baby toothbrush once their baby teeth start to come in; you should use only water until your child learns not to swallow the toothpaste  TAG2  TAG2 start seeing a pediatric dentist regularly for your child TAG2  TAG2 ask your child’s dentist about dental sealants  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  what men need to know about oralhealth TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 according to the  TAG2 american academy of periodontology TAG2 , men are less likely to take good care of their teeth and gums than women. compared to women, men are less likely to brush twice per day, floss regularly, and seek preventive dental care. TAG1  TAG1 oral and  TAG2 throat TAG2  cancer is more common in men. a 2008  TAG2 study TAG2  showed that men with a history of periodontal disease are 14 percent more likely to develop other types of cancer than men with healthy gums. it’s important that men recognize the consequences of poor oral health and take action early in life.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 due to changing hormones at various stages of their lives,  TAG2 women are at risk TAG2  for several oral health issues. TAG1  TAG1 when a woman first starts menstruating, she may experience mouth sores or swollen gums during her periods.  TAG1  TAG1 during pregnancy, increased hormones can affect the amount of saliva produced by the mouth. frequent vomiting caused by  TAG2 morning sickness TAG2  can result in tooth decay. you can receive dental care during pregnancy, but you should let your dentist know if you’re pregnant.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  what people with diabetes need toknow about oral health TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 diabetes TAG2  affects the body’s ability to fight off bacteria. this means that people with diabetes have a higher risk of having oral infections, gum disease, and periodontitis. they’re at an increased risk of an oral fungal infection called  TAG2 thrush TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 for people with diabetes to take charge of their oral health, they’ll need to maintain control over their  TAG2 blood sugar levels TAG2 . this is on top of brushing, flossing, and dentist’s visits.

TAG2  TAG2 eat a variety of foods from each of the five major food groups, including:     TAG2  TAG2 whole grains  TAG2  TAG2 fruits  TAG2  TAG2 vegetables  TAG2  TAG2 lean sources of protein such as lean beef, skinless poultry and fish; dry beans, peas and other legumes  TAG2  TAG2 low-fat and fat-free dairy foods  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 limit the number of snacks you eat. if you do snack, choose something that is healthy like fruit or vegetables or a piece of cheese. foods that are eaten as part of a meal cause less harm to teeth than eating lots of snacks throughout the day, because more saliva is released during a meal. saliva helps wash foods from the mouth and lessens the effects of acids, which can harm teeth and cause cavities. for good dental health, always remember to brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste that has the american dental association seal of acceptance, floss daily and visit your dentist regularly. with regular dental care, your dentist can help prevent oral problems from occurring in the first place and catch those that do occur in the early stages, while they are easy to treat.

TAG1  TAG1 most oral diseases and conditions share modifiable risk factors with the leading ncds (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes). these risk factors include tobacco use, alcohol consumption and unhealthy diets high in free sugars, all of which are increasing at the global level. there is a proven relationship between oral and general health. it is reported, for example, that diabetes mellitus is linked with the development and progression of periodontitis. moreover, there is a causal link between high sugars consumption and diabetes, obesity and dental caries. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2                         impact                     TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 poor oral health causes millions of people to suffer from devastating pain and increases the out-of-pocket financial burden for society. oral diseases can affect an individual’s effectiveness in school and work settings and can cause social and personal problems. the psychosocial impact of many oral diseases significantly reduces the quality of life.  TAG1  TAG1 while the global burden of untreated dental caries for primary and permanent dentition has remained relatively unchanged over the past 30 years, the overall burden of oral conditions on services is likely to keep increasing because of population growth and ageing. TAG1  TAG1 oral diseases disproportionally affect the poor and socially-disadvantaged members of society. there is a very strong and consistent association between socioeconomic status (income, occupation and educational level) and the prevalence and severity of oral diseases. this association remains across the life course, from early childhood to older age, and across populations in high-, middle- and low-income countries.  TAG1  TAG1 oral care treatment is costly, averaging 20% of out-of-pocket health expenditure in most high-income countries. the demand for oral health care is beyond the capacity of health care systems in most low- and middle-income countries, and many people in some high-income countries lack financial means to access proper care. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2                         prevention and response                     TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in 2015, the tokyo declaration on dental care and oral health for healthy longevity was adopted. this calls upon health policy makers and professionals to significantly reduce the global burden of disease related to oral health, to promote greater access and equity in oral health services, and to integrate oral health programs into the larger development agenda. TAG1  TAG1 advocacy is needed to give greater prominence of oral health on the global health agenda and therefore contributing to prevention and control of ncds and achievement of uhc. reducing oral health issues calls for a reform of dental care systems to shift the focus from invasive dental treatment, which has failed to combat the global challenge of oral diseases, to minimal invasive treatment and oral diseases prevention. stronger policies are needed to address the determinants of oral diseases and ncds and to tackle inequalities through inclusive universal health care access. TAG1  TAG1 who has identified key strategies for increasing oral health, with a focus on poor and marginalized populations where access to oral health care is most limited. these include strengthening  both cost-effective population-wide prevention and patient centred primary care, common risk factors reduction and oral health promotion. TAG1  TAG1 the who oral health programme is currently implementing a three-year roadmap (2019–2021) comprising a mix of normative work and practical support to countries over five priority activities aligned to the gpw13. one of the top priority is to develop the who global oral health report (one of a who global public health goods) as a robust advocacy document to reinforce the commitment to oral health among policymakers, and to pave the way for the further development of a global oral health action plan towards 2030.

TAG1  TAG1 researchers are also discovering new reasons to brush and floss. a healthy mouth may help you ward off medical disorders. the flip side QUESTION  an unhealthy mouth, especially if you have gum disease, may increase your risk of serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, poorly controlled diabetes and preterm labor. TAG1  TAG1 the case for good oral hygiene keeps getting stronger. understand the importance of oral health — and its connection to your overall health. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what's in your mouth reveals much about your health TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 what does the health of your mouth have to do with your overall health QUESTION  in a word, plenty. a look inside or a swab of saliva can tell your doctor volumes about what's going on inside your body. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 many conditions cause oral signs and symptoms TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 your mouth is a window into what's going on in the rest of your body, often serving as a helpful vantage point for detecting the early signs and symptoms of systemic disease — a disease that affects or pertains to your entire body, not just one of its parts. systemic conditions such as aids or diabetes, for example, often first become apparent as mouth lesions or other oral problems. in fact, according to the academy of general dentistry, more than 90 percent of all systemic diseases produce oral signs and symptoms. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 diabetes TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 saliva: helpful diagnostic tool TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 your doctor can collect and test saliva to detect for a variety of substances. for example, cortisol levels in saliva are used to test for stress responses in newborn children. and fragments of certain bone-specific proteins may be useful in monitoring bone loss in women and men prone to osteoporosis. certain cancer markers are also detectable in saliva. TAG1  TAG1 routine saliva testing can also measure illegal drugs, environmental toxins, hormones and antibodies indicating hepatitis or hiv infection, among other things. in fact, the ability to detect hiv-specific antibodies has led to the production of commercial, easy-to-use saliva test kits. in the future, saliva testing may replace blood testing as a means of diagnosing and monitoring diseases such as diabetes, parkinson's disease, cirrhosis of the liver and many infectious diseases. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 protection against harmful invaders: how saliva disables bacteria and viruses TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 saliva is also one of your body's main defenses against disease-causing organisms, such as bacteria and viruses. it contains antibodies that attack viral pathogens, such as the common cold and hiv. and it contains proteins called histatins, which inhibit the growth of a naturally occurring fungus called  TAG2 candida albicans TAG2 . when these proteins are weakened by hiv infection or other illness, candida can grow out of control, resulting in a fungal infection called oral thrush. TAG1  TAG1 saliva also protects you against disease-causing bacteria. it contains enzymes that destroy bacteria in different ways, by degrading bacterial membranes, inhibiting the growth and metabolism of certain bacteria, and disrupting vital bacterial enzyme systems. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the problem with dental plaque: links to infections and diseases TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 though your saliva helps protect you against some invaders, it can't always do the job. more than 500 species of bacteria thrive in your mouth at any given time. these bacteria constantly form dental plaque — a sticky, colorless film that can cling to your teeth and cause health problems. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 your mouth as infection source TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 if you don't brush and floss regularly to keep your teeth clean, plaque can build up along your gumline, creating an environment for additional bacteria to accumulate in the space between your gums and your teeth. this gum infection is known as gingivitis. left unchecked, gingivitis can lead to a more serious gum infection called periodontitis. the most severe form of gum infection is called acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, also known as trench mouth. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 trench mouth TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 bacteria from your mouth normally don't enter your bloodstream. however, invasive dental treatments — sometimes even just routine brushing and flossing if you have gum disease — can provide a port of entry for these microbes. medications or treatments that reduce saliva flow and antibiotics that disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in your mouth can also compromise your mouth's normal defenses, allowing these bacteria to enter your bloodstream. TAG1  TAG1 if you have a healthy immune system, the presence of oral bacteria in your bloodstream causes no problems. your immune system quickly dispenses with them, preventing infection. however, if your immune system is weakened, for example because of a disease or cancer treatment, oral bacteria in your bloodstream (bacteremia) may cause you to develop an infection in another part of your body. infective endocarditis, in which oral bacteria enter your bloodstream and stick to the lining of diseased heart valves, is an example of this phenomenon. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 endocarditis TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 plaque as cause of common conditions QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 long-term gum infection can eventually result in the loss of your teeth. but the consequences may not end there. recent research suggests that there may be an association between oral infections — primarily gum infections — and poorly controlled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and preterm birth. more research is needed to determine whether oral infections actually cause these conditions, which include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 poorly controlled diabetes. TAG2  if you have diabetes, you're already at increased risk of developing gum disease. but chronic gum disease may, in fact, make diabetes more difficult to control, as well. infection may cause insulin resistance, which disrupts blood sugar control. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 cardiovascular disease. TAG2  oral inflammation due to bacteria (gingivitis) may also play a role in clogged arteries and blood clots. it appears that bacteria in the mouth may cause inflammation throughout the body, including the arteries. this inflammation may serve as a base for development of atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries, possibly increasing your risk of a heart attack or stroke. some research suggests that people with gum infections are also at increased risk of heart attack and stroke. the more severe the infection, the greater the risk appears to be. and gum disease and tooth loss may contribute to plaques in the carotid artery. in one study, 46 percent of participants who'd lost up to nine teeth had carotid artery plaque; among those who'd lost 10 or more teeth, 60 percent of them had such plaque. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 preterm birth. TAG2  severe gum disease may increase the risk of preterm delivery and giving birth to a low birth weight baby. the national institute of dental and craniofacial research, in fact, estimates that as many as 18 percent of preterm, low birth weight babies born in the united states each year may be attributed to oral infections. the theory is that oral bacteria release toxins, which reach the placenta through the mother's bloodstream and interfere with the growth and development of the fetus. at the same time, the oral infection causes the mother to produce labor-triggering substances too quickly, potentially triggering premature labor and birth. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 dental care and diabetes: the importance of a healthy mouth TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a compelling case for good habits TAG1  TAG1 if you didn't already have enough reasons to take good care of your mouth, teeth and gums, the relationship between your oral health and your overall health provides even more. resolve to practice good oral hygiene every day. you're making an investment in your overall health, not just for now, but for the future, too.

TAG2  TAG2 [1] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [2] TAG2  TAG2  dental public health is involved in the assessment of key dental health needs and coming up with effective solutions to improve the dental health of populations rather than individuals. TAG2  TAG2 [3] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 prevention is becoming increasingly important. dental related diseases are largely preventable and there is a growing burden on health care systems for cure. dental public health looks beyond the role of a dental practitioner in treating dental disease, and seeks to reduce demand on health care systems by redirection of resources to priority areas. TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  countries around the world all face similar issues in relation to dental disease. implementation of policies and principles vary due to available of resources. similar to   TAG2 public health TAG2 , an understanding of the many factors that influence  TAG2 health TAG2  will assist the implementation of effective strategies. TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 public health dentistry, is practiced generally through government sponsored programs, which are for the most part directed toward public-school children in the belief that their education in  TAG2 oral hygiene TAG2  is the best way to reach the general public. the pattern for such programs in the past was a dental practitioners annual visit to a school to lecture and to demonstrate proper tooth-brushing techniques. the 1970s saw the emergence of a more elaborate program that included a week of one-hour sessions of instruction, demonstration, and questions and answers, conducted by a dentist and a dental assistant and aided by a teacher who had previously been given several hours of instruction. use was also made of televised dental health education programs, which parents were encouraged to observe.

TAG2  TAG2 [6] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 dental decay TAG2  is however easily prevented by reducing  TAG2 acid TAG2  demineralisation caused by the remaining  TAG2 dental plaque TAG2  left on teeth after brushing. risk factors for  TAG2 tooth decay TAG2  include physical, biological, environmental, behavioural, and lifestyle-related factors such as high numbers of cariogenic  TAG2 bacteria TAG2 , inadequate salivary flow, insufficient  TAG2 fluoride TAG2  exposure, poor  TAG2 oral hygiene TAG2 , inappropriate methods of feeding infants, and poverty. TAG2  TAG2 [7] TAG2  TAG2  neutralising acids after eating and at least twice a day brushing with fluoridated toothpaste will assist prevention. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cavities TAG2  can develop on any surface of a  TAG2 tooth TAG2 , but are most common inside the pits and fissures in grooves on chewing surfaces. this is where the toothbrush bristles and  TAG2 fluoride TAG2  toothpaste cannot reach effectively. TAG2  TAG2 [8] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 gum diseases  TAG2 gingivitis TAG2  and  TAG2 periodontitis TAG2  are caused by certain types of  TAG2 bacteria TAG2  that accumulate in remaining  TAG2 dental plaque TAG2 . the extent of  TAG2 gum disease TAG2  depends a lot on host susceptibility. TAG2  TAG2 [9] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 daily brushing must include brushing of both the  TAG2 teeth TAG2  and  TAG2 gums TAG2 . effective brushing itself, will prevent progression of both  TAG2 dental decay TAG2  and  TAG2 gum diseases TAG2 . neutralising acids after eating and at least twice a day brushing with  TAG2 fluoridated TAG2  toothpaste will assist preventing  TAG2 dental decay TAG2 . stimulating  TAG2 saliva TAG2  flow assists in the  TAG2 remineralisation TAG2  process of  TAG2 teeth TAG2 , this can be done by chewing sugar free gum. TAG2  TAG2 [7] TAG2  TAG2  using an interdental device once daily will assist prevention of  TAG2 gum diseases TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [9] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 fissure sealants TAG2  applied over the chewing surfaces of  TAG2 teeth TAG2 , block  TAG2 plaque TAG2  from being trapped inside pits and fissures. the sealants make brushing more effective and prevent acid demineralisation and  TAG2 tooth decay TAG2 .

TAG2  TAG2 [14] TAG2  TAG2  fluoride has the ability to interfere with the demineralisation and remineralisation process that occurs on the tooth surface and improves the mineral intake when the ph level may reduce below the neutral ph level. TAG2  TAG2 [15] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 this achievement was implemented through the public health development in the 19th, 20th century and led into the 21st century. research into the effects of  TAG2 fluoride TAG2  on  TAG2 teeth TAG2  began due to the concern about the presence of  TAG2 dental fluorosis TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [16] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 many clinical case trials occurred in the beginning of the 20th century. however, the very first clinical trial to have occurred dates back to the 19th century when denninger conducted a trial prescribing children and pregnant women with  TAG2 calcium fluoride TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [15] TAG2  TAG2  from this trial it was recognised  TAG2  fluoride’s TAG2  significance on  TAG2 tooth tissue TAG2  and from this point, many clinical trials were conducted  TAG2  TAG2 [14] TAG2  TAG2 following these studies, the recognition of the positive outcome on dental tissues became clear and projects in water fluoridation became of significant importance. TAG1  TAG1 the development of artificial  TAG2 water fluoridation TAG2  began in 1945 in the grand rapid michigan followed by newburgh, new york and evanston, illinois. TAG2  TAG2 [17] TAG2  TAG2  in 1955 three towns watford, kilmarnock and anglesey trialled the water fluoridation implementation scheme. TAG2  TAG2 [14] TAG2  TAG2  in 1960 the republic of ireland implemented all public water supplies with artificial fluoridated water and four years later extending this into the main cities of dublin and cork. TAG2  TAG2 [14] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 currently, 40 countries have fluoridated water schemes implemented.  TAG2 fluoride TAG2  is still yet to be completely implemented across the full population however, progress is slowly improving and access is becoming more common.

TAG2  TAG2 [19] TAG2  TAG2  this education can be focused towards dental practitioners and to the wider population who may interested. TAG1  TAG1 there has been a change in focus in the education of developing clinicians all over the world. the first dental school was developed in 1828  TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  and was followed by an ever-growing field of practice. the dental practice began with its main focus on the treatment of oral disease and branched into a wide scope of practice with many dental occupations involved. TAG1  TAG1 the most common form of dental clinicians are either general  TAG2 dentists TAG2 , oral health therapists,  TAG2 dental therapists TAG2  and  TAG2 dental hygienist TAG2 . when desired, some of these clinicians may seek further experience in projects that may assist the dental public system in bringing further awareness to prevention of dental diseases. TAG2  TAG2 [21] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 oral health prevention is the current form of practice of many clinicians. as education in oral care to the population is now believed to be the superior solution rather than the treatment of disease. dental university education now develops clinicians to focus on the education of patients, education of the community and a wider population using different approaches. TAG2  TAG2 [19] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 approaches to promotion TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2 edit TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 oral health promotion outlines the strategies for improving and educating the general public about how they can better take improve and maintain their current oral health. oral health promotion is part of both government and private incentives to create a healthier and better educated generation of individuals. TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 these are the nine key principles involved for oral health promotion:  TAG2  TAG2 [23] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 empowerment TAG2  TAG2 individuals, groups and communities are given the ability to exercise more control over the personal, socioeconomics, and environmental factors through interventions that affect their oral health. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 participatory TAG2  TAG2 key stakeholders that are invested in the intervention program should be actively participating in the stages of planning, implementing and evaluating interventions. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 holistic TAG2  TAG2 common risks and conditions of oral health, general health and inequalities should be taken into consideration of a broad intervention approach. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 inter-sectoral TAG2  TAG2 collaboration between all relevant agencies and sectors is paramount as it allows oral health improvement to be implemented upon the wider public health agenda. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 equity TAG2  TAG2 it is important to place an emphasis on oral health inequalities when planning interventions for oral health improvement. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 evidence base TAG2  TAG2 future interventions of oral health improvement should be implemented through existing knowledge of effectiveness and good practice of oral health. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 sustainable TAG2  TAG2 the measures of whether individuals, groups and communities of achieving long-term oral health improvement can be maintained. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 multi-strategy TAG2  TAG2 it is imperative to perform a range of complementary actions such as health public policies, community development and environmental change in order to address the underlying determinants of oral health. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 evaluation TAG2  TAG2 adequate resources in conjunction with suitable methods should be present for effective assessment of oral health interventions. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 there are three important way in achieving oral health promotion, which is done by addressing the determinants of oral health, community participation, and implementing a strategy approach that involves a range of complementary actions. TAG2  TAG2 [23] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 determinants of oral health TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2 edit TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 oral health promotion focuses on individual behaviour, the  TAG2 socioeconomic status TAG2  and environmental factors. underlying determinants that can also impact oral health, including non-milk extrinsic sugars consumption, alcohol consumption and smoking behaviour. TAG2  TAG2 [23] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the ability to remove  TAG2 dental plaque TAG2 , exposure to  TAG2 fluoride TAG2  and access to quality dental care can affect the ways the aforementioned underlying factors are and can be modified to the needs of the individual to obtain optimum oral health. TAG2  TAG2 [23] TAG2  TAG2  ways in which oral health promotion can minimise the effects of these determinants; TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 promoting healthy eating. TAG2  TAG2 teaching effective oral hygiene practices. TAG2  TAG2 promoting the use of topical fluoride for preventing and control of  TAG2 dental caries TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 facilitating early access to preventative dental services. TAG2  TAG2 [24] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 it is also important to note that these factors are also influenced by socio-political considerations that are outside the control of most individuals. TAG2  TAG2 [23] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 community participation is a key factor in oral health promotion. inter-sectoral collaboration is where relevant agencies and sectors are involved in partnership to identify key oral health issues and to implement new methods to improve oral health. TAG2  TAG2 [23] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2 world health organization TAG2  has agreed on a health promotion approach as the foundation for oral health improvement strategies and policies for the population. oral health promotion is based on the principles of the framework,  TAG2 ottawa charter TAG2 . there are five areas of action outlined to achieve oral health promotion; building health public policy, creating supportive environment, strengthening community action, developing personal skills, re-orienting healthcare services.

TAG2  TAG2 [25] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 another study on the effects of oral health educational interventions for nursing home staff or residents, or both, to maintain or improve the oral health for nursing home residents shows insufficient supporting evidence.

TAG1  TAG1 dental benefits for children in medicaid TAG1  TAG1 medicaid covers dental services for all child enrollees as part of a comprehensive set of benefits, referred to as the  TAG2 early and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment (epsdt) benefit TAG2 . though oral screening may be part of a physical exam, it does not substitute for a dental examination performed by a dentist. a referral to a dentist is required for every child in accordance with the periodicity schedule set by a state. TAG1  TAG1 dental services for children must minimally include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 relief of pain and infections TAG2  TAG2 restoration of teeth TAG2  TAG2 maintenance of dental health TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the epsdt benefit requires that all services must be provided if determined medically necessary. states determine medical necessity. if a condition requiring treatment is discovered during a screening, the state must provide the necessary services to treat that condition, whether or not such services are included in a state's medicaid plan. TAG1  TAG1 each state is required to develop a dental periodicity schedule in consultation with recognized dental organizations involved in child health care. dental services may not be limited to emergency services for children entitled to epsdt. TAG1  TAG1 dental services must be provided at intervals that meet reasonable standards of dental practice, and at such other intervals, as indicated by medical necessity, to determine the existence of a suspected illness or condition. states must consult with recognized dental organizations involved in child health care to establish those intervals. a referral to a dentist is required for every child in accordance with each state's periodicity schedule and at other intervals as medically necessary. the periodicity schedule for other epsdt services may not govern the schedule for dental services. TAG1  TAG1 dental benefits for children in chip TAG1  TAG1 states that provide chip coverage to children through a medicaid expansion program are required to provide the epsdt benefit.  dental coverage in separate chip programs is required to include coverage for dental services &quot;necessary to prevent disease and promote oral health, restore oral structures to health and function, and treat emergency conditions.&quot; TAG1  TAG1 states with a  TAG2 separate chip TAG2  program may choose from two options for providing dental coverage: a package of dental benefits that meets the chip requirements, or a benchmark dental benefit package. the benchmark dental package must be substantially equal to the (1) the most popular federal employee dental plan for dependents, (2) the most popular plan selected for dependants in the state's employee dental plan, or (3) dental coverage offered through the most popular commercial insurer in the state. TAG1  TAG1 states are also required to post a listing of all participating medicaid and chip dental providers and benefit packages on  TAG2 insurekidsnow.gov TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 dental benefits for adults in medicaid TAG1  TAG1 states have flexibility to determine what dental benefits are provided to adult medicaid enrollees. while most states provide at least emergency dental services for adults, less than half of the states currently provide comprehensive dental care. there are no minimum requirements for adult dental coverage. TAG1  TAG1 children's oral health initiative TAG1  TAG1 the centers for medicare &amp; medicaid services (cms) is committed to improving access to dental and oral health services for children enrolled in medicaid and chip. we have been making considerable  TAG2 progress TAG2  (pdf, 303.79 kb) in our efforts to ensure that low-income children have access to oral health care. from 2007 to 2011, almost half of all states (24) achieved at least a ten percentage point increase in the proportion of children enrolled in medicaid and chip that received a preventive dental service during the reporting year. yet, tooth decay remains one of the most common chronic childhood diseases. TAG1  TAG1 to support continued progress, in 2010 cms launched the children's oral health initiative and set  TAG2 goals TAG2  (pdf, 283 kb) for improvement by ffy 2015. to achieve those goals, we have adopted a  TAG2 national oral health strategy TAG2  through which we are working diligently with states and federal partners, as well as the dental provider community, children's advocates and other stakeholders to improve children's access to dental care. TAG1  TAG1 to support state medicaid and chip programs in achieving their improvement goals, we developed  TAG2 keep kids smiling: promoting oral health through the medicaid benefit for children and adolescents TAG2  (pdf, 578.09 kb) (pdf, 578.09 kb). it provides an overview of the children's dental benefit in medicaid, support for evidence-based policies at the state level, and details of successful strategies with state examples.   TAG1  TAG1 we are also ramping up our efforts to educate consumers, health care providers and the public about positive oral health practices. three  TAG2 oral health education materials TAG2 , with messaging targeted to parents of young children and to pregnant women, are available for download or bulk order. also available are tips for using the materials.

TAG1  TAG1 sohaps may be submitted using either a cms-developed oral health action plan template or a  TAG2 user-friendly template TAG2  developed by the medicaid-chip state dental association. completed sohaps may be submitted to andrew snyder, health insurance specialist via email to  TAG2 andrew.snyder@cms.hhs.gov TAG2  with a copy to your cms regional office contact. any questions about the sohaps may also be directed to mr. snyder.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 march 17, 2020 — american public health association oral health section statement on covid-19 TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 as members of the american public health association oral health section, we are committed to making science and facts available to our colleagues in the oral health profession and promoting public health. during the time of covid-19, this is especially true.  based on currently available information about covid-19 and consistent with the  TAG2 centers for disease control and prevention TAG2   and the  TAG2 american dental association TAG2 , the oral health section of apha advises all dental offices and clinics to voluntarily limit dental care to emergencies and urgent situations only.  based on the current situation of covid-19 in the united states and the high risk for transmission in a dental setting, this is the best way to protect our dental health care workers and our communities.  we recognize that this will likely result in financial hardship, but this preemptive measure will give us all a better chance of preventing a longer, more severe financial hardship. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 current cdc guidelines TAG2  advise postponing non-emergency or elective dental procedures for patients with signs or symptoms of respiratory illness. since the transmission of the coronavirus (covid-19) is thought to occur among  TAG2 asymptomatic cases TAG2 , it would be reasonable to postpone all non-emergency treatment to prevent unintentional exposure to the dental team and their families. TAG1  TAG1 additionally,  TAG2 current cdc guidelines TAG2  recommend the use of an n95 respirator when performing an aerosol-generating procedure on a patient with suspected covid-19.  TAG2 standard precautions TAG2  TAG2  for a dental setting would dictate that we assume all dental patients have covid-19. therefore, the use of an n95 mask would be indicated for all aerosol-generating procedures. the healthcare industry is currently experiencing a  TAG2  TAG2 shortage of n95 masks TAG2  TAG2 , and it would be irresponsible for dental providers to use up scarce resources on elective non-emergency procedures. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 we understand this is an evolving situation. we encourage all dental providers to view the cdc  TAG2 covid-19 situation TAG2  and their local health department webpage regularly for current recommendations. we have every confidence in our dental community’s ability to make these clinical decisions with kindness, courage, and concern for the common good of our communities.

TAG2 if you are not sure if your condition qualifies check by  TAG2 clicking here. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how often do i have to be seen QUESTION  about every six months. (followup visit $149) TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 new patients are seen for a new patient consult, and when they qualify are placed into the state registry that same day. this begins your medical marijuana card. when you receive your card (about a month later), you return to the office for a ‘prescribing visit’ to discuss medication doses, routes and medicine types, and receive your marijuana recommendation. medicine cannot be given to patients over the phone. when the patient has reached a comfortable level of use and there are no other contraindications,  TAG2 we see the patient back in the office every six months and follow-up visits cost $149 TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 medical marijuana is a control i substance and needs close oversight. patients that have a complex medical history, significant heart disease, a history of heavy narcotic use or other controlled substances, a prior addiction history, a high overdose score on eforce, or extremes of age (the very young and the very old) may need to be seen on a more frequent basis. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 ok, i have a qualifying condition, how do i make an appointment QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 before requesting an appointment, you must read this entire faq page. then, if you have a qualifying condition above, the fastest way to schedule an appointment by simply clicking on the following link:  TAG2 make appointment TAG2  or you may email us at:  TAG2 doctor@med-can.com TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do i need to have a referral to the medcan office QUESTION  no referral is needed. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 you do not need a referral to have an appointment with medcan. however, you will need to have a previous diagnosis as listed above, and been treated by a physician or specialist for such condition.  medcan doctor’s office requires patient provide copies of their medical record to support their diagnosis. to facilitate your certification, go to your doctor’s office and at a minimum, get a copy of your medical summary, and recent office visit, with your diagnosis. bring this with you to your medcan appointment. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i have chronic pain and i’m on pain pills, so i qualify, right QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 not really, but maybe—if you have cancer or another qualifying condition that is causing the pain. florida statute 381.986 says: “chronic nonmalignant pain” means pain that is  TAG2 caused by a qualifying medical condition TAG2  or  TAG2 that originates from a qualifying medical condition TAG2  and persists beyond the usual course of that qualifying medical condition. so therefore, if you have chronic pain, but it’s not caused from a qualifying condition, you don’t qualify. and if you already have a qualifying condition (and it causes pain), you’d qualify anyway. chronic pain by itself is not a qualifying condition. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what records are needed to be brought in for my office visit QUESTION    TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 we need supporting records of your diagnosis which will certify you. usually the most recent office visit from your primary or specialist treating physician will have a summary of your diagnosis and treatments up to date for your indicated condition. bring a copy of your medical summary with you to your medcan appointment. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 once i am seen at medcan doctors office, can i see you as my primary and get all my prescriptions from medcan  QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 no, you may not. you must continue to see your primary doctor and family physician. medcan is not a pain clinic nor does it provide primary care services. we do not prescribe sedatives, opiates, or any other medicines. our focus is to help patients access medical cannabis under florida law. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 where is the medcan doctor’s office located QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 our tallahassee office is located on  TAG2 capital medical ct TAG2  near capital regional hospital. medcan florida 1849 capital medical ct. tallahassee, fl 32308 TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 does the medcan doctors office accept insurance for office visits QUESTION     TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 no. there are no insurance carriers that pay for medical marijuana related services or medicines. we do accept all debit and credit cards, and offer discounts for cash, checks and money orders. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i heard california does office visits on the phone and telemedicine. is this allowed in florida QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 no. telemedicine is not allowed for medical marijuana in florida. to protect its citizens, florida law does not allow telemedicine for controlled substances.  medical marijuana is a federal “controlled substance”.  it makes good sense that the intent of the law would not allow a physician-patient relationship for controlled substances to be carried out on the phone, because controlled substances like medical marijuana are highly regulated.  while there are some doctors advertising “phone visits”, do not subscribe to this.  TAG2   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is it safe to sign up with companies that schedule me with traveling doctors QUESTION    TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 probably not. we have heard patients tell us they have paid money to companies on the phone, and never received their doctor visit, or their card. there are advertisements online where a company says they will give patients medicine for a year, but after the patient signs up, they do not hear back from the doctors and no one answers their phone calls. TAG1  TAG1 dr mark moore and medcan are located in the same office location since opening in tallahassee. we are now approaching the start of our 5 TAG2 th TAG2  year. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 after i am seen by a doctor, how long does it take until they can recommend me for this medicine QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there is no official waiting period under current florida law, however, all persons approved for medical marijuana must receive their card from the state to be able to take medical marijuana for their condition. the department of health card division has created some delays up to 30 days. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long does it take to get my medical marijuana prescription once i have received my recommendation QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 once our physician enters the prescription recommendation into the registry, you may go pick up your prescription^ at the dispensary immediately. note that there has been a delay at the state level for patients receiving their medical marijuana card, and this is needed to receive a recommendation and pick up medicine. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i live out of state but vacation in florida or have a residence in florida and live there part-time, can i qualify QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 yes, a “seasonal resident” can qualify, under specific rules of the law: TAG2  “seasonal resident” TAG2  means any person who temporarily resides in this state for a period of 31 consecutive days in each calendar year, maintains a temporary residence in this state, returns to the state of jurisdiction of his or her residence at least one time during each calendar year, and is registered to vote or pays income tax in another state or jurisdiction. to read the entire rules for what qualifications are necessary for a “seasonal resident”,  TAG2 click here TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i live in georgia. can i get a prescription^ for medical marijuana in florida QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 maybe. current florida law makes allowances for a “seasonal resident” from georgia (or any other state outside of florida) to qualify. there are very specific rules which qualify someone as a “seasonal resident” and medcan doctor’s office requires these rules to be met before anyone is placed into the registry to receive a recommendation. see our information sheet on “ TAG2 seasonal resident requirements TAG2 “. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 why are fees not discounted or insurance accepted QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 our fee is modest in consideration of the work involved to prequalify patients ahead of time, schedule their appointments, check them in, obtain their medical records and complete the paperwork to be seen by a doctor. then, every patient has to be seen in the office in person by a physician, a history obtained, and the patient examined. eforce registry is accessed and reviewed. the patient informed consent form is seven pages long, the patient certification checklist has 14 items to complete, we are required to send patient information to the department of health for every patient followup visit, there is a ‘smokeables letter’ we must send for patients using smokeables, we have to place all recommendations into a computer registry, and there is literally masses of state-required paperwork. for every 8 hour day the doctor sees patients in the medcan office, it takes 45 hours of our support staff for patient care and to properly complete everything required by the state of florida statute. certainly, in light of the workload required, our fees are reasonable. TAG1  TAG1 ^note: a medical marijuana prescription, is not an actual prescription by definition due to the fact it is a control 1 substance, and as such, cannot be medically ‘prescribed’. the term for an order for medical marijuana is called a “recommendation”.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how are cbd and thc different QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) and cannabidiol (cbd) are the two most prevalent chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant.  although they are both cannabinoids, they produce different effects.  the biggest of these differences is that thc is psychoactive, whereas cbd is considered non-intoxicating. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how do i know how much cannabis to take QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 since every individual is different, and there are also multiple factors to take into account, there is currently no standard dose of cannabis. we all react differently to substances. therefore, if you are not an avid user of cannabis, your tolerance will be low and the effects will be stronger.it is important to “start low and go slow” when finding the sweet spot that achieves your desired outcome(s). TAG1  TAG1 experts suggest starting with the minimum effective dose (med) and slowly increasing as tolerance builds.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how do you use a product sublingually QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 some cannabis products can be taken sublingually, which means placed under the tongue.  common products taken sublingually are tinctures, sprays, dissolvable strips, and lozenges.  these products can be placed within the mouth, specifically under the tongue, because thereare a large number of blood vessels there which absorb cannabinoids.  this delivery method offers rapid and effective absorption. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how harmful is smoking on my lungs QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 historically speaking smoking cannabis is the most common delivery method and something that many associate with  cannabis use. smoking cannabis is often considered a controversial delivery method because it contains chemicals and carcinogens that are potentially harmful toyour lungs. some research has found that cannabis smokers do not appear to have an increased incidence of lung cancer. a lack of increased risk, however, does not mean no risk. TAG1  TAG1 chronic cannabis smokers can develop bronchitis. users should be aware of the risks involved with smoking and should use this method in moderation. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how can cannabis flower have such a wide variety of scents QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the aroma of cannabis flower can be attributed to its unique terpene (terpenoid) profile.  terpenes are essential oils that occur naturally in plants, trees and flowers.  throughout the growth cycle, terpenes act as a defense mechanism that deter and/or attract certain insects and animals.  once the cannabis flower is dried, cured or chemically altered, these terpenes become denatured by oxidation and are then called terpenoids. these terpenoids give off specific aromas and some cannabis strains have even become known for their unique smells. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 is cannabis addictive QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 you’ll likely hear loads of differing viewpoints on whether cannabis addiction is real or not. one thing is typically agreed upon, however, and that is — if dependency occurs, it is an addiction in psychological terms rather than in the physical sense. in comparison to pharmaceuticals (manyof which carry a high risk for addiction), cannabis has a significantly lower potential for adverse side effects, withdrawal and/or dependency. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how long does cannabis stay in my system QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the length of time varies depending on how often you use cannabis.  thc is stored in the body’s fat cells and it also accumulates in the body over time.  there are different ways to test for thc and some tests can locate its presence longer than others.  thc appears to stay in saliva the shortest amount of time, followed by urine and then hair. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what are the potential adverse effects of cannabis QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 it should first be said that using cannabis responsibly and in small doses can help users avoid feeling any negative effects.  cannabis has yet to cause even one death; however, consuming too much can lead to some uncomfortable side effects.  some of these are very mild, like dry mouth and increased appetite.  other users have reported feeling dizzy or disoriented.cannabis overdose can cause users to experience feelings of anxiety and slight paranoia. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is aged flower QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cannabis changes over time when it has been exposed to oxygen, heat or uv light.  these changes alter the chemical compounds in cannabis (cannabinoids and terpenes) and the effects the user may experience.  this is why proper storage of your cannabis is important.  aged thc, for instance, converts into the cannabinoid cbn.  cbn offers an array of benefits, the most pronounced of which is its sedative effect which makes it helpful in treating insomnia. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is heated flower QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the chemical compounds within cannabis are altered depending on which stage they are in.  cannabis flower that undergoes exposure to heat  (decarboxylation) or time (has been dried and cured) has undergone a chemical change, which in turn alters its chemical makeup.  heat and time convert thca and cbda to thc and cbd, respectively. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is raw flower QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the chemical compounds within cannabis are altered depending on which stage they are in.  cannabis that has been freshly-harvested, and is uncured (not dried) is flower in it’s “raw” stage.  raw flower is cannabis in its acid form and is comprised of different chemical compounds.  for example, raw cannabis contains the cannabinoid thca (among others), but when its stage is altered by undergoing heat or time (becoming dried), the cannabinoid thca is then converted to its psychoactive neutral form, called thc. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 there are a few things you can do if you find yourself experiencing any discomfort: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 keep calm — breathe and remember the effects will pass. TAG2  TAG2 take pure cbd to reduce feelings of anxiety and paranoia. TAG2  TAG2 drink plenty of water. lemon water has been said to help. TAG2  TAG2 sleep it off — time is the best remedy. TAG2  TAG2 chewing on black peppercorns is a popular, quick fix. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why are there so many kinds of concentrates/extracts QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as cannabis products continue to advance and mature, new forms of concentrates and extracts become popular.  this is a direct result of the many and varied extraction processes for the cannabis plant.  many consumers enjoy the therapeutic benefits associated with these products because of their potent amount of cannabinoids, and now there are plenty of options when it comes to concentrates/extracts and their consumption methods. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is the entourage effect QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 terpenes and cannabinoids work together to achieve a wide range of health benefits.  this synergistic interaction is often referred to as the entourage effect, which magnifies the benefits of the individual components of the plant.  in short, the impact of the entire plant is greater than the sum of its parts.  for example, since terpenes and cbd are able to counteract the psychoactive effects of thc, it is thought that the use of the whole plant can amplify the medicinal benefits of cannabis while simultaneously mitigating anxiety induced by high levels of thc. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is the endocannabinoid system (ecs) QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 interestingly, the studying of the cannabis plant is what led to the discovery of the human endocannabinoid system, which is responsible for establishing and maintaining our health and affects almost every system in our bodies, this is why cannabis can treat an array of symptoms.  the ecs helps regulate the central nervous system, the brain, the intestinal tract, the immune system and the peripheral nervous system.  this is why it affects things like sleep, appetite, mood, memory, temperature regulation, reproduction, motor control, pain, and pleasure.  endocannabinoids and their receptors are found throughout our bodies, but no matter where they are, they have the same driving force: homeostasis (aka keeping us in balance).  the cannabinoids found in cannabis assist in correcting deficiencies and restoring balance to ourbodies (and minds). TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how can i use cannabis without feeling high QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 surprisingly, there are currently many options for those who would like to benefit from the healing properties of cannabis yet aren’t comfortable with too much psychoactivity.  a great place to start would be cbd-rich products since cbd is non-intoxicating but offers plenty of medical benefits.  you can begin by exploring high cbd to thc ratio products, like an 18:1 cbd:thc tincture, for example.  eventually, once tolerance is built, higher thc ratios could be less likely to produce  sychoactive effects while still benefiting from thc’s healing properties. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what are my options for consuming cannabis QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 there are more consumption methods than ever these days.  some may be considered healthier than others (i.e. vaping over smoking flower), but there truly is no “best” or “one size fits all” method.  what way you prefer will be based on evaluating convenience, strength, healthfulness, onset and duration.  since there is such a wide range of options, you can explore each and pick a favorite or two, or tailor your consumption method based on the situation.  also, there are plenty of ways to be discreet about your cannabis use, if need be! TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why is cannabis lab-tested QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 labs test cannabis for two main reasons: to make sure the products are safe for consumption and to let consumers know about the potency of the products they’re using.  the test results ensure that there are no pesticides or other chemicals present as well as accurately gauging the chemical composition of cannabinoids and terpenes.  interestingly, since cannabis is influenced by many environmental factors, two strains with the same name that weren’t grown under the same conditions can have different levels of each compound. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what are cannabis strains QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cannabis strains, also called chemovars are different variations of genetic profiles.  they often have creative names, like “durban poison” or “pineapple express”, and have their own cannabinoid and terpene profiles that cause certain effects.  currently, many have lumped strains into three categories – like “indica” (restful), “sativa” (alert), or “hybrid” (balanced).  this is a very general concept since the best way to anticipate how you’ll feel is by knowing what that strain is composed of.  thc and cbd potency is a good place to start! TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the truth is that every individual has unique body systems that cannabis can affect slightly differently.  although there are general common effects that you can expect, there are additional variables to consider that can affect your experience.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 cannabis composition: what cannabinoids and terpenes are present, and in what levels. TAG2  TAG2 delivery method:  how cannabis is consumed can change the onset and duration times.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 as a veteran, is there a different process for applying for my medical marijuana card QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 yes. veterans receiving health care at a u.s. department of veterans affarirs (va) facility, do not need to provide a physician written certification, but must instead provide medical records from the va facility from the last 12 months. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 use va form 10-5345 to request these medical records. if you have received medical care for your debilitating medical condition for more than 5 years at a va facility, you must mark “other” on va form 10-5345 under “information requested” then write that you are requesting information about the treatment of your qualified coniditon for the most recent 12-month period. under “purposes or need for which the information to be used by individual to whom information is to be released” write “personal medical purposes.” under “name and address of organization, individual or title of individual to whome information is to be released” write your address. the records will be sent to you.

TAG1  TAG1 is it legal to drive while using medical cannabis QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 driving impaired, no matter the substance, is illegal. the same laws that apply to driving under the influence of alcohol, also apply to driving under the influence of cannabis. with some medications, it is difficult to determine if someone is under the influence at the time of a urine or blood test, because the substance can be detected long after the effects have worn off. this is the case with cannabis, because its metabolites linger in the body for an extended period of time. because of this, someone could fail a blood or urine test, even though they are not under the influence at the time. state sen. tick segerblom, nevada’s leading medical cannabiws advocate who sponsored the 2013 legislation that established the dispensary system, proposes a better alternative would be to issue duis based on a subjective test using an officer’s observations instead of blood and urine tests.

TAG1  TAG1 if you’re flying to another state,  TAG2 check for their laws, TAG2  including reciprocity with state medical marijuana laws. in no case is medical marijuana or marijuana legal to transport out of state. TAG1  TAG1 non-citizens should beware about carrying medical marijuana through us airports. although tsa and local police have generally been tolerant of medical marijuana in airline baggage in legal states like ca, this may not be the case when dealing with non-citizens. TAG1  TAG1 if you are not a u.s. citizen, think about whether you should carry your medical cannabis recommendation with you. reports are that ice is asking if people have their cards and/or use medical marijuana, and using that as grounds for deportation on grounds that they are in violation of the federal controlled substances act. this means permanent residents, visa holders, and those who are not naturalized nor are a natural born citizen. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 19. i am traveling to another state. can i use my california medical marijuana card or recommendation there QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2 arizona TAG2  and  TAG2 montana TAG2  have reciprocity in their medical marijuana laws.  TAG2 maine TAG2  allows out-of-state patients to exercise their rights for 30 days.  TAG2 rhode island TAG2  respects out-of-state recommendations for any “debilitating medical condition.”  TAG2 michigan TAG2  accepts medical cards from states that also have reciprocity (california’s doesn’t). vermont allows recommendations from neighboring states for vermont residents only. TAG1  TAG1 the oregon law does not include a reciprocity provision. however, the oregon court of appeals has ruled (and the oregon medical marijuana program has confirmed) that patients from out of state are permitted to register with the oregon medical marijuana program to obtain a registry identification card, the same as an oregon resident, which will protect them from arrest or prosecution while in oregon. these out of state patients are required to obtain a recommendation for the medical use of marijuana from an oregon licensed physician.  TAG2 state v. berringer, TAG2  229 p3d 615 (2010).

TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 20. can i use marijuana on federal land in california QUESTION  TAG2 no. marijuana users and medical cannabis patients are not protected while on federal park land or forest land in california. cal norml has received reports of campers and those driving through federal land who are searched, charged with  TAG2 federal possession statutes, TAG2  and had their cannabis confiscated. a california medical recommendation is not a defense in federal court to these charges.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 22. is hashish covered under the medical marijuana laws QUESTION  TAG2 qualified patients can use and make hashish legally under state law. see TAG2  attorney general’s ruling TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 in december 2014,  TAG2 a california appeals court ruled TAG2  that concentrated cannabis qualifies as medical marijuana under the compassionate use act. this doesn’t really mark a change in policy; but since some courts and das have been reluctant to respect the ag’s opinion, it’s good to have an appellate court rule this way. TAG1  TAG1 however, the  TAG2 bergen decision (2008) TAG2  determined that using butane to make hash oil is not covered by the medical use statutes. california health and safety code section 11379.6(a) makes it unlawful to engage in the chemical extraction of a substance as part of the process of manufacturing a controlled substance. the charge carries a prison sentence of 3-7 years and a fine of up to $50,000. several fires have been reported due to bho extraction. it is unsafe, and illegal. butane hash-making equipment and chemicals seem to be a red flag for authorities when it comes to child endangerment charges and possible removal of children from the home. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 23. can i use medical marijuana while on probation or parole QUESTION  TAG2 yes, unless the judge specifies that you cannot under the terms of your probation, which you may appeal. you can request that the judge affirm your use of medical marijuana or modify the terms of your probation to allow medical marijuana use. see section 11362.795 of  TAG2 sb420 TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 people v. tilehkooh TAG2  TAG2  established that it is state, not federal law that governs this question. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 24. can i grow or use marijuana with children in the house QUESTION  TAG2 there is nothing in state law against this. however it’s advised to keep your medical marijuana away from children. make sure that you don’t leave edibles around where kids can get them, and keep gardens away from where they play. butane hash-making equipment and chemicals seem to be a red flag for authorities when it comes to children. TAG1  TAG1 in rare cases child protective services has become involved, mostly in cases with large plant numbers, evidence of sales, neglect, or messy divorce proceedings. in such cases, cps tends not to be understanding about medical marijuana and can always allege child endangerment. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 prop. 64 TAG2 , which passed in november 2016, states that cps cannot use a parent’s status as a medical marijuana patient as the sole reason to interfere with parental rights.  TAG2 h&amp;sc 11362.84 TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 also see:  TAG2 family law and cannabis alliance TAG2  and  TAG2 parents, kids and cannabis: best practices TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 25. can i own or buy a gun if i use marijuana QUESTION  TAG2 the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms sent  TAG2 letters to gun dealers TAG2  in 2011 warning them they could not sell to known marijuana users. when buying a gun,  TAG2 question 11e on the atf form TAG2  asks, “are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana QUESTION ” TAG1  TAG1 answering yes makes you ineligible to purchase; falsely answering no is in principle punishable as perjury. this should not affect current gun owners. TAG1  TAG1 on august 31, 2016  TAG2 a three-judge panel of the 9th circuit court of appeals rejected a challenge to this policy TAG2  from a medical marijuana patient in  TAG2  TAG2 wilson v. lynch. TAG2  TAG2  the opinion states: “wilson could have amassed legal firearms before acquiring a registry card, and [federal statutes] and the open letter would not impede her right to keep her firearms or to use them to protect herself and her home. in addition, wilson could acquire firearms and exercise her right to self-defense at any time by surrendering her registry card, thereby demonstrating to a firearms dealer that there is no reasonable cause to believe she is an unlawful drug user.” TAG1  TAG1 although california law does not prohibit marijuana users from having guns, using a gun in connection with an offense such as cultivation or possession with sale can result in additional criminal charges. users are advised to keep their guns in a location that is separate from their marijuana. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 26. can i lose my housing if i use or grow marijuana QUESTION  TAG2 the us dept of housing and urban development has stated that  TAG2 local housing authorities can determine their own policies regarding medical marijuana use in hud housing. TAG2  we suggest  TAG2 contacting a local norml attorney TAG2  about your housing rights. TAG1  TAG1 landlords may make conditions on tenancy that exclude medical marijuana cultivation or use. oftentimes, they need to be educated about the law; you can show them  TAG2 our patient’s rights to medical marijuana TAG2  pamphlet and explain that you are legal under state law.  TAG2 vaporizing TAG2  or using edibles can be a solution to issues of smells that annoy neighbors.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 start with a low dose and increase it slowly over a period of 1 to 2 weeks or longer. once you begin feeling the beneficial effects, stay at that dose for a while and see how you do. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what will my dose of medical marijuana be QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 pills, oil, tincture, liquid, vaping, and whole flower for vaping are currently approved. topical lotions and creams are available.  edibles and whole flower for smoking are not approved by the state. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 what forms of medical marijuana will be available QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 there are advantages and disadvantages to each form. the main difference is ease of use and how fast the medicine starts to work. generally using a vape pen produces the quickest delivery of medicine into your bloodstream. the next fastest method is a sublingual spray of tincture or liquid. the slowest would be taking a pill. as a general rule, the faster the medicine is absorbed, the shorter the duration of effects.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 will my health insurance pay for visits or for the (mmj) QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the short answer is “no.” even if you are taking a form of medical  marijuana that does not impair your driving, if you are pulled over by  the police and undergo drug testing you will quite likely test positive and be subject to legal penalties. avoid medical cannabis use that puts you or others at risk, such as using it while driving, at work, or in public places. remember, you can still be arrested for cannabis use and penalties can be stiff. as with any other medication, such as opiates and benzodiazepines, it remains illegal to drive while “under the influence.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 is it legal to drive while taking medical marijuana TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 mmj is about as addictive as caffeine. interestingly, the withdrawal symptoms are about the same as well: some patients experience mild to moderate headaches, some feel mild to moderate irritability or  restlessness. for most, these symptoms fade quickly over about a week to 10 days. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 is medical marijuana (mmj) addictive QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 many patients with chronic pain have become dependent on daily opioid  therapy for their pain. once started on mmj many patients are able to  cut back on their routine opioid use. we urge caution when reducing or stopping chronic opioid therapy. here are a few of our suggestions: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 do not stop opioids suddenly. it is better to taper off of opioids  in order to avoid withdrawal. many mmj patients begin to cut back on  their opioid use within the first 2 weeks of starting on mmj treatment. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 never cut sustained release opioid medications, such as oxycontin  and ms contin, in half. cutting these and similar medications causes a  sudden release of all of the opiate in a short time instead of over a  longer period as they were designed to do and could be fatal. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 however, plain percocet and vicodin may be cut in half to facilitate tapering your dose. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 we recommend you inform your prescribing physician of your intention  to reduce your dose. they should be happy to help guide you through the  process. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 interestingly, mmj treats most of opiate withdrawal symptoms such as  nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, diarrhea, muscle spasm, anxiety,  agitation, insomnia, runny nose and sweating. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 finally, most patients are able to reduce their opiate dose by 50 to 80% and up to 40% of patients can wean themselves off of opiates completely!

TAG1  TAG1 in rare cases, child protective services has become involved, mostly in cases with large plant numbers, evidence of sales, neglect, or messy divorce proceedings. in such cases, cps tends not to be understanding about medical marijuana and can always allege child endangerment. TAG1  TAG1 q. can i own or buy a gun with a medical marijuana card QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 a: the federal bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms sent letters to gun dealers in 2011 warning them they could not sell to known medical marijuana users. when buying a gun, you may be asked whether you are a user of illegal drugs and/or medical marijuana. TAG1  TAG1 answering yes makes you ineligible to purchase; falsely answering no is in principle punishable as perjury. this should not affect current gun owners. although california law does not prohibit medical marijuana users from having guns, using a gun in connection with an offense such as cultivation or possession with sale can result in additional criminal charges. users are advised to keep their guns in a location that is separate from their marijuana.

TAG2  TAG2 [35] TAG2  TAG2  typically, adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious; TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  they include tiredness, dizziness, increased appetite, and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects. other effects can include impaired short-term memory; impaired motor coordination; altered judgment; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses. TAG2  TAG2 [36] TAG2  TAG2  tolerance to these effects develops over a period of days or weeks. the amount of cannabis normally used for medicinal purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults, though long-term treatment in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments. withdrawal symptoms are rarely a problem with controlled medical administration of cannabinoids. the ability to drive vehicles or to operate machinery may be impaired until a tolerance is developed. TAG2  TAG2 [22] TAG2  TAG2   although supporters of medical cannabis say that it is safe, TAG2  TAG2 [35] TAG2  TAG2  further research is required to assess the long-term safety of its use.

TAG2  TAG2 [38] TAG2  TAG2  psychotic episodes are well-documented and typically resolve within minutes or hours. there have been few reports of symptoms lasting longer. TAG2  TAG2 [39] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [40] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 according to the  TAG2 united states department of health and human services TAG2 , there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with cannabis use in 2011. these statistics include visits in which the patient was treated for a condition induced by or related to recent cannabis use. the drug use must be &quot;implicated&quot; in the emergency department visit, but does not need to be the direct cause of the visit. most of the illicit drug emergency room visits involved multiple drugs. TAG2  TAG2 [41] TAG2  TAG2  in 129,000 cases, cannabis was the only implicated drug. TAG2  TAG2 [42] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [43] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 effects of chronic use may include  TAG2 bronchitis TAG2 , a  TAG2 cannabis dependence TAG2  syndrome, and subtle impairments of attention and memory. these deficits persist while chronically intoxicated. TAG2  TAG2 [38] TAG2  TAG2  compared to non-smokers, people who smoked cannabis regularly in adolescence exhibit reduced connectivity in specific brain regions associated with memory, learning, alertness, and executive function. TAG2  TAG2 [43] TAG2  TAG2  one study suggested that sustained heavy, daily, adolescent onset cannabis use over decades is associated with a decline in iq by age 38, with no effects found in those who initiated cannabis use later, or in those who ceased use earlier in adulthood. TAG2  TAG2 [44] TAG2  TAG2  a follow-up review found that iq deficit may be a precursor, rather than result, of cannabis use, and that social and environmental factors are a likely influence. TAG2  TAG2 [45] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there has been a  limited amount of studies that have looked at the  TAG2 effects of smoking cannabis TAG2  on the respiratory system. TAG2  TAG2 [46] TAG2  TAG2   chronic heavy marijuana smoking is associated with coughing, production of sputum, wheezing, coughing, and other symptoms of chronic bronchitis. TAG2  TAG2 [38] TAG2  TAG2  regular cannabis use has not been shown to cause significant abnormalities in lung function. TAG2  TAG2 [47] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cannabis smoke contains thousands of organic and inorganic chemical compounds. this  TAG2 tar TAG2  is chemically similar to that found in tobacco smoke, TAG2  TAG2 [48] TAG2  TAG2  and over fifty known  TAG2 carcinogens TAG2  have been identified in cannabis smoke, TAG2  TAG2 [49] TAG2  TAG2  including nitrosamines, reactive aldehydes, and polycyclic hydrocarbons, including benz[a]pyrene. TAG2  TAG2 [50] TAG2  TAG2  light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer. evidence for causing these cancers is mixed concerning heavy, long-term use. in general there are far lower risks of pulmonary complications for regular cannabis smokers when compared with those of tobacco. TAG2  TAG2 [47] TAG2  TAG2  combustion products are not present when using a  TAG2 vaporizer TAG2 , consuming thc in pill form, or consuming  TAG2 cannabis edibles TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 there is serious suspicion among cardiologists, spurring research but falling short of definitive proof, that cannabis use has the potential to contribute to cardiovascular disease. TAG2  TAG2 [51] TAG2  TAG2   cannabis is believed to be an aggravating factor in rare cases of  TAG2 arteritis TAG2 , a serious condition that in some cases leads to amputation. because 97% of case-reports also smoked tobacco, a formal association with cannabis could not be made. if cannabis arteritis turns out to be a distinct clinical entity, it might be the consequence of  TAG2 vasoconstrictor TAG2  activity observed from  TAG2 delta-8-thc TAG2  and  TAG2 delta-9-thc TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [52] TAG2  TAG2   other serious cardiovascular events including  TAG2 myocardial infarction TAG2 , stroke,  TAG2 sudden cardiac death TAG2 , and  TAG2 cardiomyopathy TAG2  have been reported to be temporally associated with cannabis use. research in these events is complicated because cannabis is often used in conjunction with tobacco, and drugs such as alcohol and cocaine. TAG2  TAG2 [53] TAG2  TAG2  these putative effects can be taken in context of a wide range of cardiovascular phenomena regulated by the  TAG2 endocannabinoid TAG2  system and an overall role of cannabis in causing decreased peripheral resistance and increased  TAG2 cardiac output TAG2 , which potentially could pose a threat to those with cardiovascular disease. TAG2  TAG2 [54] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cannabis usually causes no tolerance or withdrawal symptoms except in heavy users. in a survey of heavy users 42.4% experienced withdrawal symptoms when they tried to quit marijuana such as craving, irritability, boredom, anxiety and sleep disturbances. TAG2  TAG2 [55] TAG2  TAG2  about 9% of those who experiment with marijuana eventually become dependent. the rate goes up to one in six among those who begin use as adolescents, and one-quarter to one-half of those who use it daily according to a  TAG2 nida TAG2  review. TAG2  TAG2 [43] TAG2  TAG2  a 2013 review estimates daily use is associated with a 10-20% rate of dependence. TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  the highest risk of cannabis dependence is found in those with a history of poor academic achievement, deviant behavior in childhood and adolescence, rebelliousness, poor parental relationships, or a parental history of drug and alcohol problems. TAG2  TAG2 [56] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a 2013 literature review found that exposure to marijuana had biologically-based physical, mental, behavioral and social health consequences and was &quot;associated with diseases of the liver (particularly with co-existing hepatitis c), lungs, heart, and vasculature&quot;. TAG2  TAG2 [57] TAG2  TAG2  there are numerous other reasons why people look for medical cannabis and to make people aware of whether they are eligible to accept medical cannabis as a dose, there are numerous websites that are currently providing online consultations through video calling. people are provided licenses with the help of which, they can either grow medical cannabis, or purchase it legally throughout the state. this is done only after precisely reviewing the applications of patients. TAG2  TAG2 [58] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cognitive effects TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a 2011 systematic review evaluated published studies of the acute and long-term cognitive effects of cannabis.  thc intoxication is well established to impair cognitive functioning on an acute basis, including effects on the ability to plan, organize, solve problems, make decisions, and control impulses. the extent of this impact may be greater in novice users, and paradoxically, those habituated to high-level ingestion may have reduced cognition during withdrawal.  studies of long-term effects on cognition have provided conflicting results, with some studies finding no difference between long-term abstainers and never-users and others finding long-term deficits.  the discrepancies between studies may reflect greater long-term effects among heavier users relative to occasional users, and greater duration of effect among those with heavy use as adolescents compared to later in life. TAG2  TAG2 [59] TAG2  TAG2   a second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function. TAG2  TAG2 [60] TAG2  TAG2  a 2003 meta-analysis concluded that any long-term cognitive effects were relatively modest in magnitude and limited to certain aspects of learning and memory. TAG2  TAG2 [61] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 impact on psychosis TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 exposure to thc can cause acute transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and people with schizophrenia. TAG2  TAG2 [15] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a 2007 meta analysis concluded that cannabis use reduced the average age of onset of psychosis by 2.7 years relative to non-cannabis use. TAG2  TAG2 [62] TAG2  TAG2   a 2005 meta analysis concluded that adolescent use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis, and that the risk is dose-related. TAG2  TAG2 [63] TAG2  TAG2  a 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis, but that cannabis use is &quot;neither necessary nor sufficient&quot; to cause psychosis. TAG2  TAG2 [64] TAG2  TAG2  a french review from 2009 came to a conclusion that cannabis use, particularly that before age 15, was a factor in the development of schizophrenic disorders. TAG2  TAG2 [65] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 other potential long-term effects TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a 2008  TAG2 national institutes of health TAG2  study of 19 chronic heavy marijuana users with cardiac and cerebral abnormalities (averaging 28 g to 272 g (1 to 9+ oz) weekly) and 24 controls found elevated levels of  TAG2 apolipoprotein c-iii TAG2  (apoc-iii) in the chronic smokers. TAG2  TAG2 [66] TAG2  TAG2  an increase in apoc-iii levels induces the development of  TAG2 hypertriglyceridemia TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 pharmacology TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2 genus TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 cannabis TAG2  TAG2  contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids:  TAG2  TAG2 cannabis indica TAG2  TAG2  and  TAG2  TAG2 cannabis sativa TAG2  TAG2 , which are listed as schedule i medicinal plants in the us; TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  a third species,  TAG2  TAG2 cannabis ruderalis TAG2  TAG2 , has few psychogenic properties. TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  cannabis contains more than 460 compounds; TAG2  TAG2 [8] TAG2  TAG2  at least 80 of these are  TAG2 cannabinoids TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [67] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [68] TAG2  TAG2  –  TAG2 chemical compounds TAG2  that interact with  TAG2 cannabinoid receptors TAG2  in the brain. TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  as of 2012, more than 20 cannabinoids were being studied by the u.s. fda. TAG2  TAG2 [69] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is  TAG2 tetrahydrocannabinol TAG2  (or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as thc). TAG2  TAG2 [8] TAG2  TAG2  other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol,  TAG2 cannabidiol TAG2  (cbd),  TAG2 cannabinol TAG2  (cbn),  TAG2 cannabicyclol TAG2  (cbl),  TAG2 cannabichromene TAG2  (cbc) and  TAG2 cannabigerol TAG2  (cbg); they have less psychotropic effects than thc, but may play a role in the overall effect of cannabis. TAG2  TAG2 [8] TAG2  TAG2  the most studied are thc, cbd and cbn. TAG2  TAG2 [57] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cb1 and cb2 are the primary cannabinoid receptors responsible for several of the effects of cannabinoids, although other receptors may play a role as well. both belong to a group of receptors called g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs). cb1 receptors are found in very high levels in the brain and are thought to be responsible for psychoactive effects. TAG2  TAG2 [70] TAG2  TAG2  cb2 receptors are found peripherally throughout the body and are thought to modulate pain and inflammation. TAG2  TAG2 [71] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 absorption TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cannabinoid absorption is dependent on its route of administration. TAG1  TAG1 inhaled and vaporized thc have similar absorption profiles to smoked thc, with a bioavailability ranging from 10 to 35%. oral administration has the lowest bioavailability of approximately 6%, variable absorption depending on the vehicle used, and the longest time to peak plasma levels  (2 to 6 hours) compared to smoked or vaporized thc. TAG2  TAG2 [72] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 similar to thc, cbd has poor oral bioavailability, approximately 6%. the low bioavailability is largely attributed to significant first-pass metabolism in the liver and erratic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. however, oral administration of cbd has a faster time to peak concentrations (2 hours) than thc. TAG2  TAG2 [72] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 due to the poor bioavailability of oral preparations, alternative routes of administration have been studied, including sublingual and rectal. these alternative formulations maximize bioavailability and reduce first-pass metabolism. sublingual administration in rabbits yielded bioavailability of 16% and time to peak concentration of 4 hours. TAG2  TAG2 [73] TAG2  TAG2  rectal administration in monkeys doubled bioavailability to 13.5% and achieved peak blood concentrations within 1 to 8 hours after administration. TAG2  TAG2 [74] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 distribution TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 like cannabinoid absorption, distribution is also dependent on route of administration. smoking and inhalation of vaporized cannabis have better absorption than do other routes of administration, and therefore also have more predictable distribution. TAG2  TAG2 [74] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [75] TAG2  TAG2  thc is highly protein bound once absorbed, with only 3% found unbound in the plasma. it distributes rapidly to highly vascularized organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, as well as to various glands. low levels can be detected in the brain, testes, and unborn fetuses, all of which are protected from systemic circulation via barriers. TAG2  TAG2 [76] TAG2  TAG2  thc further distributes into fatty tissues a few days after administration due to its high lipophilicity, and is found deposited in the spleen and fat after redistribution. TAG2  TAG2 [75] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [77] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [78] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 metabolism TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 delta-9-thc is the primary molecule responsible for the effects of cannabis. delta-9-thc is metabolized in the liver and turns into 11-oh-thc. TAG2  TAG2 [79] TAG2  TAG2  11-oh-thc is the first metabolic product in this pathway. both delta-9-thc and 11-oh-thc are psychoactive. the metabolism of thc into 11-oh-thc plays a part in the heightened psychoactive effects of edible cannabis. TAG2  TAG2 [80] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 next, 11-oh-thc is metabolized in the liver into 11-cooh-thc, which is the second metabolic product of thc. TAG2  TAG2 [81] TAG2  TAG2  11-cooh-thc is not psychoactive. TAG2  TAG2 [79] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 ingestion of edible cannabis products lead to a slower onset of effect than the inhalation of it because the thc travels to the liver first through the blood before it travels to the rest of the body. inhaled cannabis can result in thc going directly to the brain, where it then travels from the brain back to the liver in recirculation for metabolism. TAG2  TAG2 [79] TAG2  TAG2  eventually, both routes of metabolism result in the metabolism of psychoactive thc to inactive 11-cooh-thc. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 excretion TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 due to substantial metabolism of thc and cbd, their metabolites are excreted mostly via  TAG2 feces TAG2 , rather than by urine. TAG2  TAG2 [72] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [82] TAG2  TAG2  after delta-9-thc is hydroxylated into 11-oh-thc via cyp2c9, cyp2c19, and cyp3a4, it undergoes phase ii metabolism into more than 30 metabolites, a majority of which are products of  TAG2 glucuronidation TAG2 . approximately 65% of thc is excreted in feces and 25% in the urine, while the remaining 10% is excreted by other means. TAG2  TAG2 [72] TAG2  TAG2  the terminal half-life of thc is 25 to 36 hours, TAG2  TAG2 [83] TAG2  TAG2  whereas for cbd it is 18 to 32 hours. TAG2  TAG2 [82] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cbd is hydroxylated by p450 liver enzymes into 7-oh-cbd. its metabolites are products of primarily cyp2c19 and cyp3a4 activity, with potential activity of cyp1a1, cyp1a2, cyp2c9, and cyp2d6. TAG2  TAG2 [84] TAG2  TAG2  similar to delta-9-thc, a majority of cbd is excreted in feces and some in the urine. TAG2  TAG2 [72] TAG2  TAG2  the terminal half-life is approximately 18–32 hours. TAG2  TAG2 [85] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 administration TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 illustrating various forms of medicinal cannabis TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 smoking TAG2  has been the means of administration of cannabis for many users, but it is not suitable for the use of cannabis as a medicine. TAG2  TAG2 [86] TAG2  TAG2  it was the most common method of medical cannabis consumption in the us as of 2013 TAG2  TAG2 [update] TAG2  TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  it is difficult to predict the pharmacological response to cannabis because concentration of cannabinoids varies widely, as there are different ways of preparing it for consumption (smoked, applied as oils, eaten, infused into other foods,  or drunk) and a lack of production controls. TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  the potential for adverse effects from smoke inhalation makes smoking a less viable option than oral preparations. TAG2  TAG2 [86] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 cannabis vaporizers TAG2  have gained popularity because of a perception among users that fewer harmful chemicals are ingested when components are inhaled via aerosol rather than smoke. TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  cannabinoid medicines are available in pill form ( TAG2 dronabinol TAG2  and  TAG2 nabilone TAG2 ) and liquid extracts formulated into an oromucosal spray ( TAG2 nabiximols TAG2 ). TAG2  TAG2 [4] TAG2  TAG2  oral preparations are &quot;problematic due to the uptake of cannabinoids into fatty tissue, from which they are released slowly, and the significant first-pass liver metabolism, which breaks down δ9thc and contributes further to the variability of plasma concentrations&quot;. TAG2  TAG2 [86] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the us food and drug administration (fda) has not approved smoked cannabis for any condition or disease, as it deems that evidence is lacking concerning safety and efficacy. TAG2  TAG2 [87] TAG2  TAG2  the fda issued a 2006 advisory against  TAG2 smoked TAG2  medical cannabis stating: &quot;marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.&quot; TAG2  TAG2 [87] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 history TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 history of medical cannabis TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 ancient TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cannabis, called  TAG2 má TAG2  TAG2 麻 TAG2  (meaning &quot;hemp; cannabis; numbness&quot;) or  TAG2 dàmá TAG2  TAG2 大麻 TAG2  (with &quot;big; great&quot;) in chinese, was used in  TAG2 taiwan TAG2  for fiber starting about 10,000 years ago. TAG2  TAG2 [88] TAG2  TAG2  the botanist  TAG2 hui-lin li TAG2  wrote that in china, &quot;the use of cannabis in medicine was probably a very early development. since ancient humans used hemp seed as food, it was quite natural for them to also discover the medicinal properties of the plant.&quot; TAG2  TAG2 [89] TAG2  TAG2  emperor  TAG2 shen-nung TAG2 , who was also a pharmacologist, wrote a book on treatment methods in 2737 bce that included the medical benefits of cannabis. he recommended the substance for many ailments, including constipation, gout, rheumatism, and absent-mindedness. TAG2  TAG2 [90] TAG2  TAG2  cannabis is one of the  TAG2 50 &quot;fundamental&quot; herbs TAG2  in  TAG2 traditional chinese medicine TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [91] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2 ebers papyrus TAG2  (c. 1550 bce) from  TAG2 ancient egypt TAG2  describes medical cannabis. TAG2  TAG2 [92] TAG2  TAG2  the ancient egyptians used hemp (cannabis) in  TAG2 suppositories TAG2  for relieving the pain of  TAG2 hemorrhoids TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [93] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 surviving texts from  TAG2 ancient india TAG2  confirm that cannabis' psychoactive properties were recognized, and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments, including insomnia, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, and pain, including during childbirth. TAG2  TAG2 [94] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2 ancient greeks TAG2  used cannabis to dress wounds and sores on their horses, TAG2  TAG2 [95] TAG2  TAG2  and in humans, dried leaves of cannabis were used to treat nose bleeds, and cannabis seeds were used to expel tapeworms. TAG2  TAG2 [95] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in the  TAG2 medieval islamic world TAG2 ,  TAG2 arabic physicians TAG2  made use of the  TAG2 diuretic TAG2 ,  TAG2 antiemetic TAG2 ,  TAG2 antiepileptic TAG2 ,  TAG2 anti-inflammatory TAG2 ,  TAG2 analgesic TAG2  and  TAG2 antipyretic TAG2  properties of  TAG2  TAG2 cannabis sativa TAG2  TAG2 , and used it extensively as medication from the 8th to 18th centuries. TAG2  TAG2 [96] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 landrace strains TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 evolution of cultivated cannabis strains. the  TAG2 cultivar TAG2 ,  TAG2 cannabis ruderalis TAG2 , still grows wild today. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cannabis seeds may have been used for food, rituals or religious practices in ancient europe and china. TAG2  TAG2 [97] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 : TAG2 19–22 TAG2  TAG2  harvesting the plant led to the spread of cannabis throughout  TAG2 eurasia TAG2  about 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, with further distribution to the  TAG2 middle east TAG2  and africa about 2,000 to 500 years ago. TAG2  TAG2 [97] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 : TAG2 18–19 TAG2  TAG2  a  TAG2 landrace TAG2  TAG2 strain TAG2  of cannabis developed over centuries. TAG2  TAG2 [98] TAG2  TAG2  they are cultivars of the plant that originated in one specific region. TAG1  TAG1 widely cultivated strains of cannabis, such as &quot;afghani&quot; or &quot;hindu kush&quot;, are indigenous to the  TAG2 pakistan TAG2  and  TAG2 afghanistan TAG2  regions, while &quot;durban poison&quot; is native to africa. TAG2  TAG2 [97] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 : TAG2 45–48 TAG2  TAG2  there are approximately 16 landrace strains of cannabis identified from pakistan, jamaica, africa, mexico, central america and asia. TAG2  TAG2 [99] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 modern TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 an irish physician,  TAG2 william brooke o'shaughnessy TAG2 , is credited with introducing cannabis to western medicine. TAG2  TAG2 [100] TAG2  TAG2  o'shaughnessy discovered cannabis in the 1830s while living abroad in  TAG2 india TAG2 , where he conducted numerous experiments investigating the drug's medical utility (noting in particular its  TAG2 analgesic TAG2  and  TAG2 anticonvulsant TAG2  effects). TAG2  TAG2 [101] TAG2  TAG2   he returned to  TAG2 england TAG2  with a supply of cannabis in 1842, after which its use spread through europe and the united states. TAG2  TAG2 [102] TAG2  TAG2   cannabis was entered into the  TAG2 united states pharmacopeia TAG2  in 1850. TAG2  TAG2 [101] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the use of cannabis in medicine began to decline by the end of the 19th century, due to difficulty in controlling dosages and the rise in popularity of synthetic and  TAG2 opium TAG2 -derived drugs. TAG2  TAG2 [102] TAG2  TAG2   also, the advent of the hypodermic  TAG2 syringe TAG2  allowed these drugs to be injected for immediate effect, in contrast to cannabis which is not water-soluble and therefore cannot be injected. TAG2  TAG2 [102] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in the united states, the medical use of cannabis further declined with the passage of the  TAG2 marihuana tax act of 1937 TAG2 , which imposed new regulations and fees on physicians prescribing cannabis. TAG2  TAG2 [103] TAG2  TAG2   cannabis was removed from the u.s. pharmacopeia in 1941, and officially banned for any use with the passage of the  TAG2 controlled substances act TAG2  of 1970. TAG2  TAG2 [102] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cannabis began to attract renewed interest as medicine in the 1970s and 1980s, in particular due to its use by cancer and aids patients who reported relief from the effects of  TAG2 chemotherapy TAG2  and  TAG2 wasting syndrome TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [104] TAG2  TAG2   in 1996,  TAG2 california TAG2  became the first u.s. state to legalize medical cannabis in defiance of federal law. TAG2  TAG2 [105] TAG2  TAG2   in 2001,  TAG2 canada TAG2  became the first country to adopt a system regulating the medical use of cannabis. TAG2  TAG2 [106] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the use of cannabis, at least as fiber, has been shown to go back at least 10,000 years in  TAG2 taiwan TAG2 . &quot;dà má&quot; ( TAG2 pinyin TAG2  pronunciation) is the chinese expression for cannabis, the first character meaning &quot;big&quot; and the second character meaning &quot;hemp&quot;.

TAG2  TAG2 [109] TAG2  TAG2   other countries have more restrictive laws that allow only the use of isolated cannabinoid drugs such as  TAG2 sativex TAG2  or  TAG2 epidiolex TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [129] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [130] TAG2  TAG2   countries with the most relaxed policies include canada, TAG2  TAG2 [131] TAG2  TAG2  uruguay, TAG2  TAG2 [109] TAG2  TAG2  and the netherlands, TAG2  TAG2 [109] TAG2  TAG2  where cannabis can be purchased without need for a prescription.  in  TAG2 mexico TAG2 , thc content of medical cannabis is limited to one percent. TAG2  TAG2 [132] TAG2  TAG2   the same limit applies in  TAG2 switzerland TAG2 , but no prescription is required to purchase. TAG2  TAG2 [133] TAG2  TAG2   in the  TAG2 united states TAG2 , the legality of medical cannabis varies by state. TAG2  TAG2 [12] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cannabis is in schedule iv of the united nations'  TAG2 single convention on narcotic drugs TAG2 , making it subject to special restrictions. article 2 provides for the following, in reference to schedule iv drugs: TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 a party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in, possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including clinical trials therewith to be conducted under or subject to the direct supervision and control of the party. TAG2  TAG2 [134] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 the convention thus allows countries to outlaw cannabis for all non-research purposes but lets nations choose to allow use for medical and scientific purposes if they believe total prohibition is not the most appropriate means of protecting health and welfare. the convention requires that states that permit the production or use of medical cannabis must operate a licensing system for all cultivators, manufacturers, and distributors and ensure that the total cannabis market of the state shall not exceed that required &quot;for medical and scientific purposes&quot;. TAG2  TAG2 [134] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 united states TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 see also:  TAG2 medical cannabis in the united states TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in the united states, the use of cannabis for medical purposes is legal in 33 states, four out of five permanently inhabited  TAG2 u.s. territories TAG2 , and the  TAG2 district of columbia TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [12] TAG2  TAG2   an additional 14 states have more restrictive laws allowing the use of low-thc products.

TAG2  often, that’s not so. a few users have a medical marijuana doctor who walks them through products and shows them how to use a vape pen. but that’s unusual. “older people think there will be a prescription waiting for them at the dispensary, like at a drugstore,” says rick mcknight, 72, a retired sales executive from ocala, florida, who self-treats hip pain with marijuana. “it’s not like that. you get your medical marijuana card. the doctor gives you some recommendations — not a prescription. then you’re on your own.” TAG1  TAG1 2. dispensaries carry a dizzying variety of products TAG1  TAG1 it’s like a trip to an adults-only candy store, loaded with tinctures and oils, vape pens and “flower” (dried marijuana), mouth sprays and skin patches, fancy chocolate truffles, cinnamon-scented cookies, and sodas, balms and lotions, all laced with the active ingredients in cannabis. you’ll also find high-strength concentrates, waxes and resins. what’s on sale differs by state, and free samples and in-store use are against the law.  TAG1  TAG1 3. today’s cannabis is super-potent TAG1  TAG1 “this is not the marijuana people smoked in dorm rooms in the 1970s,” says staci gruber, the director of the marijuana investigations for neuroscientific discovery (mind) program at harvard-affiliated mclean hospital in belmont, massachusetts. “you have to be careful.” clandestine marijuana growers have for decades been cross-breeding and selecting the highest-potency plants to create more powerful pot. levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or thc — the compound responsible for marijuana’s euphoric highs — in cannabis averaged 4 percent in 1995 and rose to 17 percent by 2017, studies show. it hasn’t stopped there. you can buy sealed bags and rolled joints featuring marijuana strains topping 28 percent thc, and concentrates with 85 to 90 percent. fortunately, plenty of products that are low in thc and high in cannabidiol, or cbd — the other major cannabis compound — are available. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 note: potency varies by strain and form, and it can often be tough to gauge a patient's tolerance. so before a patient engages in a cannabis-based medical treatment, he or she should consult their doctor and approach with caution; there’s limited scientific research and, as with any medication, the effects vary by user. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 4. edibles only  TAG2 seem TAG2  low-risk TAG1  TAG1 hey, it’s just candy, right QUESTION  but that rainbow-hued gummy bear or little chocolate square could contain 10 milligrams of thc, plus cbd. that’s three to four times the amount experts recommend for older adults. “edibles take from 30 minutes to four hours to take effect. it’s easy to eat more because you aren’t feeling anything after a few minutes,” says danielle fixen, an assistant professor in the university of colorado’s pharmacy school. “but then the effects last six to eight hours.” TAG1  TAG1 5. there’s not enough good science about the effect on humans TAG1  TAG1 and the main reason for that research gap is that at the federal level, cannabis — medical or recreational — is an illegal schedule i controlled substance, legally on par with heroin, lsd and street fentanyl. that’s why doctors can’t technically prescribe it; they can only give you state-required permission to use it. more important, scientists can’t buy it at a dispensary and study it in most labs. that research gap means only a handful of the common uses of cannabis are backed by substantial evidence from human clinical trials, according to a rigorous 2017 report from the national academies of sciences, engineering and medicine (nasem). other popular uses — including for dementia, cancer, fibromyalgia, glaucoma, depression and even insomnia — are less solid, the nasem experts say. their bottom line (albeit two years old): “conclusive evidence regarding the short- and long-term health effects (harms and benefits) of cannabis use remains elusive.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cannabis: where is it legal QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1  aarp TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 under federal law, all cannabis is illegal to sell, possess or use. the feds, however, are reluctant to enforce the prohibition in the face of mounting support by states. thirty-three states (plus the district of columbia, guam, puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands) permit medical marijuana for qualifying patients; a doctor’s certification and patient card are generally required. state laws differ on such critical questions as who can grow it, who can sell it and what health conditions qualify. eleven states and the district of columbia allow recreational marijuana use. TAG1  TAG1 under federal law, cbd (cannabidiol) derived from marijuana, which contains the psychoactive ingredient thc, is illegal; hemp-derived cbd that contains no more than 0.3 percent thc is legal to sell and consume — though the u.s. food and drug administration says it is illegal to market cbd in food and supplements. thirteen states have passed laws allowing the sale of cbd/low thc products. details vary: check your state’s laws for the latest info. for more information see the  TAG2 national conference of state legislatures TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 6. marijuana’s stoner stigma persists TAG1  TAG1 whether it’s a holdover from america’s decades-long war on drugs or pot’s still-illegal federal status, many older proponents of medical marijuana continue to hide their use. the lingering stigma associated with pot keeps some people from telling their doctor, too, says hillary lum, a geriatrician and associate professor at the university of colorado school of medicine. “in a recent survey, 30 percent of older adults didn’t answer the question about whether or not they used medical marijuana,” she says. “if people feel uncomfortable with it on an anonymous survey, they may also feel uncomfortable telling their doctor. that could have ramifications for their health.” TAG1  TAG1 7. many doctors are in a quandary TAG1  TAG1 half of the primary care doctors working at mayo clinic medical offices said in a 2019 survey that they weren’t prepared to answer patients’ questions about medical marijuana — even though 58 percent believed it was a legitimate medical therapy for terminal illnesses, untreatable pain and cancer symptoms. TAG1  TAG1 that hasn’t stopped some users — especially older adults — from approaching their doctors. TAG1  TAG1 “my patients want to talk about it,” lum says. “but i’m in an information vacuum. we don’t have many clinical studies to show effectiveness. medical schools, pharmacy schools and nursing schools haven’t taught it. it’s not in the pharmacy database we use for prescribing, so i don’t have a lot of information about potential drug interactions and side effects.” TAG1  TAG1 a few institutions have declined to embrace its use. the cleveland clinic announced it would not recommend medical marijuana to its patients when it became legal to buy in ohio in january. says paul terpeluk, a doctor of osteopathic medicine and medical director of the cleveland clinic’s employee health services, “we’re just beginning to understand the effects of cannabinoids in the body. we do not believe states should be in the business of regulating and promoting medications.” TAG1  TAG1 but other doctors prefer not to create obstacles to medical marijuana use. peter grinspoon, a primary care physician at massachusetts general hospital and a harvard medical school instructor, took the unusual step of getting trained so he could certify his patients as medical marijuana users.  TAG1  TAG1 “i grew up with this, so it’s hard not seeing it as medicine,” grinspoon explains. his father, the harvard psychiatrist lester grinspoon, is considered the “grandfather of medical marijuana” and wrote a book about the history and cultural use of medical marijuana in the 1970s; there’s even a marijuana strain in europe named after him. his brother used marijuana while battling leukemia, too. TAG1  TAG1 “it makes sense to try cannabis when you consider the track record of other medications a lot of older adults take, especially for pain, sleep and anxiety,” grinspoon says. “nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and naproxen can affect your kidneys, threaten your heart and cause gastrointestinal bleeding. few people want to be on opiates — they haven’t proven to work well for long-term relief, you get constipated and they can be addictive. sleep and anxiety drugs can leave you sedated and may affect memory. cannabis can be as effective as anything.” TAG1  TAG1 even nursing homes are experiencing a profound shift toward acceptance. one program at the hebrew home in riverdale, new york, allows residents to use cannabis capsules or cannabis oil drops and has found that it eases pain, improves appetite and even reduced one resident’s opioid use. the program stays compliant with federal rules by having residents buy and administer cannabis themselves or with the help of a caregiver who’s not on the home’s staff. TAG1  TAG1 “the benefits are nothing short of amazing and should be more widely available to residents of long-term care facilities,” says daniel reingold, the ceo of riverspring health, which operates the hebrew home. the nursing home is now leading a group of nonprofit long-term care facilities in several states planning to launch a large study this fall of medical marijuana’s effects in older adults. TAG1  TAG1 (note: the purchase of medical marijuana from a dispensary is not covered by the u.s. department of veterans affairs, medicare, medicaid or private insurance, though in some cases all may cover fda-approved prescription drugs, such as marinol, that are based on cannabis.) TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 where aarp stands TAG1  TAG1 in march, the aarp board of directors approved a policy supporting the medical use of marijuana for older adults in states that have legalized it. the decision was based on the growing body of research suggesting marijuana may be helpful in treating certain medical conditions and symptoms. the policy also notes that decisions related to the use of medical marijuana should be made between a patient and a health care provider and appropriately balance clinical evidence of benefit and harm, the patient’s preferences and values, and any laws that may apply. TAG1  TAG1 according to the policy, “aarp also supports further clinical research of medical use of cannabinoids to help alleviate both the symptoms of disease and the side effects of the treatment for diseases.” the policy adds that “aarp believes the dea’s [drug enforcement administration] classification of marijuana as a schedule i controlled substance deters the medical use and scientific study of cannabinoids” and calls on federal officials to examine options to allow more clinical research.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 en español TAG2  | evaluating medical marijuana research disease by disease is not easy, hampered as it is by the federal government’s ban on government-supported data collection. observational studies — in which users simply report their experiences — may look rosy. animal and test-tube studies also can sound promising. but plenty of stuff that helps mice or a clump of cells in a petri dish may not help us humans. despite these obstacles, there are some conditions and diseases for which cannabis is clearly a useful treatment. others, not so much. TAG1  TAG1 chronic pain TAG1  TAG1 more than 600,000 americans turn to cannabis for relief from chronic pain — and the scientific evidence for its effectiveness is substantial. in gold-standard randomized clinical trials of people who had agonizing health concerns — peripheral neuropathy (nerve pain from diabetes), spinal cord injury, hiv or complex regional pain syndrome, cancer, chemotherapy, muscle and joint problems, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis — cannabis reduced pain by 40 percent, according to the 2017 nasem report. TAG1  TAG1 in a recent canadian study, cannabis even soothed arthritic lab rats. surprisingly, there’s little evidence (yet) from human studies for the most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis — the wear-and-tear joint disease affecting 50 percent of adults age 65-plus. clinical trials are underway. but who’s waiting QUESTION  arthritis was the top reason older adults used cannabis in a 2019 colorado survey, followed by back pain. overall, 79 percent said it helped.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 bottom line: it seems to help TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 insomnia TAG1  TAG1 the national academies rate scientific proof for better sleep on cannabis as only “moderate” in people with health conditions that interfere with slumber. but that’s not slowing down older users. more than 1 in 3 people in a colorado survey tried it for sleep; 86 percent said it helped. by plugging into cannabinoid receptors on brain cells, thc and cbd could possibly team up for better sleep, at least in the short term, in people with insomnia due to pain, obstructive sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis and anxiety. TAG1  TAG1 but beware: choosing cannabis for sleep can be tricky. a little thc helps, but too much could keep you awake. too little cbd could interfere with good sleep, while a bigger dose may help you snooze longer with fewer overnight wake-ups, a recent palo alto university review says. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 bottom line: it seems to help TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 depression, anxiety and ptsd TAG1  TAG1 lifting low moods and calming chronic tension brought 1 in 5 older adults in a recent survey to medical cannabis. more than 90 percent said it helped. meanwhile, treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is emerging as another top use. TAG1  TAG1 so far, data for all of these mental health issues is sparse. we’ll know more soon. at least seven studies of cannabis in anxiety and/or depression are in the works in the united states and around the world. so are at least six studies for ptsd.  TAG1  TAG1 for now, small studies and surveys hint at benefits and problems — especially for depression. the good news: in a 2018 washington state university online survey of 3,151 medical marijuana users with depression, in-the-moment symptoms improved by 50 percent after just two puffs of generally low-thc, high-cbd pot. as with any drug, dosage matters: more wasn’t better. the bad news: over time, their ongoing depression worsened somewhat. regular use may change cannabinoid receptors in the brain, boosting vulnerability to dark moods, the researchers note. stopping can reverse it. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 note: potency varies by strain and form, and it can often be tough to gauge a patient's tolerance. so before a patient engages in a cannabis-based medical treatment, he or she should consult their doctor and approach with caution; there’s limited scientific research and, as with any medication, the effects vary by user. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the picture looks brighter for anxiety — if you choose your cannabis carefully. in a 2018 study, volunteers who used cannabis reduced their use of commonly prescribed anxiety-reducing benzodiazepines by 47 percent. users are enthusiastic. “anxiety can really increase as you get older,” notes barbara blaser, 73, a nurse navigator who helps teach older cannabis users at magnolia wellness dispensary in oakland, california. “your kids are far away, your friends are passing away, you don’t know what will happen next in your life. a small amount of cannabis can help you feel better. right now, i’m using a gel pen that delivers a tiny dab to my skin. it sinks in and i relax.”  TAG1  TAG1 quantity matters: a little bit (7.5 milligrams of thc, less than the content of many edibles) reduced stress in a 2017 study. but 12.5 milligrams (what you’d get from a few puffs of the popular pot strain gsc (formerly girl scout cookies) increased anxiety. TAG1  TAG1 cannabis has potential for people with ptsd. thc and cbd may soften “fear memories” that flood the brain in response to ptsd triggers (such as a sudden loud noise), say researchers from the national center for ptsd in palo alto, california. taking thc at night meant fewer and less intense nightmares for 47 people with ptsd in a 2009 clinical trial in canada.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 bottom line: depression  TAG2 —  TAG2 mixed success; anxiety — seems to help; ptsd  TAG2 —  TAG2 seems to help TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 multiple sclerosis TAG1  TAG1 nearly 1 million americans, including many 45 and older, live with the debilitating muscle spasms and pain of multiple sclerosis. up to 66 percent of them may be using medical marijuana, a 2017 survey found. it’s likely they’ve cut back on ms medications, too. in fact, people with ms are the second-largest group of medical marijuana users in the u.s., behind chronic pain sufferers. there’s substantial science for cannabis’ ability to reduce ms muscle spasms. meanwhile, others are looking at a potential cannabis-based drug for ms. the cannabis research and development company mmj international holdings corp. hopes to test an experimental medication — a highly purified, liquid plant extract with thc and cbd in a gelatin capsule — for ms in the u.s. soon.    TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 bottom line: it seems to help TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cancer pain TAG1  TAG1 cannabis is highly effective for cancer pain and the side effects of cancer treatment — nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight loss, says donald abrams, an oncologist and professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco and a longtime advocate of medical marijuana. “there’s no question in my mind, it works,” abrams says. “i was on the nasem committee that reviewed the evidence.” TAG1  TAG1 the uses with the strongest evidence in the medical literature were for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and cancer pain. “i work with patients undergoing cancer therapy,” abrams says. “i tell them, ‘go to the dispensary, tell them what you’re trying to treat, and ask what works best.’ ”  TAG1  TAG1 but cannabis should never be used to treat cancer, abrams says. “the saddest and most frustrating thing for me is to meet patients who’ve delayed coming in for six months because they heard marijuana treats cancer and they wanted to try it first. for some, it’s too late for proven treatments like surgery, chemotherapy and radiation that extend and save lives.” don’t fall for hints online that it does work, he notes — they’re based on sketchy anecdotes and questionable research, like one tiny human study that dripped cannabis into the brains of people with brain cancer. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 bottom line: it seems to help TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 other conditions TAG1  TAG1 older adults are using medical marijuana for dozens of other health concerns, including migraines, fibromyalgia, symptoms of alzheimer’s disease and dementia, parkinson’s disease, crohn’s disease and glaucoma. some show promise. medical marijuana reduced the frequency and intensity of migraines in one study. a study of 2,700 older patients in israel gave cannabis high marks for reducing pain and improving quality of life for those with alzheimer’s, parkinson’s, crohn’s and ulcerative colitis. meanwhile, experts say that when it comes to glaucoma, do not rely on marijuana. it’s important to stick with proven treatments like eye drops. far more research and anecdotal weight is needed before there are definitive answers on these uses.

TAG1  TAG1 currently,  TAG2 more than 60 TAG2  u.s. and international health organizations — including the american public health association, health canada and the federation of american scientists — support granting patients immediate legal access to medicinal marijuana under a physician’s supervision. several others, including the american cancer society and the american medical association support the facilitation of wide-scale, clinical research trials so that physicians may better assess cannabis’ medical potential. TAG1  TAG1 in addition, a  TAG2 1991 harvard study TAG2  found that 44 percent of oncologists had previously advised marijuana therapy to their patients. fifty percent responded they would do so if marijuana was legal. a more recent national survey performed by researchers at providence rhode island hospital found that nearly half of physicians with opinions supported legalizing medical marijuana. TAG1  TAG1 safety and efficacy TAG1  TAG1 cannabis and its psychoactive cannabinoid, thc, are considered incredibly safe for human consumption. the  TAG2 drug awareness warning network annual report TAG2 , published by the substance abuse and mental health services administration (samhsa), contains a statistical compilation of all drug deaths which occur in the united states. according to this report, there has never been a death recorded from the use of cannabis. in fact, many studies show it is physically impossible for a human to die from a  TAG2 cannabis overdose TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 the documented use of cannabis as a safe and effective therapeutic botanical dates to 2700 bc. between 1840 and 1900, european and american journals of medicine published more than 100 articles on the  TAG2 therapeutic use of cannabis TAG2 . in fact, cannabis was part of the american pharmacopoeia until 1942, and is currently available by prescription in canada, the netherlands, israel, and germany. TAG1  TAG1 therapeutic benefits TAG1  TAG1 the cannabis plant has been around for centuries. it is believed to have originated in central asia, but has expanded its reach to an international scale over time. people all around the globe consume cannabis and their reasoning is largely the same: it makes them feel better. TAG1  TAG1 we know that humans have cannabinoid receptors housed inside the body that are ready to bind with cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant to provide therapeutic benefits for a  TAG2 variety of ailments TAG2 . in fact, cannabinoid receptors are present in humans before birth and the compounds themselves are even found in a mother’s  TAG2 breast milk TAG2 . medical cannabis gains merit when you consider our bodies are naturally tuned to interact with cannabinoids, and even more so when you acknowledge the growing evidence of benefits to cannabis consumption. TAG1  TAG1 cannabis &amp; digestion TAG1  TAG1 it is no secret – experiencing “the munchies” is one of the most obvious cannabis clichés. despite the silly connotation, studies suggest that the endocannabinoid system actually helps  TAG2 modulate appetite TAG2 . this is especially interesting for the treatment of eating disorders. in fact, a study published in the  TAG2 international journal of eating disorders TAG2  suggests that cannabinoids may prove effective in treating  TAG2 anorexia TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 cannabis is also famously used to reduce the feelings of  TAG2 nausea TAG2  but studies suggest it could have a number of digestive benefits as well. medical marijuana could play a role in a number of digestion-related health conditions including: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 diabetes and cannabis TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 medical marijuana for pain management TAG1  TAG1 chronic pain is one of the most common ailments for which doctors prescribe medical marijuana and a recent survey published in  TAG2  TAG2 the spine journal TAG2  TAG2  found that 1 out of 5 patients at a colorado spine center were using cannabis to manage their pain. of those, nearly 90% said it greatly or moderately relieved their pain. TAG1  TAG1 the spine clinic study was merely a survey, which means more research will be necessary on the potential role of cannabis in treating back pain. with that said, plenty of people will tell you it helps manage pain and science is beginning to back their claims. studies suggest medical marijuana could offer relief for various types of pain, including the following: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 neuropathic pain and cannabis TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cannabis &amp; mental health TAG1  TAG1 a common misconception of cannabis is that has detrimental effects on mental health. it is possible that high doses of  TAG2 tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) TAG2  could trigger anxiety in some patients, and some believe it could expedite the onset of predisposed personality disorders, but this has yet to be proven by any reputable studies. TAG1  TAG1 the recent trend in the mental health field has been to investigate our relationship with cannabis. in turn, studies have linked cannabinoids to a number of mental health concerns. the research catalog is still growing, but a few mental health conditions for which cannabis could be beneficial are as follows: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 migraines and cannabis TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 medical marijuana for cancer TAG1  TAG1 one the most intriguing potential applications for medical marijuana is cancer treatment. it has long been prescribed to counter the side effects of  TAG2 chemotherapy TAG2 , but oncologists across the world are working on trials to determine whether cannabis can be used to treat cancer itself. many patients choose to take the  TAG2 rick simpson oil treatment plan TAG2  in an attempt to cure the cancer, but there are many different methods of going about treatment. TAG1  TAG1 past research showed promise for thc in cancer treatment, but many are skeptical of using thc-based products because of its psychotropic effects (eg. the “high”). as a result many oncologists have redirected their focus toward  TAG2 cannabidiol (cbd) TAG2  and  TAG2 cannabigerol (cbg) TAG2 . a recent british study, however suggests that cannabinoids may be most  TAG2 effective against cancer TAG2  when combined in a manner that allows them to act synergistically with one-another. below is a short list of studies and research supporting cancer treatment with medical cannabis to get you started: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","NOT"

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the science behind marijuana TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 what is the science and pharmacology behind marijuana, and can it be used to treat parkinson's symptoms QUESTION    TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2 endocannabinoid system TAG2  is located in the brain and made up of cannabinoid receptors (a receptor is molecular switch on the outside of a cell that makes something happen inside a cell when activated) that are linked to  TAG2 neurons TAG2  (brain cells) that regulate thinking and some body functions. TAG1  TAG1 researchers began to show enthusiasm to study cannabis in relation to pd after people with pd gave anecdotal reports and posted on social media as to how cannabis allegedly reduced their tremors. some researchers think that cannabis might be neuroprotective— saving neurons from damage caused by pd.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cannabinoids  TAG2 (the drug molecules in marijuana) have also been studied for use in treating other symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness caused by pd) and dyskinesia (excess movement caused by levodopa). despite some promising preclinical findings, researchers have not found any meaningful or conclusive benefits of cannabis for people with pd. TAG1  TAG1 researchers issue caution for people with pd who use cannabis because of its effect on thinking. pd can impair the executive function — the ability to make plans and limit risky behavior. people with a medical condition that impairs executive function should be cautious about using any medication that can compound this effect. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 the pharmacology of cannabis TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 marijuana contains more than 100 neuroactive chemicals that work with two types of cannabinoid receptors,  TAG2 type 1 (cb1) TAG2  located in the brain and  TAG2 type 2 (cb2) TAG2  located in the brain and peripheral immune system. cannabinoids have powerful, indirect effects on these receptors, but researchers are unsure how. people with pd have less cb1 receptors than people who do not have pd. a boost to the cb1 receptor through an agonist, like marijuana, can improve tremors and may alleviate dyskinesia. similarly, the other receptor, cb2, is also being studied to determine if it can modify the disease or provide neuroprotective benefits. however, a unified hypothesis does not currently exist for either receptor because there is too much conflicting data on the effectiveness of cannabinoids and these receptors. TAG1  TAG1 cannabis can contain two different types of molecules that interact with cannabinoid receptors: agonists and antagonists. an  TAG2 agonist TAG2  is a drug that attaches to the same receptor as a natural chemical and causes the same effect. a  TAG2 dopamine agonist TAG2  is a drug that is not dopamine, but attaches to the dopamine receptor. an  TAG2 antagonist TAG2  is different as it attaches to the receptor, but blocks the action of the natural chemical. medical marijuana can contain both cannabinoid agonists  TAG2 and TAG2  antagonists. recreational marijuana use is derived from its effects on agonists. TAG1  TAG1 the varying amounts of cannabinoid agonists and antagonists in different marijuana plants makes cannabis studies difficult to conduct. when researchers study the effects of a medication, dosages are controlled and often set to a specific number of milligrams. when testing medical marijuana, the dosage administered can vary dramatically depending on the plant and method of administration. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol (thc)  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 thc is a primary component of marijuana. cannabidiol is the other primary component. thc has a long latency of onset and cannot be easily measured for a therapeutic or medicinal dose. medical marijuana studies primarily provide participants with thc and/or cannabidiol as a capsule, nasal spray or liquid formulation. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 pd-related medicinal marijuana trials TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the use of cannabinoids has been suggested to help with managing neurological and non-neurological conditions. literature on medical marijuana is incredibly varied. studies have not clearly supported the use of marijuana for pd. the clinical studies of cannabis as a pd treatment that have been conducted did not use the clinical trial gold standard of a double blind, placebo controlled trial design. some studies had as few as five subjects. TAG1  TAG1 while some results have been positive, the effects of medical marijuana are probably not completely understood, which is why more studies, especially those with more subjects, are needed. most doctors don’t support study results because these studies do not meet minimum research standards. TAG1  TAG1 below are several pd-related medical marijuana studies that have been conducted to evaluate the use of cannabinoids: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for movement disorders TAG2 : clinical observations and trials of cannabinoid-based therapies suggest a possible benefit to tics and probably no benefit for tremor in dyskinesias or pd motor symptoms. further preclinical and clinical research is needed to better characterize the pharmacological, physiological and therapeutic effects of this class of drugs in movement disorders.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 						cbd is all the rage among patients. it’s launching their physicians into uncharted territory					 TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 today, cannabis is legal for medical use in  TAG2 33 states and the district of columbia TAG2 . that sounds great, but it is complicated by the mismatch between state and federal laws and by education for both medical students and practicing physicians. medical marijuana may have come to the states, but there is no integration with the medical community. patients get their information from friends and the media, and are left largely at the mercy of marijuana vendors. TAG1  TAG1 advertisement TAG1  TAG1 as i grappled with tendonitis in my elbow, back pain from a horseback riding injury, neck pain from past cancer treatment, and trouble sleeping, to name a few of my current ailments, i decided to do my own research and apply for a medical marijuana card. after what i have seen with the opioid crisis, i was open to trying something different than those potentially risky medications. though the internet can be a valuable resource, it is also filled with misinformation, so i hoped to receive more education and guidance as a medical marijuana patient. TAG1  TAG1 finding a doctor who would certify me as a medical marijuana patient with a qualifying condition was the first step. most physicians haven’t registered to do this, and my primary care physician was no exception. that forced me to search the internet for a clinic and doctor that would give me the certification in my state of massachusetts. TAG1  TAG1 after sifting through the various websites, i found what looked to be a reputable clinic and set up an appointment. the doctor was pleasant, gave me an overview of cannabis and a booklet of information, and completed my certification with the state. i mentioned to him that i had read about cannabis interacting with certain medications, like the statin i was on for my high cholesterol, and he seemed surprised, saying he knew nothing about it. that didn’t infuse me with confidence. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 						access to medical cannabis: a new health care disparity					 TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as i visited different dispensaries, i realized that the people behind the counter were giving me advice based on their personal experiences, and didn’t know anything about the risk of using cannabis with various medical conditions, or its interactions with medications. TAG1  TAG1 i was told about concentrate, distillate, and flower; about 1:1, 3:1, and 20:1 cbd to thc ratios; about sativa, indica, and hybrid — all terms i tried to understand. and then there were the crazy names given to the bud: cornbread, rainmaker, grease monkey. although the salesperson was patient with me and gave advice, i left the dispensary more confused than when i arrived. TAG1  TAG1 i now have a drawer full of marijuana-related tinctures, vape pens, cartridges, gummies, lozenges, chocolates, and medicated creams. my husband wants to know what i am going to do with it all. i have tried some of these products, but i haven’t smoked or vaped marijuana given my past medical history, and want more information about whether it will harm me by doing so. the learning curve is so steep and dosages so random. you have to figure it out on your own, as everyone responds differently. TAG1  TAG1 the “on your own” part is a shame. cancer patients, pain patients, and others now have an alternative way to combat symptoms, one that may cause fewer side effects and come with a lower opportunity for abuse, yet their doctors generally can’t give them guidance on how to use it because they haven’t been trained to do that. patients at cancer centers are desperate for advice but have to go outside the medical system, even for “medical marijuana.” as both a cancer patient and patient advocate, i am worried about patients not receiving the support they need in this area. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 						watch: an introduction to cbd — and what washington might do about it					 TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 on a recent visit to a major teaching hospital in boston, a nurse practitioner told me how desperate patients are to learn about and use cannabis. i was shocked to hear there is no designated physician or other health care professional in that hospital who can authoritatively have these discussions. “the protocol is to write a prescription for sleeping pills or anti-anxiety or pain meds,” she said, rather than have a discussion about cannabis. “no one wants to be known as the ‘pot doctor’ or take the risk of recommending marijuana.” TAG1  TAG1 there is clearly a need for more research and education around marijuana, for both patients and their doctors. but the research we need isn’t happening because of marijuana’s current federal classification as an illegal substance, despite the fact that individual states have legalized it. this is bad news for patients for two main reasons. TAG1  TAG1 first, doctors rely on research. without it, they are not only resistant to recommend cannabis but have no real science to inform their decisions. so they mostly stay out of the conversation. people are told to talk to their doctor about using cannabis, yet when i mention it to my doctors they typically shrug and say they can’t give me any guidance. others tell you to stay away from marijuana. these approaches make me worry that patients will keep their usage secret rather than share what they are doing with a disapproving doctor. TAG1  TAG1 second, without research there is no real safety profile or guidelines for usage and dosage. patients are left to experiment on their own. TAG1  TAG1 we may have put the cart before the horse by classifying cannabis for medical use before physicians truly understand its benefits. this creates confusion and a lack of support and potential harm for patients. i believe that physicians should manage a persons’ care holistically, but the current environment makes that difficult to do. TAG1  TAG1 until there’s some real change, like making it easier to study the effects of medical marijuana and also training doctors about its benefits and risks, we will all continue to be dazed and confused.

TAG1  TAG1 helps with adhd/add TAG1  TAG1 individuals with adhd and add have trouble focusing on tasks at hand. they tend to have problems with cognitive performance and concentration.  TAG2 cannabis TAG2  has shown promise in promoting focus and helping individuals with adhd/add. it is also considered a safer alternative to adderall and ritalin. TAG1  TAG1 treatment for glaucoma TAG1  TAG1 glaucoma leads to additional pressure on the eyeball which is painful for individuals with the disorder. cannabis can help reduce the pressure applied on the eyeball providing some temporary relief to individuals with glaucoma. TAG1  TAG1 alleviate anxiety TAG1  TAG1 while cannabis is commonly known to cause anxiety, there is a way around that. taken in monitored dosage and in the proper way, cannabis can help alleviate anxiety and calm users down. TAG1  TAG1 slow development of alzheimer’s disease TAG1  TAG1 alzheimer’s disease is one of many that is caused by cognitive degeneration. as we age, cognitive degeneration is almost unavoidable. cannabis’s endocannabinoid contains anti-inflammatories that fight the brain inflammation that leads to alzheimer’s disease. TAG1  TAG1 deal with pain linked to arthritis TAG1  TAG1 cannabis is now commonly found as creams and balms which are used by individuals that have arthritis. both thc and cbd help sufferers deal with the pain.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  low-thc medical cannabis TAG2 the active ingredient of low-thc medical cannabis is cannabidiol (cbd). this treatment does not cause the euphoric effects typically attributed to cannabis consumption. cbd appears to be non-toxic to humans, though some mild side effects have been reported, including increased sleepiness, fatigue, diarrhea, and change in appetite. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 thc-containing medical cannabis TAG2 thc is the ingredient that causes the euphoric/psychoactive effects of cannabis. the doses needed to provide relief for the patient will vary, and with this, so can the euphoric effect. cbd should also be an ingredient of this treatment as it works synergistically with the thc, and also can decrease the euphoric effects of the thc. this allows for higher doses of thc to be used by lowering the side-effects of the thc. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 strains, hybrids, and ratios TAG2  TAG2 the medical marijuana treatment centers are taking different approaches to the types of cannabis products they offer. because patients react differently to the various thc-containing plants, some centers differentiate their products based on whether it is derived from a sativa, indica, or hybrid plant. some centers indicate the individual strain of the plant and offer more than one strain of any given type (i.e., sativa). additionally, many centers offer combination products with various ratios of cbd to thc.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 created by  TAG2 findlaw's team TAG2  of legal writers and editors TAG2  TAG2 | last updated june 27, 2019 TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the term &quot;medical marijuana&quot; refers to the use, possession, and/or cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes. people who are terminally ill, or suffer from painful or long-term symptoms associated with certain diseases, such as epilepsy, aids, glaucoma, and cancer, often request medical marijuana as a form of treatment and/or pain relief. as a general principle, medical marijuana is no different than standard marijuana (or cannabis). TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 medical marijuana: state vs. federal law TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a growing number of  TAG2 states have legalized medical cannabis TAG2  within their borders. under the federal controlled substances act, however, marijuana is classified as a &quot;schedule i drug,&quot; meaning it: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 has the potential for abuse, TAG2  TAG2 has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the u.s., and TAG2  TAG2 has a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as such, there is a growing debate concerning the personal medical use of marijuana and its legality. TAG1  TAG1 on one side of the issue, some politicians and law enforcement officials would like to combat  TAG2 illegal drug use of marijuana TAG2  and control some of its effects, such as the &quot;wide open sale of marijuana under the guise of medical purpose.&quot; on the other side, some health advocates and other drug legalization groups would like to legalize the medical use of marijuana, believing that the drug is a valuable aid in the treatment of a wide range of medical conditions. TAG1  TAG1 the u.s. government shifted its attention to larger drug trafficking issues when the obama administration took over in 2009, with the department of justice stating it would not prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws on authorized users of medical marijuana or their caregivers. however, the doj resumed its prosecution of medical marijuana providers in 2011 and put pressure on publishers who run ads for medical marijuana dispensaries. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 medical marijuana laws TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 medical marijuana laws are constantly changing and vary among geographical location. both federal and state laws make it a crime to use, grow, sell, or possess marijuana. the federal supreme court TAG2 , TAG2  for example, has stated that it is illegal to use, sell or possess marijuana, even for medical use (in the 2005 case of  TAG2  TAG2 gonzales v. raich TAG2  TAG2 ). TAG1  TAG1 a growing number of states, however, have legalized the use and/or cultivation of marijuana for medical (and even recreational) purposes, thereby removing any criminal penalties from doctors who prescribe the drug or from patients who use it within the bounds set by state law. california was the first to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 when it passed proposition 215, also called the compassionate use act. the law allows the possession and cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes upon a doctor's recommendation. TAG1  TAG1 a majority of states have legalized medical marijuana, including the following: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 arizona TAG2  TAG2  - the state allows patients with a written certification from their doctor to possess up to 2.5 oz. of usable cannabis and the cultivation of up to 12 plants (no cultivation within 25 miles of a licensed dispensary). TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 florida TAG2  TAG2  - patients with a doctor's recommendation may possess a 70-day supply (exact amounts not specified) and aren't allowed to grow their own supply; dispensaries are licensed by the florida department of health. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 illinois TAG2  TAG2  - eligible patients must register with the state and may possess up to 2.5 oz. of usable cannabis; cultivation is not allowed under the law and patients must select a designated state-licensed dispensary. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 minnesota TAG2  TAG2  - eligible patients may possess a 30-day supply of  TAG2 non-smokable TAG2  cannabis (edibles and other such preparations), as determined by the patient's doctor; only licensed providers may cultivate the herb. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 oregon TAG2  TAG2  - patients with a signed doctor's recommendation may possess up to 24 oz. of usable marijuana and may cultivate up to 24 cannabis plants (only six may be mature). TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 these state medical marijuana laws typically set the boundaries under which the herb may be recommended, cultivated, possessed and used. for instance, states may require written documentation from a person's doctor affirming that the person suffers from a debilitating condition and might benefit from the medical use of marijuana. also, states may require people to present this documentation, or &quot;marijuana id card&quot; prior to an arrest. TAG1  TAG1 learn about state-specific laws on our  TAG2 drug and alcohol violations legal answers TAG2  page. TAG1  TAG1 other provisions may include limits on the  TAG2 type TAG2  of conditions, such as hiv and aids, and the  TAG2 amount TAG2  of marijuana that a person may possess, use, or grow. finally, some states have other specific provisions, such as employee restrictions on the medical use of marijuana at work and certain id card requirements and fees. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 medical marijuana penalties TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 penalties for medical marijuana violations may include prison time, fines, or both, depending on the nature of the offense and the state where the occurrence took place. in states that have not legalized the medical use of marijuana, the charges are treated as general misdemeanor or felony drug charges. TAG1  TAG1 in states which have  TAG2 decriminalized TAG2  medical marijuana, penalties in the form of prison or fines may still apply, yet offenses are often treated as minor civil infractions. TAG1  TAG1 for example, punishable circumstances may include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 possession over a certain amount (in grams); TAG2  TAG2 the sale of the drug to others, especially to or from a &quot;minor&quot;; TAG2  TAG2 the cultivation of the drug in states where cultivation is not allowed; and TAG2  TAG2 possession of marijuana paraphernalia. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 defenses: know your legal rights TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 patients who are arrested on drug charges might use their medical status  TAG2 as a defense TAG2 , before or during the trial, to help reduce any penalties. in addition, a patient may show a doctor's recommendation for marijuana to reduce penalties and help avoid jail time or fines altogether. finally, a patient may want to claim the defense of medical necessity based on the clinical nature of his or her health condition. TAG1  TAG1 it's important to check with a lawyer who specializes in medical marijuana cases to learn of your rights and responsibilities concerning the use and/or charges of medical marijuana. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 learn more about medical marijuana laws from an attorney TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 understanding the ramifications of state and federal marijuana convictions and other criminal sentences can be the key to your financial and personal freedom. for this reason, your best move is to speak with a  TAG2 criminal defense attorney TAG2  if you've been charged with a drug crime.

TAG1  TAG1 the specialization in school psychology, per the commission on teacher credentialing (ctc) authorizes the holder to perform the following duties: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 provide services that enhance academic performance TAG2  TAG2 design strategies and programs to address problems of adjustment TAG2  TAG2 consult with other educators and parents on issues of social development and behavioral and academic difficulties TAG2  TAG2 conduct psycho-educational assessment for purposes of identifying special needs TAG2  TAG2 provide psychological counseling for individuals, groups, and families TAG2  TAG2 coordinate intervention strategies for management of individuals and schoolwide crises TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 source:  TAG2 http://www.ctc.ca.gov/credentials/req-services.html TAG2  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what are the “permission” requirements in order for a school psychologist to provide counseling services to non-special education students in the public school setting QUESTION  TAG2   TAG2   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 school psychologists should obtain parental/guardian permission in the provision of psychological counseling. since school psychological services are not services regularly provided to all students as a general education function within the school, ferpa requires school psychologists to obtain parental/guardian permission for counseling services until the student’s age of 18. the exception to this is if the student is deemed mature enough to give their own consent/engage in counseling services and if seeking parental/guardian consent would put the student at increased risk or if the minor is emancipated. this caveat is clearly vague, and, therefore, consultation with administration and legal counsel in the specific district wherein services are to be provided is recommended as best practice. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is the school psychologist’s responsibility to maintain confidentiality QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 both the national association of school psychologists (nasp, 2010) and the american psychological association (apa, 2002) have set detailed guidelines around confidentiality. in situations wherein failure to release information would result in danger to the child or others (nasp, 2010), confidentiality must be breeched in order to ensure the safety of the child and those around him or her. in those situations, the therapist must use clinical judgment, knowledge of legal and ethical guidelines, and an understanding of risk factors that could increase harm to self or others in order to determine next steps. if the risk is deemed to be high, parents must be notified immediately and the high-risk student should be placed under constant supervision. the therapist must ensure that the parent understands the seriousness of the situation and should be prepared to guide the parent to the next appropriate steps in helping the child, from increased monitoring of the child at home and removing access to means, to taking the child to an emergency room or local psychiatric facility for further evaluation. consultation in these situations is recommended for the school psychologist to ensure best practice.  TAG2   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 if risk is not a factor, confidentiality should generally be maintained. because of the potential need to break confidentiality in the therapeutic relationship, it is important at the outset of therapy to review the limits of confidentiality with the child. the law also allows for sharing of information with school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the student (such as members of an iep team). TAG2   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 .  TAG2   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what should a TAG2  TAG2 school psychologist do if a subpoenaed for confidential information about a student QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 if the school psychologist has been subpoenaed it is recommended that consultation with their school administration and district legal counsel be immediately sought. depending on the situation, the school psychologist may or may not need to divulge the confidential information. if the parent/guardian signs authorization for information to be shared/exchanged, this will likely create a situation wherein the school psychologist shares the confidential information. TAG2    TAG2 however, consultation in all situations is recommended. if a school psychologist receives a court order, it is very likely information will need to be shared; here, again, consultation with administration and district legal counsel is recommended.  TAG2   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 where in the education code does it specify that school psychologists can provide emergency counseling QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 “ TAG2 emergency counseling” does not appear in education code. it has long been accepted that a school psychologist can provide counseling in an emergency. the psychologist should provide the student with information about what cannot be kept confidential and ensure that the student has given assent. if a student is only seen once, is not deemed at-risk, and services are not going to continue, the student may be seen as a one-time event without prior parental consent. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is a student who is obtaining a bachelor’s or graduate degree able to observe groups and individual counseling sessions with students or would it be a breach of confidentially QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 students may be allowed to observe sessions, but casp recommends parental consent and a letter of agreement be sought between the student, the student’s professor, and the school psychologist conducting the sessions outlining the student’s role as an observer and delineating the extent of the observations. TAG2     TAG2  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is there information or guidance regarding educationally related mental health services (ermhs) assessment to evaluate for residential placement QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 federal and state rules require that a private, non-sectarian school placement is available in the continuum of options for special education students. a comprehensive assessment should document why such a restrictive placement is necessary for the student to benefit educationally from the pupil’s educational program pursuant to an iep. the iep team determines the least restrictive environment to meet the student’s needs.  TAG2   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is it necessary or legally required to develop an assessment plan when adding psychological services to an iep for a student who already receives services QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 any time that a student demonstrates a need in a given area, the iep team should identify the need, develop a measurable goal related to the need, and offer service to allow the student to make progress in the area of need. the law requires that a student be assessed in any area of suspected disability. if staff are considering adding a service to an iep, best practice is to conduct an assessment in the particular area; thus, an assessment plan should be developed and provided to the parent for consent. however, if the parent of the student will not consent to assessment, where the need is apparent, the lack of assessment information by and of itself does not necessarily mean that that the iep team cannot offer services. generally speaking, it is always best to conduct assessments, before offering services, as assessments provide critical information that assists in determining which services are appropriate.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 does counseling really help QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 for most students, counseling does help students make the most of the university experience, both personally and academically. meeting with a counselor is a chance to explore one's hopes and fears, and determine possible courses of action or resolution in a calm, objective and confidential setting. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 will i need to take medication QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 being seen for psychotherapy by a counselor does not necessarily mean you will need to take medications. many psychological problems can be successfully treated without the use of medications. if you and your counselor decide that medications should be considered as a adjunct to counseling, your counselor will discuss referral options with you. you will need to see a physician (such as a psychiatrist) to be prescribed any medications. it is important to let your counselor know about any medications you have already been prescribed. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 does it mean something is terribly wrong with me if i need counseling QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 no. sometimes students at a university find life difficult or overwhelming. a great many life stressors contribute to these feelings. some examples are academic stress, scheduling and time management, illness or injury, and devastating life events such as abuse, death, or a relationship breakup. there can also be factors inside a person that impact their well-being, such as self-esteem, body image or feeling different or isolated from other people because of some aspect of identity or personality. almost everyone experiences some times in life when ordinary or extraordinary events become overwhelming. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 do my parents have to know i am in counseling QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 no. federal and state law prohibits us from acknowledging that you are a client or disclosing any file information with your parent without your specific written permission. an exception to this is for minor students under age 18. although these individuals are generally afforded the same confidentiality protection as an adult student, there are some limitations that a counselor will be happy to discuss with you. we do require that persons under age 18 have written parental (or guardian) consent to receive our services. TAG1  TAG1 it often happens, however, that our clients find it very helpful for their counselors to speak with a parent, a residential life staff member, or a faculty member. it is up to you and your counselor to discuss what would work best in your particular situation. if you have any questions or concerns about confidentiality, feel free to bring them up with a counselor.

TAG1  TAG1 sessions are typically scheduled every 2-3 weeks, although this will vary throughout the semester based on demand for services and availability.  the desire or need for long-term, weekly psychotherapy is usually best addressed through referral to an off-campus provider. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2     how does the counseling center make staffing and service delivery decisions to manage increased demands for mental health support QUESTION      TAG2 click to open TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 in recent years, the demand for mental health services on college and university campuses has risen dramatically. data shows that from 2009-10 to 2014-15, counseling center utilization grew five times faster than institutional enrollment growth [center for collegiate mental health, 2015 annual report]. TAG1  TAG1 in light of the increased demand for campus mental health services, many institutions have invested additional resources in campus counseling centers, including hiring additional clinical and professional staff. despite new investments in additional staff, student distress levels, wait times, and overall demand continue to rise. increasingly, institutions recognize that hiring more staff is not the answer. there is a growing recognition that fundamental change is necessary to meet demand on campus. TAG1  TAG1 the rising demand for services and increasing complexity of students’ mental health concerns has prompted difficult questions about the scope of campus care. institutions increasingly recognize that they cannot provide all types of services to all students with finite resources. this realization is prompting difficult questions about the mission and goals of campus mental health services. as campus leaders and administrators determine what to prioritize, they are often weighing two values: accessibility and intensity. while these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, the reality is that most institutions do not have the resources to effectively provide both. thus, some institutions are emphasizing accessibility by prioritizing quick access for all students. in this model, clinical resources are used to help the greatest number of students solve short-term challenges on campus. students with ongoing or complex mental health needs that require more intensive resources are referred off-campus for support. other institutions are emphasizing intensity by prioritizing ongoing treatment for high-need students, or students with ongoing or intensive mental health needs. here, clinical resources are devoted to a small group of students on campus and there is little to no reliance on community resources to provide care. this approach can result in reduced access or longer wait times for new or non-critical student cases [2018 eab global- establishing a sustainable scope of practice]. TAG1  TAG1 the fredonia counseling center currently prioritizes accessibility to ensure that the greatest number of students can receive assistance as timely as possible.  in the fall 2019 semester, 12.5% of the student population engaged in services.  the average wait time for an initial appointment was 3.45 business days with half of first time visits being initiated via same-day walk-in services.  we regularly review and adjusts our scope of practice and scheduling procedures to address the changing demands of our campus community. our current staffing is consistent with comparable universities at a staff to student ratio of 1:1,000 -1:1,500   [aucccd].  for spring 2019, the fredonia counseling center has a clinical capacity to provide 135 hours of direct-service clinical appointments (individual therapy, crisis, walk-in, group therapy) per week when the center is fully staffed (5.4 clinical providers).   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","FAQ"

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 i’m afraid to be totally honest about how much i’m struggling right now, because i don’t want my therapist to send me home. i’ve heard about students who are sent home by caps even when they want to stay in school. is that true QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if you are concerned a caps therapist may &quot;force&quot; you on a medical leave if you are totally honest about your struggles, it will be important for you to read the  TAG2 medical leave section of this website TAG2 . in the vast majority of cases, students who go on medical leave make a conscious and willing decision to do so, often after conversing with their caps therapist and/or their class dean. in these cases, the students come to realize that their emotional struggles are preventing them from functioning at a minimally acceptable level here at wesleyan, and it is best for them to take time off to fully focus on treatment and resolve their emotional concerns before returning to school. it is extremely unusual for a student to be &quot;forced&quot; to take a medical leave. on these rare occasions, the caps therapist has determined that the student presents an imminent risk of harm and is not currently demonstrating adequate judgment to make the best decision for him or herself.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 i’m pretty sure i have add. can i get stimulant medication from the caps aprn QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 that depends. as you know, stimulant medications have strong potential for abuse. for that reason, we are very careful about dispensing prescriptions for these medications. if you are already on a stimulant for add and you provide us with copies of cognitive and/or neuropsychological testing supporting this treatment, we will be happy to take care of your refills while you are at wesleyan. if you are not currently taking this kind of medication but suspect you may benefit from it, we will need you to complete a neuropsychological evaluation in order to determine whether you in fact have attention deficit disorder. at this time, caps is able to conduct a partial neuropsychological assessment battery for students with no testing history who suspect they may have attention and concentration problems, or other learning issues.  if you are interested in learning more, please contact dr. d'andrea at  TAG2 jdandrea@wesleyan.edu TAG2  to schedule a consultation.

TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 what is psychotherapy QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 psychotherapy is often called “counseling” or “therapy.” psychotherapy is a process of addressing mental health and personal growth issues by talking them through in a private, confidential setting with a trained professional. the process involves weekly meetings to allow for the development of trust and comfort in the relationship between you and your therapist. this exploration in a supportive environment is a process that can lead to greater understanding and self-awareness. it can facilitate maturation and growth as well as help one develop the skills necessary to deal successfully with personal problems and life challenges. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 what would a session at caps look like QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 sessions at caps are 45-50 minutes in length. at first, the meetings are usually focused on information gathering. your therapist will ask questions about the concerns which brought you in and about your life in general in order to get to know you and have a better understanding of your needs. one of the important goals of these meetings is to determine the right kind of treatment for you. TAG1  TAG1 subsequent sessions may take different shapes or forms but, for the most part, your therapist will encourage you to talk freely about your thoughts, feelings, and whatever is troubling you. as sessions progress, you should feel more comfortable with your therapist and you may focus on many different subjects or themes. don't worry if you find it hard to open up about your feelings. your therapist can help you gain more comfort as time goes on. it is important you are open with your therapist and share with him/her your experience of your work together.  both you and your therapist are in this together and communication and collaboration will be important for its success.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 when should i go to caps QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 we all go through stressful situations and tough times in our lives. this is especially true during our college years, when we face new challenges and many changes. reaching out to someone at caps will help you get the support you need to grow personally and thrive in college. asking for help is a sign of strength and maturity; it is not a sign of weakness. TAG1  TAG1 we encourage you to come to caps before your personal struggle becomes overwhelming. some students wait until they are in a panic or reach a breaking point before seeking help, which can result in undue hardship and pain. you might want to consider seeking professional help when things in your personal life are not feeling quite right or when you are in distress and don’t know how to handle it. many students engage in psychotherapy to learn more about themselves to be better equipped to manage life’s challenges.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 why do i have to attend a consultation appointment before starting psychotherapy at caps QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2                 caps offers a range of different services to help students in need. some students have needs that require long-term or specialized services in the community. the consultation appointment is the time for you and a therapist to determine the best way to address your needs.             TAG2  TAG1 what is the difference between therapy and consultation QUESTION   TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 therapy is a process that involves regular meetings with a professional so that trust and intimacy can develop. consultation is often a single encounter with a professional that is aimed at clarifying a discrete issue or problem and identifying some ways to cope or respond. your first encounter with a therapist, whether for a routine or urgent visit will be a consultation. additionally, therapists provide consultation to faculty, staff and concerned family members. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 will i get psychotherapy at caps or be referred to a therapist off-campus QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 when you begin the process of seeking professional help, it’s not easy to know where to start. we encourage students to use caps as the first step in figuring out what type of help is needed. your first encounter with a caps therapist will help determine the right path, whether at caps or with a provider in the community. TAG1  TAG1 caps provides short-term psychotherapy. in cases when there is a desire or need for longer-term or specialized care, caps staff will help students connect with the right resources in the community. these might include long-term psychotherapy, psychiatric care, psychological testing and evaluations, or intensive specialized care for eating disorders or substance abuse. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 what if i want to find my own therapist in the community QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 caps can help you find a therapist in the community but if you want to do this yourself here are a few tips and suggestions: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 find out what your insurance benefits are.  it would be helpful for you to know what your mental/behavioral health outpatient benefits are.  find out if you have a deductible and if there is a co-payment (out of pocket cost) for the services.  please note that for those students using the cmu aetna health insurance, therapy sessions are covered in full with no co-payment. TAG2  TAG2 find out who your insurance covers. there are many times when you can access your insurance website for a list of providers in the area.  if this is not readily available online you can also call them and ask them to fax/tell you a list of providers in your area. TAG2  TAG2 narrow down your search. once you have a list of therapists to choose from consider the following questions: do i have a gender preference QUESTION  what area/location works better for me QUESTION   some therapists list areas of specializations, if that is the case, think what areas would be helpful to you.

TAG2  TAG2 meeting your therapist. we encourage you to approach the first encounter with openness and honesty, while also recognizing that you are trying to find a therapist who feels like a good fit for you.  notice how you feel when you talk to the person, get a sense of what it feels like when you are with them, and attend to your level of comfort or discomfort with them. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  the apa  TAG2 psychologist locator TAG2  and the  TAG2 psychology today website TAG2  can also help you find a provider in your area.  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 what is the cost of services QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 all services at caps are free. if students are interested in continuing psychotherapy beyond our short-term model, or if they are in need of specialized or more intensive treatment, we can help them find services in the community that would fit their needs. these services in the community are usually paid for through the student’s health insurance. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 can i be seen right away if i walk in to caps QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 we offer same day urgent appointments to support students in distress. students can walk-in or call caps to be screened for a same day urgent consultation. at the time of the meeting, a therapist will evaluate your personal situation and formulate a plan with you on what is the best next step to take. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 what does brief therapy look like QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2                 caps offers students short-term psychotherapy. most students come for 6-8 sessions, but the number of sessions you will receive will be determined by you and your therapist. if you desire or need long term care we can help you identify appropriate therapists and mental health professionals in the community. there are no limits for consultation, crisis support, referral and case management services.             TAG2  TAG1 if i reach the limits of the short-term psychotherapy at caps, can i pay to continue working with my therapist QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2                 no. caps is not able to accept private pay nor insurance. as students near the end of their sessions at caps, therapists will discuss recommendations for ongoing care and will help facilitate any referrals to providers in the community when appropriate.             TAG2  TAG1 how much time will i have to wait before i can start therapy QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2                 any student with urgent concerns can be seen as soon as is necessary to ensure they are supported and safe. all students are seen within five business days for an initial consultation appointment. the wait to then start psychotherapy will depend on the student’s availability as well as that of the therapist. for this reason there is some variation in how long it might take to start psychotherapy. often it can be within a few days of the initial consultation.             TAG2  TAG1 who is the staff at caps QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 caps clinical staff consists of nine full-time psychotherapists and four tcc clinicians. as an advanced training facility, caps has several therapists-in-training on staff as well. these are psychology doctoral students and psychiatric residents with prior experience in therapy and supervision. you can be confident that your therapist has the appropriate knowledge and experience to help you address your struggles. if you have any questions or feel you need to see a senior therapist, please call us (412-268-2922) and let us know of your concern. while the clinicians and therapists on staff at caps represent a variety of disciplines and styles, we all share a passion for working with college students and a vested interest in their well-being and personal growth. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 given the many different places to go for support at cmu, how do i know if caps is the right place for me QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2                 there are many useful campus support services available to students, including uhs, academic development, office of disability resources, just to name a few. we can help you determine what is right for you over the phone as well as during an initial consultation appointment. students are often referred to us from other support services, too, so if you go there and it seems like caps might be a good place to go to, they can steer you in this direction as well. sometimes some combination of services and supports is best.  TAG2 see a list of available campus resources. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 i have heard of the groups offered by caps but i don’t know if they are for me.  how are groups helpful QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 one of the reasons group work is so beneficial is that it provides the opportunity to learn and grow through interaction with others in a supportive, safe, and confidential setting. groups also help by connecting students with others who share similar concerns, allowing them to experience acceptance and belonging, give and receive support, and reduce isolation.  TAG1  TAG1 group therapy helps group members experience new ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. a main focus in group therapy is your process of relating to other group members. this work can involve group members developing trust, building intimacy, or working through conflicts together. as group therapists facilitate a safe and confidential environment, group members are able to give support, offer feedback, help raise awareness of interpersonal patterns, and help address difficulties. like other forms of therapy, what you get out of your group experience will depend largely on what you invest into it.   TAG1  TAG1 it may seem scary to think about discussing personal stuff with your peers. if you’re feeling hesitant—and many people do up front—that’s not necessarily a reason to not pursue group work. in fact, that may be a clue that group could be helpful to you, indicating that you could benefit from practicing your relationship skills and increasing your willingness and comfort in sharing your experiences (including your struggles) with others.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 i am looking for housing accommodations based on my mental health diagnosis and needs.  what do i do next QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 housing accommodations are processed through the  TAG2 office of disability resources (odr) TAG2 .  please visit odr's website to download the  TAG2 application form TAG2  and learn the procedure to request housing accommodation.  caps consults with odr, as needed, to provide clarification or provide additional information about the diagnosed condition.  TAG1  TAG1 please contact caps if you are wanting additional support around your diagnosed condition or if you need help finding treatment. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 i am looking for academic accommodations based on my mental health diagnosis and needs.  what do i do next QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 if you received academic accommodations at your previous educational institution (i.e., extended time for testing, quiet testing area, etc.) or your provider feels that you need them now, you could be eligible for such accommodations at cmu at an undergraduate or graduate school level.  caps partners with the  TAG2 office of disability resources (odr)  TAG2 to facilitate the process and help you with the proper documentation.  the office of disability resources requires a licensed medical or mental health provider to provide current documentation that includes diagnosis, an explanation of how your disability impacts your academic performance or campus life, and recommended accommodations. this documentation can be provided directly to the  TAG2 office of disability resources  TAG2 or a caps clinician can help you in the process. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 i am a new cmu student with mental health needs.  how can you help QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 caps can help you get connected to the appropriate care and services in the pittsburgh area and within cmu.  we recommend you schedule a  TAG2 consultation TAG2  session for us to learn more about your needs and preferences with the purpose of making the appropriate recommendations, which may include services at caps, campus support services, or local community providers.  our clinicians try to provide recommendations and referrals that are tailored to individual preferences and/or current circumstances (e.g. insurance coverage, gender, cultural or spiritual background, specific specialties or approaches of the provider). TAG1  TAG1 caps also offers phone consultations to those students who are not local and would like to have information and resources before arriving to the area.  during this phone consultation, you are welcome to have someone else (e.g. parent, guarding, sibling, etc.)  from home participate in the conversation. TAG1  TAG1 if you are not wanting to schedule a consultation session, caps can help you obtain general referrals based on your insurance without a consultation. while it won’t be as tailored, we can still help you get started. if you have any challenges getting appointments or finding a good fit, you are always welcome to call back for more help. TAG1  TAG1 if you would like to find your own therapist in the pittsburgh area, please check our faq  TAG2 “what if i want to find my own therapist in the community QUESTION ” TAG2   you can also follow the same guidelines to find a psychiatrist but, be aware, there are not many psychiatrist listed, so consulting with caps may be your best option for psychiatric referrals.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 i think i might have adhd.  what do i do QUESTION  TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 some of the same symptoms of adhd such as distractibility, difficulty sustaining concentration, etc. are common symptoms of other conditions (depression, anxiety, trauma, significantly increased stress, adjustment to new demands/changes, significant sleep disruption, underlying medical conditions, side effects to medications, etc.). therefore, it is important to obtain a thorough evaluation to determine whether the problems are specific to an adhd diagnosis because treatment could be quite different based on the origin of the problem. TAG1  TAG1 the first step is to schedule the evaluation, called a “neuropsychological evaluation.” the neuropsychological evaluation will help determine the diagnosis and the treatment options (i.e., therapy, medication, academic accommodations, etc.).  while these evaluations are not available at caps, we can help you find a community provider that accepts your insurance and could provide this.  feel free to call caps to schedule a consultation and talk to us about your concerns and how to get started.

TAG2  your current physician will likely give you a 30-day supply before coming to school, but it takes some time to get in to see a psychiatrist (sometimes 6-8 weeks). therefore, it is important to plan ahead and schedule an appointment with a pittsburgh physician prior to finishing up with your current provider. if you are close to running out, our recommendation is for you to contact your most recent provider and ask for a new script to get you through until you see your next doctor. TAG1  TAG1 o  TAG2 extensive documentation of diagnostic evaluation and treatment records are usually required in order to continue prescriptions for stimulant medication.

TAG1  TAG2 subpoenas/case notes TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 what do i do if i receive a subpoena for my testimony or case notes QUESTION  TAG2 this is a common part of being a school counselor. remember, most courts are not looking to attack educators and operate under the general thought that you are attempting to do what is best for students and families. let your principal know, and ask for assistance to contact your district legal team to get advice on how to proceed. if possible, work with the district legal team to get the subpoena quashed. if you are not able to do this, then you are compelled to testify. when giving a testimony, provide only facts and omit any subjective information that may make room for doubt. a few states give students privileged communication, which means they can render the school counselor incapable of testifying about their communications. check your state statutes. in most of cases, the courts are entitled to your testimony, and even in the states awarding privilege communication to minors, judges can often exercise discretion if they need the information for the safety and health of the minor.  TAG2 what is best practice regarding case notes QUESTION  how do i know if my personal notes meet the criteria for case notes QUESTION  TAG2 parents/guardians have a federal right to see anything you write down or record that refers to their child so, as a general rule of thumb, keep your notes in a way you would be comfortable with a parent reading. personal notes should really be more like memory-joggers for you professionally. anything that refers to a student, even using initials, id numbers or personal descriptors, if specific enough, is an educational record that belongs primarily to the parent/guardian. other student names can be omitted, but the parents/guardians have a right to see the rest. you can keep personal notes if you feel the need to be more specific, but the law has been clear that if anyone knows the notes exist they are then covered under the family education and privacy act (ferpa). according to ferpa, case notes are “sole-possession records” and not educational records if they meet specific criteria. they must: serve as a memory aid, not be accessible or shared in verbal or written form, be a private note created solely by the individual possessing it and include only observations and professional opinions.  TAG2 i have taken a job in another district. what do i do with my personal case notes QUESTION  what notes should i keep QUESTION  TAG2 personal notes, as in those notes only you are aware of, are kept for the purpose of supporting the student through long-term knowledge of a student’s experience. if you are comfortable with your school counseling replacement, you may choose to leave the notes with the new school counselor. case notes can always be purged except when there is knowledge that a subpoena is likely or the notes may be needed to help the courts convict a perpetrator such as in the case of child sexual abuse. exercise judgment as to when notes need to remain and when they can be purged. if in doubt, consult.  TAG1  TAG2 confidentiality TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 when do i share information about students with parents or families and with administrators or other school staff QUESTION  TAG2 sharing information with parents/guardians is important when a student’s safety is in question. this may be sexual behaviors, self-harm, drug use or threats to self or others. ultimately, open communication with parents/guardians is important and will help with overall programming in the school.notify administrators of any threats to self or others and when a human services report has been made or the police have been called. if you do not already have a protocol in place for this situation, check with a few neighboring districts for their protocols and bring them to administration for approval. sharing information with the remainder of your team, such other school counselors, psychologists or social workers, is helpful for consultation but also provides additional eyes on students in case you are out of the building when a student needs assistance. this is particularly important regarding social/emotional interventions. otherwise, a sharing of general information when you are concerned about a student – such as a student who has been struggling with a loss or depression -- can be helpful so teachers can notify you of changing behavior in class or with peers. typically, just asking teachers to notify you if they see any behaviors from the student that are different from the student’s normal behavior is enough. TAG2 what do i do if my administrator asks for the names of the students i see and the reasons i’m working with them QUESTION  TAG2 your administrator may be curious about who is seeing you and for what reasons. prepare that information in a general way, using descriptors such as “academic,”“career” or “social/emotional” or in another way where personal information is de-identified. if the administrator wants to know more specifics, this is a good time to process your legal and ethical pull between ferpa’s “legitimate educational interest” and your ethical obligation to protect the information. if the information is relevant to building safety or school programming, it is important to share that with administration. however, remind administration the information is sensitive and that it must be kept confidential to preserve the student’s dignity and rights, as well as your relationship with the students. TAG2 my central office supervisor wants me to provide copies of the action plans we create for students who express suicidal ideation. is that breaking confidentiality QUESTION  TAG2 because of the health and safety concerns, districts have the right to require school counselors to follow policy regarding providing copies of action plans for suicidal students. the confidentiality breach comes when these plans are indiscriminately kept without regard to when they should be purged, where they should be kept and if they are necessary beyond just the district’s need to ward off liability. the action plan is an educational record, but the plan should be kept outside the actual folder for certain eyes only and purged at the appropriate time. TAG2 what do i do if a student tells me she thinks she is pregnant QUESTION  TAG2 it is important to know your state laws around this topic (i.e., what is the age of consent, issues around pregnancy decision-making, etc.) as well as your school board policies regarding the issue and community norms. find out how or if the student has confirmed her pregnancy. other issues to consider include whether the sex was consensual and the age difference of both parties. understanding the student’s relationship with her parents/guardians will provide insights for how you might advise the student to tell her parents/guardians.  TAG2 what do i do if a student tells me he was inappropriately touched by an adult several years earlier or by another student more recently QUESTION  TAG2 if the student tells you he was inappropriately touched, follow your school district’s protocol regardless of the amount of time that has passed. you still have a duty to report. remember that child offenders often offend many times before they are actually caught. you may be preventing future offenses. also, remember that if the adult is anyone but a family member living in the home, you should call the police department. if the student was touched by another student, you will go through a title ix protocol. contact your administration and local police department to investigate; your district may have an identified title ix officer at the district level who can assist. in the case of young children, you may need to call child protective services. a principal recently lost her job when three 5 year olds were caught simulating sex acts on each other, and the principal called the parents and not child protective services. do not ever question if the student is being honest. it isn’t a school counselor’s job to investigate, only to report and support the student. TAG2 my principal and central office supervisor want to know the names of all the students i report to child protective services for possible abuse or neglect. am i required to tell them QUESTION  TAG2 school counselors are mandated reporters, and good-faith reporting is assumed when a professional reports child abuse. the term good-faith reporting refers to the assumption that the reporter, to the best of his or her knowledge, had reason to believe the child in question was being subjected to abuse or neglect. a mere suspicion of abuse is all that is necessary when reporting child abuse. the school counselor is acting legally and ethically when reporting and does not require anyone’s permission to report child abuse. following district or administration policy regarding notifying after the fact the students for whom you called in child abuse is legal and ethical.  TAG2 do i need to provide notification to parents and families when a student is involved in a small group i lead QUESTION  TAG2 school counselors want to build, not erode, credibility and maintain a strong working relationship with parents/guardians. this mission is forwarded when school counselors inform parents their child is to be a group member, as some parents/guardians may view small-group counseling as moving away from classroom instruction to a social/emotional focus; therefore, you should inform parents/guardians. this notification gives you a chance to explain the connection small groups have to academic success, and it gives parents/guardians a chance to opt out. TAG2 my school and district have an electronic management system and want me to include the names of the students i see and the reasons i am working with them. does that break confidentiality QUESTION  TAG2 it is in your best interest to maintain these records as well. and, if you keep the reasons vague enough, you are still protecting student confidentiality while also informing parents/guardians, teachers and/or administrators that the student is accessing you for support. it’s also a reminder to administrators of the need for your position. the asca ethical standards for school counselors state: section a.2n. advocate with appropriate school officials for acceptable encryption standards to be utilized for stored data and currently acceptable algorithms to be utilized for data in transit. avoid using software programs without the technological capabilities to protect student information based upon currently acceptable security standards and the law.  TAG1  TAG2 working with administrators and other staff TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 on several student ieps, the special education director has noted that weekly counseling be provided. this prevents me from fully implementing a comprehensive program. what do i do QUESTION  TAG2 it can be difficult to curtail the process of writing school counselors into ieps. explain that the teacher or the inclusive classroom can better handle interventions targeting social skills and anger management due to the constant need to reinforce or extinguish behavior in the authentic context of the classroom where the behaviors occur. you can support regular education and special education students in brief group counseling or behavior management programs, but a long-term approach that interferes with the student’s education is an inappropriate use of school counselors’ time.iep teams need leadership, communication and clarity regarding the appropriate use of ieps. the team leader should ensure every team member understands that the school counselor’s role must be realistic and relevant as defined by asca. school counselors serve all students in their charge; it is unethical and professionally questionable when others define school counselors’ role as acting outside their scope of practice and serving a small percentage of their population to the exclusion of hundreds of other students in their caseload.  TAG2 the educators in my state are planning to strike. am i required to participate QUESTION  would my participation be considered student abandonment QUESTION  TAG2 you are not required to do anything that isn’t federal, state or county law, district or school policy, or mandated by your supervisor. this means you are not required to participate in any strikes unless you feel compelled to do so. as for student abandonment, if you believe the safety and wellbeing of your students will suffer in your absence, that may be something to consider. consider the length of the absence, whether the family provide appropriate support in your absence and other resources that may be available to students if you chose to strike.  TAG1  TAG2 student harmful behavior TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 my district recently purchased a software package that sends alerts to the school and district when students engage in potentially harmful behavior online. as the school counselor, i’m expected to follow up with all the students for whom alerts were received. this is taking all my time. what do i do and what are the liabilities QUESTION  TAG2 those who favor this type of software argue that it can save lives. however, if schools choose to use this type of software, it’s important to bypass the school and send alerts directly to the parents, guardians or family members if a student’s online activity yields red flags. this direct line of communication should also convey to parents the reason the software generated concern and possible referral resources.some school districts use parts of the software to limit access to particular websites but don’t activate the alerts. however, if schools use the alert functionality, it’s likely school counselors will be assigned to follow up on the alerts. if the software developers continue to put educators into the loop instead of going straight to parents/guardians with alerts, the school district and its designees could face unneeded and unwarranted liability. in a hypothetical example, a student makes a suicide attempt saturday night, but 24 hours earlier at 11 p.m. on a friday night, when the school counselor wasn’t working, the student’s online activity indicated suicidal ideation. the student’s online activity was not detected because the school district used the software to block certain sites but opted out of the self-harm alerts. or, the school district did accept alerts, but the alert came in when the school counselor wasn’t working. could this create liability QUESTION  possibly. the argument is weak that liability would follow because a school district’s actions or lack of action would have to be the actual cause of the death, but do school districts really want to test the argument QUESTION   TAG2 a student at my school sent me an email indicating another student is expressing suicidal thoughts. what are my obligations QUESTION  TAG2 suicide reporting does not hinge on certainty of harm or your discretion. waiting until you have certainty is dangerous. the only knowledge you need to meaningfully act is an expressed, implied, veiled, peer-reported or rumored suicidal ideation. the consequence of the risk – death of a child – is too great. we must err of the side of caution.school counselors should never rely on a student’s denial of suicide intent. students who are bent on self-harm will escape our scrutiny by telling us what they think we want to hear. if something prompted you to question a student about suicide, then you should talk to the parents/guardians as well. in-school suicide assessments are dangerous if relied on for conclusive answers. if a school district performs suicide assessments, these assessments should only be used to alert parents/guardians to the need to monitor their child’s safety and to get them professional mental health care to evaluate and, if necessary, treat the suicide risk. the standard of care for school counselors when informally assessing students who are identified as a potential suicide risk is to employ these assessments with extreme caution, with a follow-up assessment completed by a mental health professional who has been trained to assess the risk. school counselors who rely on an in-school suicide assessment for definitive answers are not only negligent but reckless in their evaluation.  TAG2 a student told me she cuts herself. do i need to tell her parents QUESTION  TAG2 self-harm can feel like a tricky situation because research is unclear of the intent or impact. ultimately, cutting is a form of self-harm, and best practice and the asca ethical standards for school counselors advise school counselors to inform parents/guardians so they have the opportunity to intervene. this helps ensure the student’s overall safety and can help the student get additional help outside of school. TAG2 what do i do if a student tells me she has heard another student brought a firearm to school QUESTION  TAG2 as a school employee, your obligation is to the safety of all students. inform administration and the school resource officer or police, and allow them to move forward from there.  TAG1  TAG2 dual relationships TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 i live in a small, rural community and have my lpc and run a private practice after school hours. does it create a dual relationship if i see current or previous students in my private practice QUESTION  TAG2 the asca ethical standards for school counselors state: ensure there is not a conflict of interest in providing referral resources. school counselors do not refer or accept a referral to counsel a student from their school if they also work in a private counseling practice. TAG2 my son will be a student at my school next year. what do i need to do to avoid a dual relationship QUESTION  TAG2 if a dual relationship is unavoidable, the school counselor is responsible for taking action to eliminate or reduce the potential for harm to the student through use of safeguards, which might include informed consent, consultation, supervision and documentation. the best way to minimize any negative impact is to assign the family member to a different school counselor. if the school counselor is the only one in the building, then the school counselor must work to ensure there isn’t even an appearance of gaining any unfair advantages for the school counselor’s son. TAG2 my principal has asked me to teach a class and assign grades to the students. is that permitted QUESTION  does that create a dual relationship QUESTION  TAG2 sadly, this isn’t uncommon. your administrator is legally your supervisor and determines your role. however, be careful of going down this road and setting precedence. remind your administrator that teaching a class puts students at risk as you will need to prioritize any crisis or suicidal ideation over the class you’re teaching, which could leave your classroom students unsupervised and potentially unsafe. additionally, being responsible for assigning grades to students leads to a dual relationship and should be avoided to minimize potential harm to students.  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","FAQ"

TAG1  TAG1 five signs of emotional suffering TAG1  TAG1 here are the five signs that may mean someone is in emotional pain and might need help: TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 personality changes TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 you may notice sudden or gradual changes in the way that someone typically behaves. people in this situation may behave in ways that don’t seem to fit their values, or the person may just seem different. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 uncharacteristically angry, anxious, agitated, or moody TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 you may notice the person has more frequent problems controlling their temper and seems irritable or unable to calm down. people in more extreme situations of this kind may be unable to sleep or may explode in anger at a minor problem. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 withdrawal or isolation from other people TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 someone who used to be socially engaged may pull away from family and friends and stop taking part in activities that used to be enjoyable. in more severe cases the person may start failing to make it to work or school. not to be confused with the behavior or someone who is more introverted, this sign is marked by a change in the person’s typical sociability, as when someone pulls away from the social support typically available. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 may neglect self-care and engage in risky behavior TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 you may notice a change in the person’s level of personal care or an act of poor judgment. for instance, someone may let personal hygiene deteriorate, or the person may start abusing alcohol or illicit substances or engaging in other self-destructive behavior that may alienate loved ones. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 overcome with helplessness and overwhelmed by circumstances TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 have you noticed someone who used to be optimistic and now can’t find anything to be hopeful about QUESTION  that person may be suffering from extreme or prolonged grief, or feelings of worthlessness or guilt. people in this situation may say that the world would be better off without them, suggesting suicidal thinking.

TAG1  TAG1 except in emergencies, the option must be left open for the student to accept or refuse counseling. if the student is skeptical or reluctant for whatever reason, simply express your acceptance of those feelings so that your own relationship with the student is not jeopardized. give the student the opportunity to consider other alternatives by suggesting that they might need some time to think it over. if the student emphatically says “no,” then respect that decision, and again leave the situation open for possible reconsideration at a later time. if the student agrees to the referral, the student may call or go to pacs to make an appointment.  TAG2 we must speak directly to the student to schedule an appointment. TAG2  the student’s first contact with pacs will typically be an initial consultation in which the student and counselor meet to make a decision about the type of help needed. initial consultation appointments are usually scheduled within a week of the student’s request to be seen at pacs. students requiring immediate help because of psychological difficulties are seen the same day on an urgent basis. finally, you should follow up with the student at a later date to show your continued interest even if they did not accept your attempted referral. TAG1  TAG1 in emergency situations involving students who are unwilling or unable to seek help on their own, please call 911.  TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2             what about confidentiality QUESTION            TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 it is important for members of the university community to understand that all sessions with mental health professionals at pacs are confidential in nature. information obtained during counseling sessions cannot be released except upon the student’s written request, in circumstances which would result in clear danger to the individual or others, reports of child or elder neglect/abuse, reports of hazing, or as may be required by other laws; pacs adheres very strictly to this policy. TAG1  TAG1 if a faculty or staff member is interested in student’s contact with pacs, information can best be obtained directly from the student. it should be noted that students are not bound by the same promises of confidentiality that professional counselors are obliged to keep.  TAG2 pacs clinicians do not provide notes or have direct contact with faculty or staff regarding specific students; communications about specific students generally take place through the dean of students. TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2             are referrals to other sources of assistance possible QUESTION            TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 sources of assistance for students are not limited to professional counseling. they also may include referral to a physician,  TAG2 unh health &amp; wellness TAG2 , the  TAG2 sexual harassment and rape prevention program (sharpp) TAG2 ,  TAG2 housing &amp; residential life TAG2 , the  TAG2 center for academic resources (cfar) TAG2 , the  TAG2 university advising center TAG2 , their parents, a hall director, or a member of the clergy, etc. for this reason, knowledge of persons, offices, and agencies that can be of service to the student is of primary importance. students become discouraged and frustrated when they feel passed along from office to office without receiving the assistance they need. if you are unsure of the appropriate place to send a student to for specific information or help, call pacs at (603) 862-2090 (relay nh: 1-800-735-2964) for information or consultation about the various sources of help on campus.

TAG1  TAG1 a mental health counselor's specialty typically determines their work environment. for example, someone who specializes in helping children may work in a school. however, these professionals often focus on clinical work in private practices, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and inpatient facilities. TAG1  TAG1 since  TAG2 one in four americans TAG2  struggles with mental health challenges, most individuals enter this interesting, fulfilling profession with a personal story. they may have overcome obstacles, lost loved ones to mental illness, or witnessed the impact on their communities. mental health professionals work with many different types of clients and get to know the people they treat. TAG1  TAG1 the  TAG2 bureau of labor statistics TAG2  (bls) projects a growth rate of about 22% for mental health counselor employment, which is significantly faster than most careers. these professionals earned a median pay of $46,240 in 2019. TAG1  TAG1 becoming a mental health counselor TAG1  TAG1 degree requirements TAG1  TAG1 mental health counselor education requirements vary by state. while some states allow professionals with a bachelor's degree to work in psychology, clinical mental health counseling typically requires a master's degree. since clinical professionals work directly with patients to provide a form of healthcare, they need the specialized education of a graduate degree. TAG1  TAG1 when researching degrees, students should look for accredited programs, specifically those accredited by the  TAG2 council for accreditation of counseling and related educational programs TAG2  (cacrep). its  TAG2 search function TAG2  helps students find the right school. learners can search by institution, location, and accreditation status. many of the accredited programs also offer online options. TAG1  TAG1 the flexibility helps those with undergraduate degrees to earn a master's degree while gaining work experience. however, most of these programs require in-person internships. online learners must check with their school to see where they can complete these requirements. TAG1  TAG1 successful completion of a cacrep-certified graduate program qualifies students to sit for the licensing exam. after passing this exam, graduates can practice as mental health counselors. in some cases, they may pursue doctoral degrees. these terminal degrees are best suited for professionals who want to become health administrators or work in a highly specialized area. TAG1  TAG1 clinical experience requirements TAG1  TAG1 some graduate programs require internship hours for credit before graduation. during these hours, each student works with patients under the supervision of a licensed counselor. at many institutions, this accounts for one of the last credit hours in a curriculum. learners put their knowledge to work while applying theories with actual patients. TAG1  TAG1 online degree candidates who must earn these credits can usually do so locally, even if the school is in another state. each learner should contact an academic advisor to learn what the school accepts as experience. then, students can find a clinic or hospital nearby that offers internships and meets the school's requirements. TAG1  TAG1 every state in the u.s. maintains  TAG2 specific licensing requirements TAG2 . however, licensure in any area calls for clinical experience. an internship may count toward this requirement, but many states want all the hours to take place in postgraduate work. generally, each candidate must complete up to 3,000 supervised clinical hours. TAG1  TAG1 these hours must usually include frequent one-on-one patient contact. other hours may include time leading group counseling, meeting with supervisors and peers, and reviewing notes. TAG1  TAG1 candidates often complete these hours in two years or less, ideally in the facilities where they plan to practice professionally. many of these internships offer pay, although unlicensed candidates usually will not earn a full mental health counselor salary. TAG1  TAG1 licensure and certification requirements TAG1  TAG1 to legally practice as a mental health counselor, a professional must first earn a license from the state. most jurisdictions require an applicant to possess at least a master's degree from a cacrep-accredited program. TAG1  TAG1 the program must cover mental health counseling, not school counseling or counseling education. after graduation, many states require candidates to complete supervised clinical hours. applicants must also pass one or more exams. the test requirements usually include a passing score on the national clinical mental health counseling examination developed by the national board of certified counselors (nbcc).

TAG1  TAG1 a licensed mental health counselor holds a minimum of a master's degree in counseling or another closely related field in mental health care. after obtaining a master's degree, mental health counselors complete two to three years (depending on various state statutes) of clinical work under the supervision of a licensed or certified mental health professional. the qualifications for licensure are similar to those for marriage and family therapists and for clinical social workers. TAG2  TAG2 [7] TAG2  TAG2  becoming a counselor and using it in daily life to help others to learn more about themselves is not a reason for someone to pursue a degree within this field. ethics within this profession require the counselor to remain professional to be able to adequately treat patients. remaining detached as the witness to a client's thought, feelings, and emotions can be a hard thing to do, but will ultimately reassure a patient that there are no judgement to what they will share. TAG2  TAG2 [8] TAG2  TAG2  guiding a patient to understand themselves and their choices is also another aspect of this profession. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","NOT"

TAG1  TAG1 clinical mental health counseling is important to total patient care TAG1  TAG1 what is clinical mental health counseling QUESTION  it’s helping people from all walks of life solve the problems they face, according to u.s. news &amp; world report TAG2 . TAG2  applying their real-life experience and professional training, clinical mental health counselors coordinate with psychiatrists, social workers, support groups and long-term treatment services to devise and implement total care strategies, notes u.s. news &amp; world report. TAG1  TAG1 u.s. news &amp; world report explains that at the heart of what clinical mental health counselors do is diagnosing mental and emotional disorders. they evaluate their clients’ mental and physical states, identify addictions and behavioral problems, and determine how ready their clients are for treatment. after developing treatment strategies and presenting them to clients and their families, counselors help clients gain skills and learn behaviors that put them on the path to mental wellness. TAG1  TAG1 tackling the epidemic of addiction TAG1  TAG1 often the problems clinical mental health counselors help their clients address involve substance abuse and behavioral disorders. also called addiction counselors, these health professionals advise clients on managing stress and handling the problems they encounter on the road to recovery. according to the bureau of labor statistics (bls), addiction counselors work with clients in private sessions and in group settings, often including concepts pioneered by alcoholics anonymous and other 12-step programs. TAG1  TAG1 mental health counselors’ goals are to help clients rebuild their self-esteem, re-establish personal relationships and restore professional careers. specialties within the category of addiction counseling include crisis intervention, when the client’s life or the lives or others are at risk, and work with at-risk populations, such as teenagers, veterans and people dealing with physical disabilities. TAG1  TAG1 family and marriage counseling TAG1  TAG1 few tasks in the mental health field are more challenging than fulfilling the role of a marriage and family counselor. the work entails placing oneself in the middle of families whose members have suffered or are suffering an emotional or mental crisis, according to u.s. news &amp; world report. family and marriage counselors deal on a daily basis with clients who have experienced abuse, infidelity, grief and other traumas; their patients may be recovering from depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. TAG1  TAG1 the goal of family and marriage counseling is to allow clients to discuss what they have experienced and express their emotions and to assist clients as they adjust to difficult family situations, such as divorce or financial setbacks. according to bls, family counselors’ main focus is helping clients process their reactions and develop strategies for coping with change and overcoming difficulties in their lives. TAG1  TAG1 diagnosing and treating mental illness TAG1  TAG1 diagnosing most physical illnesses is relatively straightforward and often involves the results of medical tests and studies. diagnosing mental illnesses, however, often requires patience because the process may entail a period of monitoring and testing to ensure the condition isn’t related to an underlying medical condition. these medical tests may need to be performed over a period of time to ensure an accurate result. TAG1  TAG1 when diagnosing a mental illness, health professionals often rely on the american psychiatric association’s diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-5). the manual lists feelings, symptoms, behaviors and other criteria that patients must meet for clinicians to make an official mental illness diagnosis, according to the national alliance on mental illness (nami). once the provider has made a diagnosis, the patient’s mental health team can develop a treatment plan and advise the patient on the results and risks involved with the plan. TAG1  TAG1 addressing the mental health needs of the elderly TAG1  TAG1 a growing trend in the mental health field is the number of older people seeking treatment for depression and emotional problems, reports the new york times. often the condition is the result of a physical malady associated with old age, such as limited mobility, but just as often older clients are motivated to seek treatment for mental conditions they have struggled with for much of their lives. TAG1  TAG1 mental health professionals who specialize in treating older patients credit the diminished stigma associated with being treated for emotional problems and mental illness for the boost in seniors welcoming treatment. the nami reports that the number of people in the u.s. over the age of 65 who suffer from depression exceeds 6.5 million. adjusting to new living arrangements, managing on limited incomes and coping with chronic physical maladies all contribute to the growing mental health crisis among the elderly. TAG1  TAG1 helping people conquer the stress monster TAG1  TAG1 as psychologist melanie greenberg wrote in her psychology today column, a little bit of stress can make people more resilient, but too much stress can cause trauma from which it’s difficult to recover. the american psychological association’s stress in america survey found that finances and work are two significant sources of stress. these kinds of significant stressors can cause physiological overreaction: the release of hormones that speed up the heart, increase breathing rates and promote blood flow. the long-term effect of an overactive stress response is an impaired immune system and heightened risk of physical and mental illness. TAG1  TAG1 one of the most effective tools in the clinical mental health counselor’s arsenal for battling stress and other maladies of modern life is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is designed to change unhelpful habitual responses and reinforce positive behaviors, as notes the manpower demonstration research corporation (mdrc). in addition to identifying and addressing the direct causes of excessive stress, cognitive behavioral therapy encourages patients to strengthen their relationships with family members and friends, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, avoid drugs and alcohol, and, most importantly, accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. what clinical mental health counselors do is put all the cognitive therapy pieces together in a clear regimen that’s easy for the client to follow. TAG1  TAG1 learn more TAG1  TAG1 this is an exciting time to be a part of the mental health profession. the need for clinical mental health counselors has never been greater, and the combination of early outreach and reduced stigma is improving mental health treatment results substantially. discover the many ways wake forest university’s  TAG2 online master’s in counseling and human services TAG2  can serve as the foundation for a career as a clinical mental health counselor.

TAG1  TAG1 counseling is a process of varying lengths during which a mental health counselor and a client work together to explore problems and develop the skills and mindset needed to transcend challenges and live a life of  TAG2 emotional health TAG2 . the length of the counseling process varies depending on the individual and the mental health disorder or distress. it can continue anywhere from a few weekly sessions to months or, sometimes, years of occasional sessions. TAG1  TAG1 people seek counseling for many different things. counseling is for mental illness as well as for specific life stresses, such as a toxic workplace with a bullying boss. counseling happens individually, in one-on-one sessions with a counselor. additionally, people can engage in couples therapy, family therapy, or group therapy. TAG1  TAG1 clinical mental health counseling approaches TAG1  TAG1 mental health counselors choose from a plethora of approaches when helping someone. the particular approach used depends on both the counselor's professional preference as well as the nature and characteristics of an individual client. TAG1  TAG1 each approach has a particular focus. mental health counseling methods can emphasize a person's background, emotions, thoughts, behaviors, or a combination of these elements. within each category are specific theoretical techniques. below is a list of the most common approaches, or theories. the list is meant as a starting point for exploration. if there are some methods that resonate with you, you can inquire about the theoretical approach when you are searching for a counselor. TAG1  TAG1 theories that emphasize background are: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 psychoanalysis (freud and the couch) TAG2  TAG2 jungian analytical psychology TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 among theories that focus on thoughts are: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 cognitive therapy TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 acceptance and commitment therapy (act) TAG2  TAG2 solution-focused brief therapy TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a growing counseling approach that falls into the categories of thoughts, feelings, and behavior as well as stands strongly on its own is positive psychology. TAG1  TAG1 most counselors don't practice one single approach but instead weave together principles of many to best fit individual clients. approaches most likely to be used on their own include cbt, dbt, act, and solution-focused brief therapy.

TAG1  TAG1 you might ask therapists you're considering if they use a particular type of therapy and how it works. you may get more out of therapy if you understand how the process usually works and how the therapist thinks it will help you. some therapists will blend a few different approaches together to suit your particular needs. TAG1  TAG1 the following are a few common types of therapy: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt)  TAG2 has two main aspects. the cognitive part works to develop helpful beliefs about your life. the behavioral side helps you learn to take healthier actions. cbt often works well for depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder, but it can also be used for other various conditions. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 interpersonal therapy TAG2  focuses largely on improving relationships and helping a person express emotions in healthy ways. this approach often works well for depression. a variation of it called &quot;interpersonal and social rhythm therapy&quot; often works well for bipolar disorder because it also helps develop a daily schedule that supports recovery. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 family therapy TAG2  helps family members communicate, handle conflicts and solve problems better. forms of family therapy often are used for treating eating disorders and bipolar disorder. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 psychodynamic therapy TAG2  helps people develop a better understanding about their unconscious emotions and motivations that can affect their thoughts and actions. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 art therapy TAG2  can include using music, dance, drawing and other art forms to help express emotions and promote healing. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 psychoeducation TAG2  helps people understand mental health conditions and ways to promote recovery. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 for more information on types of therapy visit the national institute of mental health website at  TAG2 http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies/index.shtml TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 in addition to different types of therapy, each therapist has different amounts and types of training. for example, a psychiatrist is trained in therapy but also has a medical degree and can prescribe medication. a pastoral counselor will include a religious or spiritual approach to treatment. other therapists may be trained to deal with substance use issues. TAG1  TAG1 what to expect TAG1  TAG1 depending on your situation, therapy can be fairly short or longer-term. often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes. your first session will be different from future visits. the initial visit is more of a &quot;getting to know you&quot; session and will help your therapist get an idea of how to proceed with your treatment. TAG1  TAG1 you have a right to feel safe and respected in therapy.  if you're concerned, you can ask about confidentiality. usually, though, it's understood that a therapist respects your privacy; and that group members do too, if you're meeting in a group. therapy should address your needs, goals, concerns and desires. if you're going to be talking to someone about your most personal thoughts, you want to feel comfortable.  TAG1  TAG1 you can think about what traits might make you feel more comfortable with a therapist. for example, would you prefer to see: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 a man or woman TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","NOT"

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 this lesson explores areas dealing with patients, mental health settings, and preventative measures that counselors can take when doing mental health counseling. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 mental health counseling TAG1  TAG1 your brain consists of 1-2 billion neurons (billion with a 'b'), each with 5-10,000 connections. that makes your brain, which weighs 2-4 pounds, massively interconnected. in fact, these are just estimates because trying to count these individual cells in your brain is really difficult. with all of these neurons and connections working together, the convergent result is you. your personality, your thoughts, your memories, and experiences are all stored in that gooey thing between your ears.  TAG1  TAG1 with this in mind, it is not difficult to see how something could get wired wrong, leading to a problem. thankfully, there are several groups of people that can help fix the issue, ranging from those who only focus on the neurons to those who focus on preventative measures. one of these groups is focused on both using preventative measures and correcting the issue; that is to say, they are keeping the wires from crossing in the first place and trying to untangle them once they do. this is known as  TAG2 mental health counseling TAG2 , defined as an individual performing therapy with a client that combines traditional psychotherapy and problem solving with the intent of changing the problem or issue.  TAG1  TAG1 one question that seems to pop up a lot is, 'what's the difference between groups who do therapy and groups who do counseling QUESTION ' there are more similarities than differences between the two. many people attempt to split them along different lines, but the main difference between the two has to do with the level of severity and their overall purpose.  TAG1  TAG1 counseling focuses on natural stresses and issues with life, like grief, depression, and needing someone to talk to. that doesn't mean counselors cannot deal with more difficult issues, but that tends to be the domain of psychologists. psychologists tend to conduct therapy that focuses on severe psychological issues, like schizophrenia, personality disorders, and serious mental illnesses.  TAG1  TAG1 mental health counseling can be broken down into a couple of different aspects. we will be looking at the primary areas mental health counselors deal with: mental disorders, preventative measures, and who the clients are.  TAG1  TAG1 mental disorders and diagnosis TAG1  TAG1 when neurons in your brain get crossed up, they tend to do it in a measurable way. everyone has bad days where they don't want to do something. that is normal and means your brain's wiring is fine and normal. i can already hear people grumbling about 'there is no such thing as normal.'  TAG1  TAG1 yes, there is. it is normal to get up and go to work. it is normal to want to do something you think is fun on the weekend. problems, or major deviations from the norm, are indicative of wiring problems as well as bad information in the wires.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 mental disorders TAG2  are recorded behavioral and cognitive conditions marked by stress or difficulty functioning. these are issues that have been taken to the next level. as an example, you may not want to get out of bed. someone with a mental disorder physically cannot will themselves out of bed even if they have festering sores and are wasting away. people suffering from this level of depression likely have problems with their thoughts as well as problems in the wiring of their brain.  TAG1  TAG1 mental disorders are often defined by the  TAG2  TAG2 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders TAG2  TAG2 , usually shortened to  TAG2 dsm TAG2 , which provides the requirements, statistical features, research, and terms for various mental disorders. this is where we find the names and criteria of mental disorders.  TAG1  TAG1 when it comes to mental health diagnoses, there is a serious problem of people mixing up a person having a diagnosis into making a person into a diagnosis. what i mean is that it is not uncommon to hear, 'that schizophrenic.' this is like calling someone with aids, 'that aids,' which we would never do. it is a person  TAG2 with TAG2  schizophrenia and a person  TAG2 with TAG2  aids, not a person who  TAG2 is TAG2  schizophrenia or aids.  TAG1  TAG1 prevention TAG1  TAG1 some disorders are wired into the brain before birth, making prevention difficult. mental health counselors use preventative measures to make sure problems don't get bigger than they need to be. the old saying 'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure' is the name of the game. prevention of mental disorders is broken down into three areas: primary, secondary, and tertiary.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 primary prevention TAG2  is defined as activities taken to prevent the onset of a targeted condition. these are the things a counselor may do to prevent a condition from occurring before there is even a hint of an issue. this might be stress relieving breaks at an office, which lead to a reduction in the levels of anxiety and depression in the office and will lead to fewer cases of mental disorders.  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 secondary prevention TAG2  is defined as activities focused on preventing an asymptomatic condition. here there are the hints of a problem, but if it is caught early, it will be kept from growing into a full-blown problem. an example of this would be administering reading, writing, and math tests in schools to identify children who may have problems in these areas, and then taking those children who exhibited problems and putting them into groups to help them. this is where you target the issue, like reading, and get to the problem before it gets bigger.

TAG1  TAG1 problems helped by psychotherapy include difficulties in coping with daily life; the impact of trauma, medical illness or loss, like the death of a loved one; and specific mental disorders, like depression or anxiety. there are several different types of psychotherapy and some types may work better with certain problems or issues. psychotherapy may be used in combination with medication or other therapies. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 therapy sessions TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 therapy may be conducted in an individual, family, couple, or group setting, and can help both children and adults. sessions are typically held once a week for about 30 to 50. both patient and therapist need to be actively involved in psychotherapy. the trust and relationship between a person and his/her therapist is essential to working together effectively and benefiting from psychotherapy. TAG1  TAG1 psychotherapy can be short-term (a few sessions), dealing with immediate issues, or long-term (months or years), dealing with longstanding and complex issues. the goals of treatment and arrangements for how often and how long to meet are planned jointly by the patient and therapist. TAG1  TAG1 confidentiality is a basic requirement of psychotherapy. also, although patients share personal feelings and thoughts, intimate physical contact with a therapist is never appropriate, acceptable, or useful. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 psychotherapy and medication TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 psychotherapy is often used in combination with medication to treat mental health conditions. in some circumstances medication may be clearly useful and in others psychotherapy may be the best option. for many people combined medication and psychotherapy treatment is better than either alone. healthy lifestyle improvements, such as good nutrition, regular exercise and adequate sleep, can be important in supporting recovery and overall wellness. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 does psychotherapy work QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 research shows that most people who receive psychotherapy experience symptom relief and are better able to function in their lives. about 75 percent of people who enter psychotherapy show some benefit from it.  TAG2  TAG2 1 TAG2  TAG2  psychotherapy has been shown to improve emotions and behaviors and to be linked with positive changes in the brain and body. the benefits also include fewer sick days, less disability, fewer medical problems, and increased work satisfaction. TAG1  TAG1 with the use of brain imaging techniques researchers have been able to see changes in the brain after a person has undergone psychotherapy. numerous studies have identified brain changes in people with mental illness (including depression, panic disorder, ptsd and other conditions) as a result of undergoing psychotherapy. in most cases the brain changes resulting from psychotherapy were similar to changes resulting from medication.  TAG2  TAG2 2 TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 to help get the most out of psychotherapy, approach the therapy as a collaborative effort, be open and honest, and follow your agreed upon plan for treatment. follow through with any assignments between sessions, such as writing in a journal or practicing what you’ve talked about. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 types of psychotherapy TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 psychiatrists and other mental health professionals use several types of therapy. the choice of therapy type depends on the patient’s particular illness and circumstances and his/her preference. therapists may combine elements from different approaches to best meet the needs of the person receiving treatment. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) TAG2  helps people identify and change thinking and behavior patterns that are harmful or ineffective, replacing them with more accurate thoughts and functional behaviors. it can help a person focus on current problems and how to solve them. it often involves practicing new skills in the “real world.” TAG1  TAG1 cbt can be helpful in treating a variety of disorders, including depression, anxiety, trauma related disorders, and eating disorders. for example, cbt can help a person with depression recognize and change negative thought patterns or behaviors that are contributing to the depression. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 interpersonal therapy (ipt) TAG2  is a short-term form of treatment. it helps patients understand underlying interpersonal issues that are troublesome, like unresolved grief, changes in social or work roles, conflicts with significant others, and problems relating to others. it can help people learn healthy ways to express emotions and ways to improve communication and how they relate to others. it is most often used to treat depression. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 dialectical behavior therapy TAG2  is a specific type of cbt that helps regulate emotions. it is often used to treat people with chronic suicidal thoughts and people with borderline personality disorder, eating disorders and ptsd. it teaches new skills to help people take personal responsibility to change unhealthy or disruptive behavior. it involves both individual and group therapy. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 psychodynamic therapy TAG2  is based on the idea that behavior and mental well-being are influenced by childhood experiences and inappropriate repetitive thoughts or feelings that are unconscious (outside of the person’s awareness). a person works with the therapist to improve self-awareness and to change old patterns so he/she can more fully take charge of his/her life. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 psychoanalysis TAG2  is a more intensive form of psychodynamic therapy. sessions are typically conducted three or more times a week. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 supportive therapy TAG2  uses guidance and encouragement to help patients develop their own resources. it helps build self-esteem, reduce anxiety, strengthen coping mechanisms, and improve social and community functioning. supportive psychotherapy helps patients deal with issues related to their mental health conditions which in turn affect the rest of their lives. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 additional therapies TAG2  sometimes used in combination with psychotherapy include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 animal-assisted therapy – working with dogs, horses or other animals to bring comfort, help with communication and help cope with trauma TAG2  TAG2 creative arts therapy – use of art, dance, drama, music and poetry therapies TAG2  TAG2 play therapy – to help children identify and talk about their emotions and feelings TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 more information TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  january 2019 TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 finding and choosing a psychotherapist TAG1  TAG1 psychotherapy can be provided by a number of different types of professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed social workers, licensed professional counselors, licensed marriage and family therapists, psychiatric nurses, and others with specialized training in psychotherapy. psychiatrists are also trained in medicine and are able to prescribe medications. TAG1  TAG1 finding a psychiatrist or other therapist with whom an individual can work well is important. sources of referrals include primary care physicians, local psychiatric societies, medical schools, community health centers, workplace employee assistance programs (eap), and online resources (see links to online locators below). TAG1  TAG1 federal law requires that in most cases mental health services, including psychotherapy, be covered by health insurance similar to other medical care costs.

TAG1  TAG1 to help meet the demand for effective counseling, many professionals consider pursuing a graduate education to refine abilities, learn new competencies and advance their careers. however, for some, the question of “what type of psychology career is right for me QUESTION ” can be a challenge. so many career choices with a psychology degree exist, and students usually decide based on their personal and professional interests. TAG1  TAG1 however, learning about all the possible counseling career options can help students identify the best choice. in doing such research, two major types of counseling emerge: mental health counseling and family and marriage counseling. it’s important to learn the distinctions, because there are subspecialties within these larger groups. in either case, an  TAG2 online master of arts in counseling TAG2  from bradley university helps students develop nuanced skills and gain from a dynamic learning environment. TAG1  TAG1 what are the differences QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 while there is overlap between mental health counseling and family and marriage counseling, key differences exist. the american counseling association (aca) describes individual counseling — which is relatable to the scope of mental health counseling — as “a personal opportunity to receive support and experience growth during challenging times in life … [helping clients] deal with many personal topics in life such as anger, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, marriage and relationship challenges, parenting problems, school difficulties, career changes, etc.” TAG1  TAG1 the aca further explains marriage counseling, sometimes called couples counseling, as helping clients resolve conflict, reach understandings, and reestablish realistic expectations and goals. family counseling, the aca says, can take various forms (mixing group and individual counseling), while common topics include “concerns around parenting, sibling conflict, loss of family members, new members entering the family, dealing with a major move or a general change affecting the family system.” TAG1  TAG1 parsing the differences between the two is somewhat difficult, but mental health counseling can be broadly understood as helping clients address mental health needs — whether related to a condition or not — and providing therapeutic relief and advice. family and marriage counseling can incorporate some of the same elements of mental health counseling, like issues brought on by stress, grief and addiction. the key distinction is that this method of counseling addresses those issues within the context of the family unit or a marriage, as well as how it affects members of those groups and what remedies families can employ. TAG1  TAG1 mental health counseling career options TAG1  TAG1 mental health counselors help clients cope with behavioral complications, emotional needs and/or psychological problems. counselors in this area employ many techniques and interventions to aid clients in understanding their feelings or developing ways to self-regulate. professionals with focused skills and knowledge are needed to serve the wide population of clients, which leads to counseling career options including: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 individual counseling TAG2 : as the aca explains, individual counseling helps clients deal with personal issues and how they affect the individual, as well as their relationships with other people. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 substance abuse counseling TAG2 : these counselors specialize in providing support for clients who suffer from substance abuse, helping them deal with addiction. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 rehabilitation counseling TAG2 : professionals in rehabilitation work with clients who have a disability or experience life-altering events to help them lead positive, productive lives. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 crisis counseling TAG2 : crises can provoke intense and complex needs for counseling, and counselors in this specialty help clients recover from traumas. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 veterans counseling TAG2 : members of the armed services can struggle with adapting to civilian life, or have mental health needs related to experiences in combat, all of which these counselors are uniquely prepared to help them address. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 given the wide variety of career choices with a psychology degree, mental health counselors are often employed in diverse settings, both public and private, and in practice or in academia/research. counselors may be found in independent practices, health systems, government agencies, corporations, substance abuse facilities and nonprofits, among other settings. TAG1  TAG1 completing a master’s degree can help professionals advance, earning a higher counseling and mental health services salary. the u.s. bureau of labor statistics (bls) found the median annual wage for mental health counselors was around $43,000, above the average for all occupations, and could range higher depending on where counselors are employed. those in the government, for instance, averaged $50,000 in salary. TAG1  TAG1 family and marriage counseling career options TAG1  TAG1 as noted, family and marriage counselors can encounter many of the same issues as mental health counselors (grief, crisis, substance abuse, depression), but primarily address client needs through the lens of the family or a marriage. additionally, while family and marriage counselors may see clients in an individual setting, the bulk of family therapy casework is conducted through group sessions. this calls for different skills and strategies on the counselor’s part to facilitate self-expression, mediate discussion, resolve conflict, heal wounds and achieve positive outcomes for the family or couple. TAG1  TAG1 family and marriage counselors, similar to mental health counselors, can be found in a variety of employment settings. counselors in social services agencies often need to address family cases in their workload, while marriage counselors can find jobs in hospitals as well as businesses. family and marriage counselors earn a bit more than mental health counselors on average, about $47,000 according to bls data. and the market for their services is rapidly expanding. government figures predict a 23 percent increase in family and marriage counselor jobs between 2016 and 2026, above the 16 percent clip seen across all occupations. TAG1  TAG1 earn your online degree from bradley TAG1  TAG1 counselors interested in a career in either path should consider earning their master’s from bradley. the online master of arts in counseling program is designed to provide a high-quality learning experience that features a robust curricula, world-class faculty, experiential learning opportunities, ambitious learning outcomes and a chance to grow both personally and professionally. the clinical mental health counseling track of the  TAG2 online mac program TAG2  can help students focus their studies on mental health counseling or family and marriage counseling.

TAG1  TAG1 below, find answers to some of your most frequently asked questions about cosmetic surgery and aesthetic procedures. remember that your physician is best able to answer questions and elaborate based on his or her evaluation of your needs. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is the difference between cosmetic and reconstructive surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cosmetic surgery is performed to reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve appearance and self-esteem. cosmetic surgery is usually not covered by health insurance because it is elective. TAG1  TAG1 reconstructive surgery is performed on abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors or disease. in general, reconstructive surgery is performed to improve function, but may also be completed to approximate a normal appearance. TAG1  TAG1 reconstructive surgery is typically covered by most health insurance policies, although coverage for specific procedures and levels of coverage may vary greatly. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is the recovery from cosmetic surgery like QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 each patient tolerates pain after surgery in different ways. your surgeon will prescribe the appropriate pain medications to help minimize any discomfort. in general, most facial cosmetic operations have minimal discomfort post-operatively. liposuction is slightly more uncomfortable, and operations that require elevation or tightening of the muscles-such as an abdominoplasty or breast augmentation can cause discomfort equal to a c-section. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 where will my procedure be performed QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 most elective surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis, but if emergency hospitalization becomes necessary, you want to be sure that you can be admitted quickly for appropriate care. TAG1  TAG1 one way to gauge the overall quality of the center is to determine whether it is certified by the  TAG2 joint commission on accreditation in healthcare organizations TAG2  (jcaho), which accredits nearly 16,000 healthcare organizations and programs in the united states – everything from hospitals to outpatient surgery facilities. other accrediting organizations include the  TAG2 american association for accreditation of ambulatory surgery facilities TAG2  and the  TAG2 accreditation association for ambulatory health care TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what should you know about the safety of outpatient surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 it's important to learn about the safety of a plastic surgery procedure, as well as the expected outcome. although thousands of people have plastic surgery every year without complications, no surgical procedure is risk-free. TAG1  TAG1 to maximize your safety, ensure the following: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 your physician is certified by the american board of plastic surgery (abps) or other appropriate medical board. to verify a surgeon's certification status, contact either the  TAG2 american board of plastic surgery TAG2  or  TAG2 american board of medical specialties TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 your physician has hospital privileges. some surgical procedures can solely be performed in an ambulatory surgical facility. however, it is important to find out if the physician has operating privileges. regardless of where the surgery is performed, the surgeon should have privileges to perform the procedure in an acute care hospital. TAG2  TAG2 the surgical facility uses skilled, licensed personnel to administer and monitor your anesthesia and your recovery immediately following the procedure. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 what does restylane TAG2 ® TAG2  do QUESTION  how is it different from botox TAG2 ® TAG2  QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 restylane TAG2 ® TAG2  is very effective in smoothing out and filling in bothersome wrinkles and lines, particularly in the lower part of the face. it has several advantages over other filler-type materials such as collagen; it lasts longer and causes very little adverse reaction. it is easy to administer (injected through a small needle), and once its effectiveness has diminished six months to a year later, the body safely absorbs it. TAG1  TAG1 restylane TAG2 ® TAG2  and botox TAG2 ® TAG2  (botulinum toxin) often are used in a complementary fashion. while restylane TAG2 ® TAG2  is best for the lower face, botox TAG2 ® TAG2  is great for wrinkles that occur in the upper face – crow's feet or the vertical frown lines between the eyebrows – because it paralyzes muscle and nerve endings, stopping the skin from wrinkling. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 if i have botox TAG2 ® TAG2  or restylane TAG2 ® TAG2 , how often would i need to repeat the injections QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 botox TAG2 ® TAG2  lasts about three to four months, and the treatment can be repeated as needed. when it wears off, you will begin to notice increased muscle action and some reformation of the wrinkles. it appears that with repeated use, the effect of botox TAG2 ® TAG2  becomes longer lasting. TAG1  TAG1 restylane TAG2 ® TAG2  injections last for about six months, and can also be repeated as needed. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i know what size breast implant is right for me QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the decision is based on a number of factors, including the patient's desires, reasons for the surgery and overall health. TAG1  TAG1 for example, are you doing it because you feel your breasts are too small relative to your body contour or are you unhappy with the size and firmness of your breasts following pregnancy, breastfeeding or major weight loss QUESTION  unevenness between the breasts can also be a motivating factor. your surgeon can help you make the right decision during your pre-surgical appointment(s). TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 does a person's voice change after rhinoplasty (nose surgery) QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a few patients notice small change in their voice after rhinoplasty but this is uncommon. professionals who rely on their voice, such as singers, should share any concerns with their surgeon, however, because the nose does play a role in how we sound. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what type of mini face lift can be done to raise cheekbones QUESTION  what is the recovery time QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the available options can only be discussed after having an evaluation with a plastic surgeon. in general, recovery time from a mini face lift is approximately two weeks. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how is a patient's physical condition evaluated prior to plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 a complete pretesting series of appointments is done prior to any surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do you perform tumescent liposuction QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 yes, tumescent liposuction, a technique that results in less bruising, less swelling and a quicker recovery than older traditional methods of liposuction, is routinely performed at cleveland clinic cosmetic &amp; plastic surgery center. TAG1  TAG1 tumescent liposuction uses a large volume of dilute epinephrine to cause intense constriction of the small blood vessels, which leads to less bleeding, less bruising and less swelling. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what are the possible risks QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there are risks associated with any surgical procedures. find out what they are, how often they occur and how they will be handled if they do occur. if the doctor does not openly discuss the risks or admit that there are always risks, seek another opinion. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 are financing options available QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 as a rule, cosmetic plastic surgery is considered “elective surgery” and is not covered by most insurance plans. if the service is not covered by insurance, cleveland clinic may provide some financing options. please call 216.444.4004 and ask to speak to one of our financial representatives who can explain payment options, including  TAG2 carecredit TAG2  TAG2  financing. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is there anything to do to minimize swelling or bruising QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 yes. depending upon what the procedure, it might make sense to sleep in a reclining (not horizontal) position for one week following surgery to minimize the collection of fluids in the face and eyelids. TAG1  TAG1 follow the instructions you will be given about making and administering your cold and warm compresses. these will not only reduce bruising and swelling, but they will also maximize and promote healing.

TAG1  TAG1 it’s only natural for you to have questions about plastic surgery. although it is always a good idea to discuss your concerns with your surgeon, you can find answers to some frequently asked questions below. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 plastic surgery is a type of surgery used to mold and reshape the structures of the body. plastic surgery can be used to help you meet your ideal appearance goals and improve self-esteem, or it can be performed to restore normal function and appearance. in some cases, plastic surgery may be elective. in other cases, it may be a medical necessity. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what are the types of plastic surgery QUESTION   TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there are two types of plastic surgery: cosmetic and reconstructive. TAG1  TAG1 cosmetic surgery is used to enhance and improve the appearance of normal body structures without impaired function. this type of plastic surgery is elective and not a medical necessity. when considering cosmetic surgery, make sure that you are doing it for yourself and not to meet someone else’s expectations. a breast lift to improve the appearance of your breasts is one example of cosmetic surgery. TAG1  TAG1 reconstructive surgery is used to restore function to body structures that have been damaged due to congenital deformity, developmental abnormalities, or trauma. reconstructive surgery may also incorporate some aspects of cosmetic surgery to restore normal appearance. burn rehabilitation or a breast reconstruction after surgical treatment for cancer are examples of reconstructive surgery.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much does plastic surgery cost QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 when setting the price for a plastic surgery procedure, three main factors are considered. first, part of the cost is used to pay your plastic surgeon. second, there is the cost of the facility in which the operation takes place. finally, the cost of the anesthesia is taken into account. TAG1  TAG1 the final cost of plastic surgery may vary depending on a number of other factors as well, such as insurance coverage and medical necessity. cosmetic surgery is typically not covered by insurance plans because it is an elective surgery. reconstructive surgery, however, is usually covered because it is a medical necessity in many cases.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how safe is plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 each year, thousands of cosmetic and reconstructive plastic surgeries are performed without complication. however, no surgery is without risk. part of the risk depends on your health background, how intensive the surgical procedure is, and the type and amount of anesthesia used. your surgeon will review the risks of your procedure with you before helping you decide whether plastic surgery is right for you. TAG1  TAG1 to help ensure patient safety, all upmc pinnacle surgeons are board-certified experts, have the proper privileges to perform plastic surgery, and operate only in accredited facilities that conform to strict safety standards.

TAG1  TAG1 a physician who is certified by the american board of plastic surgery has, after graduation from a 4 year medical school, completed 6 to 8 years of postgraduate surgical training in general surgery or ear, nose, and throat surgery and plastic surgery. in addition, he or she has passed rigorous written and oral examinations in the field of plastic surgery. the american board of plastic surgery is approved by its governing body, the american board of medical specialists. most medical specialty boards are approved by this parent board. but some, like the american board of cosmetic surgery, are not. that is why we feel you should look for a plastic surgeon who is certified by  TAG2 the american board of plastic surgery TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 many physicians in their advertising will call themselves plastic surgeons and claim to be board certified. but be sure to ask  TAG2 which TAG2  board. if you learn that your “plastic surgeon” is certified by the american board of ophthalmology (eyes) or the american board of internal medicine, you may want to keep searching. TAG1  TAG1 how long is the recovery period QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 recovery time from a plastic surgery procedure will vary with both the individual patient and the procedure performed. but we can speak in generalities here. with most cosmetic surgery procedures, time off work can usually be limited to one week. bigger procedures such as a tummy tuck could require an extra week at home. and of course, the type of work you do will dictate how soon you resume it. a person with a desk job involving no heavy lifting can certainly return to work sooner than someone with a more physically demanding job. many of my patients are hair stylists, and their return to work is delayed, as they tend to stand most of the day at work and are constantly raising their arms. other patients of mine with more physically demanding jobs include construction workers, sales people who stay on the road, and teachers. TAG1  TAG1 the procedure you undergo will dictate your recovery. a facelift patient should not drive until neck turning is easy and not painful. because we use our “ab” muscles while driving to accelerate and brake, a tummy tuck patient should wait at least 2 weeks before driving. TAG1  TAG1 as a general rule, we allow our patients to resume aerobic activity after 3 weeks and weightlifting after 6 weeks. brisk walking in your neighborhood is all that we want you to do in the first 3 weeks of your recovery. and if you are unsure, certainly call our office to ask us questions. and listen to your body – if any activity during the recovery period is causing you pain, you should put that off for a while. TAG1  TAG1 do you take insurance QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 most of the procedures we do here are cosmetic, elective surgeries, and are not covered by insurance. TAG1  TAG1 what if there is a complication with my surgery QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 it is highly unlikely that a complication will occur during surgery. dr. pope performs many of his surgeries at orlando aesthetic institute on par street at i-4. oai is accredited by the american association for accreditation of ambulatory surgery facilities, inc. (aaaasf), considered the gold standard in accreditation, and we regularly have safety training and drills to keep protocols fresh in our minds in the event of an emergency. TAG1  TAG1 am i able to have a procedure done with dr. pope if i live out of town QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 yes, of course. we have many patients who travel from out of town for their surgeries. lisa sanzone, our practice manager and medical assistant, would be happy to help set up you pre-op, and post-op appointments so you are away from home the least possible amount of time. she can even recommend hotels in the area. after confirming that you have a trusted family member or friend to bring you in the morning of surgery, drive you home, and stay with you at least 24 hours after your surgery, we are perfectly comfortable with patients traveling for a procedure. TAG1  TAG1 who will give my anesthesia QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 we understand that general anesthesia makes many patients feel uneasy. you will be taken care of by a board certified anesthesiologist from jlr medical group, the group that staffs the operating rooms at florida hospital. jlr is trusted, experienced and highly capable. TAG1  TAG1 where will i have my surgery QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 dr. pope performs many of his surgeries at orlando aesthetic institute at par street and i-4. TAG1  TAG1 he is also on staff at orlando health and advent health (the two major hospital systems in orlando), as well as same day surgicenter of orlando (sso), a free-standing outpatient surgery center. TAG1  TAG1 can i have more than one procedure done at once QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 yes, depending on the amount of time required for each procedure and the recovery process. it is often easier to have multiple procedures done at once, limiting the need to go under general anesthesia again at a later date. TAG1  TAG1 as an added benefit, a 10% discount on dr. pope’s surgical fee is applied to additional procedures. TAG1  TAG1 what does the surgery quote include QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 your quote will include: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the care of one of central florida’s premier board certified plastic surgeons; TAG2  TAG2 the fee for the surgical facility; TAG2  TAG2 the anesthesiologist; TAG2  TAG2 routine pre- and post-op care for one year; TAG2  TAG2 24/7 access to our staff; TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","FAQ"

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 who performs plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 plastic surgery is performed by surgeons who have spent at minimum six years of residency (post medical school) training in care of patients and performing a wide variety of surgical procedures. some specific surgeries of the head and neck may also be done by oral &amp; maxillofacial or otolaryngology surgeons. surgery of the hand may be done by plastic surgeons, orthopedic or general surgeons. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much will my surgery cost QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 this will vary depending on the surgery that is best for you. for example, a “tummy tuck” cost will be different for different patients depending on the amount of work that is required. in order to give you a realistic quote, your surgeon needs to be able to speak with and examine you to have an understanding of your particular needs.  TAG2 schedule a consultation TAG2  with dr. scott to get started. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do i have to pay for a consultation visit QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 cosmetic consultation visits with hendricks regional health plastic &amp; reconstructive surgery are offered without cost. if you are seeing us for non-cosmetic concerns, the visit fee will be billed to your insurance, just like any other doctor’s appointment. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do you offer financing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 our practice is owned by hendricks regional health and we offer  TAG2 care credit TAG2  as an option to finance cosmetic/non-insurance services. for clients who have other financial questions, our billing department is always willing to work with our patients to help them formulate a plan for payment.  TAG2 visit this page TAG2  for information on hendricks regional health’s financial assistance program. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is cosmetic surgery real surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 despite not being essential for survival or overall physical health, cosmetic surgery procedures are “real” surgeries. most are performed with anesthesia just as are other necessary surgeries and like any surgical procedure do have an associated set of risks. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i choose a plastic surgeon QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 we strongly recommend that you select a plastic surgeon who is board certified by the american board of plastic surgery. this certification indicates that your surgeon has had many intense years of training experience, and has passed a rigorous certification process to earn this title. also, as with any important relationship, it is a good idea to have a surgeon whom you feel comfortable with and who you feel understands you and your goals. it does not mean that you will always agree 100%, but they should listen to you, and be able to offer advice and thoughts for discussion. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i am unhappy with my previous plastic surgery. what can i do QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 if you have a working relationship with your previous plastic surgeon, it may be a good idea to start with a follow up consultation with them—let them know your concerns. if not, most plastic surgeons care for patients who have seen other doctors, and they do perform revision surgery. improvement is not always possible, but it never hurts to get other opinions.  TAG2 schedule a consultation TAG2  with dr. scott to get started. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is the big deal with smoking and having plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 nicotine is the destroyer of good plastic surgery. many patients get tired of hearing “stop smoking” from doctors. for plastic surgery, nicotine cessation is a must—not a suggestion. this is due to the impact of all nicotine products on healing. nicotine compromises blood flow, which can lead to tissue death, wound formation, and failure of your surgery. we do understand that it is hard to stop smoking, and in partnership with your other doctors we will support you as you quit. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much time will i need to be off work after my surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 this will depend on the surgery that you have; however, even for our “big” surgeries most patients are back to work within about two weeks. if you have particular job requirements or restrictions, be sure to go over these details at your consultation visit. we are also always happy to provide documentation to your employer for necessary time away. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 if i have surgery with a plastic surgeon, will i have scars QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 as a plastic surgeon, even in non-cosmetic surgeries my goal is always to have the “nicest” scar possible; however, plastic surgeons do not have any special magic that allows them to perform completely scar-free surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is plastic surgery expensive QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 plastic surgery usually costs less than people think. the range for most cosmetic surgeries in our midwest region is usually from $3000-10,000, and many fall in the middle of that range. clearly this is not “cheap” for many of our patients, but having a cosmetic surgery is not a privilege reserved for the rich and famous. for those whose insurance is paying for their surgery, you will be responsible for your deductible and portion dictated by your particular plan. sometimes, this may mean that the out-of-pocket fee is less than that which your total insurance fee would be. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do i need medical records for my consultation visit QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 it is always helpful and may make your visit better-informed and more efficient if you can provide records and information about prior care related to your primary concern. this is particularly true if you are considering revision or re-do surgery. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1 breast TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is breast reduction surgery covered by insurance QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 breast reduction surgery can frequently be covered by insurance. there are particular criteria that a patient must usually meet in order to qualify, one of which is often time spent working with a physical therapist, chiropractor or medical massage specialist. please contact us if you have particular questions, so that we can guide you on the best course or  TAG2 schedule a consultation TAG2  to see if you are a candidate. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 if i have a problem with my cosmetic breast implants, is surgery to correct it covered by insurance QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 problems related to cosmetic breast implants are not often covered by insurance. they may be covered by your implant warranty. occasionally insurance may pay for surgeries like ruptured implant removal. each case is different, and we can offer you the best advice after having a consultation about your particular situation.  TAG2 schedule a consultation TAG2  with dr. scott to get started. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do i have to have my implants “changed out” QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 breast implants are not meant to last forever. like any artificial device they do “wear out”. modern day implants (post-2006) are typically meant to last for 12-15 years. if your implants are older than this, you may have no problems at all, but your chances of having an implant-related issue do increase. if you have questions or issues, you may need to have imaging of your breasts, like an ultrasound or mri, but this can best be guided by your plastic surgeon. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is breast reconstruction surgery covered by insurance QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 breast reconstruction surgery following mastectomy is covered by insurance. this includes the initial reconstruction, as well as any revisions that may be needed, and even extends to procedures such as tattooing of nipples to finalize your reconstruction. this is true under the women’s health and cancer rights act of 1998. reconstruction procedures following lumpectomy surgery is not required to be covered, but typically is. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do i have to have breast reconstruction QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 no person having breast removal surgery is required to have breast reconstruction. the decision to undergo breast reconstruction is a very personal one and is something that we discuss at length with each patient and their family. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i had a lumpectomy instead of mastectomy, and my breasts are different sizes/indented now; is there anything i can do QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 surgeries to return your breasts closer to symmetry as well as improve dents/divots/deformities are possible. this may include reduction or lift of the opposite breast, augmentation of the smaller breast (placement of an implant), fat grafting to the indented area, or others. these are often covered by insurance plans. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 if i have breast surgery (reduction/augmentation) can i still breastfeed QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 breast reduction surgery is most often done by techniques which still allow breastfeeding. however, milk production may be reduced because less breast gland tissue is present. there are techniques which remove the nipple and thereby remove the ability to breastfeed, but these are less common. it is important to know that not all women, with or without prior breast surgery, will be able to successfully breastfeed. breast augmentation surgery does not typically alter the ability to breastfeed. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do i have to wear a bra after breast surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 after you are fully healed, the choice to wear a bra or not is your own. however, you will likely have more lasting results and reduce the long-term effects of gravity better, with consistent supportive bra wear. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 are breast implants safe QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 breast implants, particularly silicone breast implants, have been rigorously and extensively studied by the fda and many other bodies worldwide. our current scientific knowledge indicates that they do not cause breast cancer, connective tissue or autoimmune disease. however, there can be mechanical and other issues related to breast implants, which should be thoroughly reviewed with your plastic surgeon before having them placed. if you feel that you are having problems related to your implants, consult with a qualified plastic surgeon. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is bia-alcl QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 this stands for breast implant associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. this is a very rare type of lymphoma (blood cancer) which has been recognized for about the last decade. it is not completely understood, but is felt to be associated with breast implants, particularly textured surface silicone breast implants. there have been less than 500 people ever diagnosed with this disease, and it has been very treatable for most by removal of the implants and implant-related capsule (scar). this condition is not “breast cancer” and breast related lymphoma can occur without the presence of implants. symptoms may be change in the scar capsule around the implant and development of a seroma (fluid collection) around the implant long after surgery. there is no current recommendation from any scientific or government body for implants to be removed if patients are not having issues. if you have concerns or symptoms, consult with a board certified plastic surgeon.  TAG2 read more about bia-alcl TAG2  from the american society of plastic surgeons. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i had a friend who said that her breasts regrew after her breast reduction—will this happen to me QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the breast gland tissue that is removed during a breast reduction does not ever regrow. however, your body will still deposit fat within the breasts if you have significant weight gain, and this can cause the breasts to grow in size. with major weight gain, they can even become larger than before surgery. the opposite can also happen with dramatic weight loss. however, if you maintain a fairly steady weight, your breast reduction results should be stable over many years. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1 abdomen TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i’ve lost weight and now have hanging skin. will insurance pay to have it removed QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 this is a tough question. there are very specific requirements that most insurance companies use to determine whether they will pay for abdominal skin removal. the best answer is to consult with a plastic surgeon so that we can give you a more informed opinion.  TAG2 schedule a consultation TAG2  with dr. scott to get started. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can i have a tummy tuck when i deliver my baby/have my c-section QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 most certified plastic surgeons strongly recommend against having a tummy tuck at the time of your delivery. while it may seem convenient to do at the same time, the abdominal tissues stretch with pregnancy, and so you will have the best result if they are allowed to recover and “snap back” as much as possible. typically we recommend waiting at least six months after delivery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long is the recovery from tummy tuck surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 this can be as short as two weeks or as long as eight to ten weeks. it largely depends on what needs to be done to get your particular abdomen looking as good as possible. dr. scott will go over all this in detail and provide you a better estimate at your consultation. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can i have liposuction to lose weight QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 liposuction is not a weight loss procedure. it is used to “sculpt” the fat layers and contours of the body for fine-tuning, not for larger scale change or fat removal. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i’m a man, can i have a tummy tuck QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 definitely! more and more men are having plastic surgery, including tummy tucks. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 do liposuction results last QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 if your weight stays stable, the results of your liposuction or any body contouring procedure should last for many years. with large weight shifts in either direction, they will change. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can i have a baby after a liposuction or tummy tuck surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 having abdominal procedures like liposuction or tummy tuck does not mean that you should not or cannot have future pregnancies. however, with the changes that the body experiences in pregnancy, we do recommend if possible that you hold off on cosmetic abdominal surgeries until you are done in order to maintain your best result, but it is not mandatory. TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1 skin TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i have several moles that bother me, should i see a plastic surgeon or a dermatologist QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 if you have areas of concern, dermatologists are best for skin screening—they are the “skin experts” of the medical world. that said, if you have one or two areas that you know need to be removed, particularly in areas that are cosmetically sensitive (like the face, upper chest, etc.) it may be better to start with a call to your plastic surgeon. if you have doubts or questions, just call us at  TAG2 (317) 718-7980 TAG2  and we can help guide you. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is the difference between a plastic surgeon and a dermatologist QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 plastic surgeons have undergone a wide spectrum of surgical training, both for small and very large procedures. they are trained in surgery performed on all body parts from the top of the head to the sole of the foot and everywhere in-between. dermatologists do not go through the same surgical training process, but are skin-experts in a very wide variety of skin conditions— including things like rashes, acne, skin cancers and many other conditions. dermatologists often perform biopsies or smaller procedures in their offices, but typically refer patients who need larger surgery or procedures in cosmetically sensitive areas to a plastic surgeon. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is botox versus filler—aren’t they the same thing QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 botox and filler are two very different things. botox is a brand name for a drug which is injected into muscle in order to temporarily paralyze the treated area. this is useful in plastic surgery for softening the appearance of age-lines and also for preventing their formation or worsening. filler products are used much like spackle for a wall—they are injected under the skin to take up space where there are depressions or lines. each product can be very useful on its own, or sometimes they work together in combination to help decrease the appearance of skin aging. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long does botox last, and can it become permanent QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 botox and the other drugs in this family are not permanent. their action lasts for about three months when used in cosmetic applications, but they do require repeated treatments to maintain the desired effect. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what can i do to make my scars better QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 scars are a permanent change to the skin. in plastic surgery, we strive to have the “best” scars possible, but there are no truly “scarless” techniques if the skin is cut. strategies to improve the appearance of scars may include scar massage, protection from uv (sun) exposure, use of scar management products like silicone gels/sheets, steroid injection, treatment with lasers and even radiation in rare cases.

TAG1  TAG1 and it's no surprise that liposuction is so popular. liposuction procedures can help boost confidence by eliminating stubborn areas of fat that never seem to go away no matter how much you diet or exercise. TAG1  TAG1 despite its growing popularity, many prospective patients don't know much about the procedure. these are some of the most common questions that patients have about this treatment. TAG1  TAG1 what does liposuction commonly look like QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there are a few different types of liposuction available. each technique has its merits and having an open conversation with a board-certified plastic surgeon will help determine which is right for you. TAG1  TAG1 however, almost all liposuction methods involve safely and carefully infiltrating a solution of saline, epinephrine and lidocaine into the fat prior to aspirating/sucking out the fat. this standard of care applies to just about all liposuction cases. TAG1  TAG1 the more common type of liposuction is power-assisted liposuction, which involves the insertion of a very small, thin tube called a cannula to break apart the fat by vibrating very rapidly. the fat is then suctioned from the body. this is typically a quicker and more precise method of liposuction. TAG1  TAG1 is liposuction surgery safe QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 like all surgical procedures, there are some risks associated with each of the liposuction mentioned above. during your consultation, your surgeon will be able to fully layout any risks for the type of liposuction you choose. TAG1  TAG1 generally speaking, however, liposuction is considered a safe procedure, and if you follow your post-op instructions closely, there are rarely any serious complications. TAG1  TAG1 how do i choose a plastic surgeon for my procedure QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 googling &quot;liposuction near me&quot; or &quot;seattle liposuction&quot; will return a list of liposuction surgeons in your area, but because this is such a personal and important experience, investing time and effort in finding the right surgeon is wise. TAG1  TAG1 at a minimum, you should always seek out plastic surgeons who are board certified by the  TAG2 american board of plastic surgery TAG2  and have met the standards required for membership in the american society of plastic surgeons. meeting these standards means these surgeons have undergone extensive training and passed rigorous testing in order to practice their craft. TAG1  TAG1 choosing a plastic surgeon is also a highly personal decision. it's important for you to feel safe and comfortable and with the surgeon you choose, so don't be afraid to schedule consultations with different doctors to find the right &quot;fit&quot; for you. TAG1  TAG1 another important thing to consider is aesthetics. each surgeon will have his or her own style of body sculpting. be sure to look at  TAG2 before and after galleries TAG2  to gain an understanding of how a surgeon will handle your body shape. TAG1  TAG1 how long will it take to recover QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 recovery varies from one person to the next, but in general, most people can return to desk work and light activities within a week or so after treatment. you may experience swelling and discomfort for a bit longer than this, and you will be advised not to perform any strenuous exercise for at least a month. TAG1  TAG1 it's important to follow all post-op guidelines closely to minimize recovery time and prevent any complications from arising. TAG1  TAG1 will i be in pain after the procedure QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 liposuction is a surgical procedure, so there will be some swelling, pain and discomfort in the first few days of your recovery. most people report feeling post-op pain up to four or five days, but it subsides quickly, and any lingering discomfort can be managed easily. TAG1  TAG1 next steps on your liposuction journey TAG1  TAG1 more and more patients are choosing liposuction to attain the sleek and sexy figure they've always wanted. if you want to know more about liposuction or want to see if it's the right cosmetic procedure for you, schedule a consultation with an  TAG2 asps member surgeon near you TAG2 .

TAG1  TAG1 how long will my results last QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 it is very important to understand that while plastic surgery can turn back the clock in terms of helping you look rested and rejuvenated, it cannot stop the natural aging process. therefore, while you can expect your results to last many years, the gradual loss of skin elasticity and other factors will take their toll. you can prolong the results of your surgery by taking measures to maintain your weight, protect your skin from sun and other damaging entities, and avoiding tobacco use. TAG1  TAG1 will my surgery leave any permanent scars QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 all surgery results in scars, but these scars can be significantly minimized by a skilled surgeon. closed  TAG2 rhinoplasty TAG2  presents no visible scars, while procedures such as  TAG2 breast augmentation TAG2  and  TAG2 abdominoplasty TAG2  will result in some visible scarring. dr. newman uses refined techniques and provides detailed aftercare instructions to ensure that scars fade as much as possible and can be easily concealed. TAG1  TAG1 is plastic surgery safe QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 when performed by  TAG2 an experienced and reputable surgeon TAG2  who takes time to confirm that you are a candidate for the procedure you desire, plastic surgery is quite safe. the most significant measure patients can take in ensuring their own safety is to choose a  TAG2 board-certified TAG2  plastic surgeon providing treatment in an accredited facility.  TAG1  TAG1 when can i resume normal activities QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 it is important to understand that everyone heals at a different rate. in addition to your unique capacity to heal, the length of recovery will depend upon the type and number of procedures you receive. dr. newman will schedule follow-up visits to monitor your recovery, and he will let you know when it is safe to resume work, exercise, and strenuous activity. TAG1  TAG1 how much does plastic surgery cost QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there are many factors that influence the price of a cosmetic procedure, including the extent of your surgery, the venue in which your surgery takes place, and your choice of surgeon. dr. newman has a private and fully accredited surgical suite, which is considerably less costly than performing surgery in a hospital. meanwhile, it is extremely important to budget for precisely the results you want rather than compromising your goals to fit a specific dollar amount. revision surgery is often costlier than initial surgery because it is more difficult to perform. therefore, by trusting your care to an excellent surgeon and undergoing the extent of surgery necessary to make your true goals a reality, you can actually save a significant amount. TAG1  TAG1 does insurance cover cosmetic surgery QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 plastic surgery performed for the sole purpose of aesthetic enhancement is not covered by insurance. however, if there is a practical need for plastic surgery, you may be eligible for some coverage. this often applies to patients who undergo rhinoplasty to correct a deviated septum, those who undergo body contouring to remove excess skin causing rashes and other complications, and women who undergo a breast reduction to relieve strain.  TAG1  TAG1 what are my financing options QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 there are a number of institutions that offer low-interest financing for plastic surgery, often requiring no down payment. our friendly and knowledgeable staff can explain your options in detail so you can find a way to make plastic surgery a comfortable fit for your budget.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 plastic surgery TAG2  is a surgical sub-specialty that deals with healing and restoration of the patient’s natural form and function. this may include improving disfigurement or scarring from trauma, disease, or congenital defects. it also includes cosmetic surgery to correct or rejuvenate facial and bodily features that are displeasing to the patient. all of the principles of cosmetic surgery are derived from reconstructive procedures, and that is why it is important that you go to a board-certified plastic surgeon. a surgeon certified by the american board of plastic surgery has been fully trained in reconstructive surgery as well as cosmetic surgery. because reconstructive surgery is the basis for cosmetic surgery, a surgeon cannot excel in cosmetic surgery procedures such as  TAG2 breast augmentation TAG2  if he has not had training in facial and body reconstruction. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how does a physician become a plastic surgeon QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 training to become a plastic surgeon is a long and arduous task. to become a board-certified plastic surgeon (certified by the american board of plastic surgery), a physician must complete at least 7 years of surgical specialty training after 4 years of medical school. most plastic surgeons complete a 5-year training program in general surgery, although a small number train in ent or orthopedic surgery. following the initial training program in surgery, a 2 or 3-year accredited plastic surgery fellowship is then completed. prior to official certification by the american board of plastic surgery, the physician must pass a rigorous set of both written and oral examinations. while numerous physicians use the term “plastic surgeons” or “cosmetic surgeons” to describe themselves, only those certified by the american board of plastic surgery are true plastic surgeons. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what questions should i ask before choosing a plastic surgeon to make sure that he is qualified QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 bring a checklist of questions to help ensure the safety and quality of your procedure. i recommend asking the following: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 are you certified by the american board of plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if the doctor claims to be “board certified,” ask him which board did the certification. certification by the american board of cosmetic surgery is not the same as certification by the american board of plastic surgery. only the american board of plastic surgery is recognized by the american board of medical specialties, and it is the only board that can certify plastic surgeons! TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 do you have hospital privileges to perform this surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 many procedures can be performed in an office setting but it is important to find out if your doctor has the ability to perform the same procedure in a hospital. before granting operating privileges to a surgeon, the hospital review committee will verify the physician’s credentials and training to evaluate his competency. many “cosmetic surgeons” perform procedures in their offices but cannot obtain hospital privileges because they lack the proper training. should you have a post-operative complication after undergoing a procedure by one of these physicians and should you need hospitalization for correction, your operating physician will not be allowed to provide the necessary care – and you will be stuck trying to find someone to address the issue. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 what are the risks involved with the procedure QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 there are risks with every procedure. ask the surgeon to discuss the risks that are relevant, how often they occur, and how will they be handled if they occur. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 what is the expected recovery time QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 be sure to discuss post-operative restrictions on activity and time periods for returning to work. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 how much will the surgery cost QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance and payment is always expected in advance. costs will include the surgeon’s fee, and fees for the surgical facility (hospital) and anesthesia. other possible costs may include post-operative garments, pre-operative blood work, and medications. should the rare need for a hospital operating room be needed to correct a complication, it may or may not be covered by your insurance. you should contact your insurance company to find out if you are covered for complications related to cosmetic surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will i have a scar after plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 yes! scarring is the result of any incision. part of the reason you should choose a board-certified plastic surgeon is that he has spent years mastering the techniques of wound closure. the technique with which he closes the wound and the proper orientation of the incision should lead to a fine line that will be hardly noticeable. scars mature and fade over time, but you must remember that each person heals differently. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 who is a candidate for plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the best candidates for plastic surgery, either reconstructive or cosmetic, are people with realistic expectations! they must understand the limits of medicine, technology and their own bodies. good candidates have a strong self-image, a definitive goal and a strong reason for pursing a procedure. they are looking to improve a trait, knowing that while it will enhance their self-image, it will not change other peoples’ perception of them. dangerous motivations include undergoing a procedure to gain popularity or to reverse a recent life crisis. TAG1  TAG1 patients should also be healthy. people with significant medical illness will not be good candidates for cosmetic surgery. during your consultation, you will be asked about your medical history as well as medications you may be taking in order to see if you will be able to safely undergo the procedure. your safety is our first and foremost concern!!! TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 am i too old to pursue plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there is no rule with respect to age. as long as your goals are realistic and there are no medical contraindications, you can undergo plastic surgery at any age. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 where is the surgery performed QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 that depends on the procedure and the patient. procedures done on healthy patients under local anesthesia can usually be done in the office. procedures done needing sedation or general anesthesia are best done in a hospital setting and are usually done on an outpatient basis. but…a patient with multiple medical issues may need to have the procedure performed in a hospital setting even if the procedure will be done under local anesthesia. this will be discussed with you during your cosmetic plastic surgery consultation. whether you live in brooklyn or staten island, it is important to choose a board-certified plastic surgeon who has hospital privileges, so that your surgery can be performed in a hospital setting. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much pain is involved in plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 each procedure carries with it some discomfort and will require different levels of anesthesia. in most situations, the type of procedure will dictate the method of anesthesia needed to provide the most comfort to the patient. TAG1  TAG1 after the procedure, you will be given postoperative pain medication to reduce any discomfort you may perceive. every day after the procedure the discomfort becomes less and most people have minimal issues within a few days after the operation.

TAG1  TAG1 facial plastic surgeons are typically double board certified/eligible in both otolaryngology/head &amp; neck surgery and facial plastic &amp; reconstructive surgery. the world’s largest association of facial plastic &amp; reconstructive surgeons is the american academy of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery (aafprs - www.aafprs.org). the academy’s bylaws require fellows to be board certified surgeons with experience and training in facial plastic surgery. TAG1  TAG1 dr. robert hillstrom is board-certified by both the american board of otolaryngology (www.aboto.org) and the american board of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery ( TAG2 www.abfprs.org TAG2 ).

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is the best age to have facial plastic surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the best age for facial plastic surgery varies with each specific procedure and for each individual patient. in general there are no specific age requirements. for example, otoplasty (ear surgery) is often performed on children between the ages of 4 and 14, but adults may also choose to have the surgery and are frequently excellent surgical candidates. facelift, blepharoplasty, and browlift procedures are most often performed on patients over the age of 40. however, if a younger patient has droopy eyelids, or a patient has a family history of premature facial aging, a cosmetic procedure may be indicated at an earlier age. while it is ideal to have a facelift when the first signs of aging begin to appear to achieve optimal results, patients often delay consultation until the distractions of aged appearance become particularly bothersome. TAG1  TAG1 during your consultation, dr. hillstrom or dr. wright will determine which procedure will best accomplish your desired outcome. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what will recovery be like following my facial procedure QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 recovery time varies widely depending on the specific type of cosmetic procedure you choose. the majority of our medical spa treatments have little to no downtime, and patients are able to immediately return to work and their regular routine. our more extensive surgical procedures typically require more recovery time. during your initial consultation, dr. hillstrom or dr. wright will discuss the expected recovery time for the specific treatment or procedure you choose and how it may affect your routine and lifestyle. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 recovery following rhinoplasty TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 after rhinoplasty, a thin plastic cast is placed over the bridge of the nose and left on for three to five days. unlike some other rhinoplasty surgeons, dr. hillstrom and dr. wright do not routinely pack the nose after surgery. this allows the vast majority of our rhinoplasty patients to breathe through their nose postoperatively, creating a significantly more comfortable postoperative period. TAG1  TAG1 rhinoplasty patients at hillstrom facial plastic surgery are typically able to return to their normal routine a short while after surgery. it is recommended that patients sit upright to keep their head elevated for the first day after surgery to minimize any swelling or discomfort that may occur. a small amount of oozing is common after surgery and many patients may experience a dull headache. a small amount of bruising may occur beneath the eyes, but this usually resolves within the first two weeks. sutures placed on both the inside and outside of the nose dissolve on their own and rarely require removal. TAG1  TAG1 the majority of any facial swelling usually improves within the first few days to weeks after surgery. however, a small amount of residual swelling in the nose may persist for many months after surgery, especially at the nasal tip. the improved appearance of the nose by rhinoplasty is permanent and scarring is generally minimal. TAG1  TAG1 to schedule a consultation with dr. hillstrom or dr. wright, or for more information about rhinoplasty, please contact our office. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 will my insurance company cover the cost of facial plastic or reconstructive surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 typically insurance companies do not cover plastic surgery that is performed for purely cosmetic reasons. some insurance policies may partially or fully cover reconstructive surgery procedures that are deemed “medically necessary.” for example, functional rhinoplasty performed to correct a nasal breathing problem is usually covered by insurance. dr. hillstrom and dr. wright can help in clarifying this distinction for you. we will also help you to consult your insurance provider and policy for details on what is and is not covered on your particular plan. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what non-surgical alternatives to facial plastic surgery are available QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 if you would like to restore a healthy, more youthful appearance to your face but are not ready for a surgical procedure, there are a variety of treatments available to you. botox® cosmetic is one of the most effective non-surgical treatments available to reduce the appearance of facial lines and wrinkles. furthermore, volume replacement fillers such as juvéderm™, restylane®, and perlane® can be used to soften and fill in facial folds and wrinkles. these products can also be used to augment the cheeks, giving the appearance of a midface lift. they can fill in the smile lines from the nose to the corner of the mouth as well as the depressions in front of the jowls to give the appearance of a “non-surgical facelift”. the results from wrinkle fillers typically last 6 to 24 months, depending on the anatomic location in which it is placed and the particular filler used. TAG1  TAG1 in our skin care center we offer treatments such as skin resurfacing with microdermabrasion and chemical peels, facials, hydrofacials, intense pulsed light therapy, and medical grade skin care products to give your face a healthy, more youthful appearance. in addition to these facial treatments, hillstrom facial plastic surgery also offers treatments for the body including laser hair removal. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is hyaluronic acid QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 hyaluronic acid is a natural complex sugar found throughout all living organisms that retain water -- absorbing more than 1,000 times its weight -- and adds volume to the skin’s surface. in addition, hyaluronic acid binds with collagen and elastin and transports essential nutrients to these fibers. the triple combination of collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid provides structure, elasticity and volume to the skin and contributes to its overall appearance. TAG1  TAG1 as the skin ages the cells lose the ability to produce hyaluronic acid. as a result the skin loses volume, often resulting in facial wrinkles and folds. dermal fillers made from crossed-linked hyaluronic acid are used by surgeons to restore skin volume and a smooth, natural appearance. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how do perlane and restylane work QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 perlane® is injected into the skin to smooth away wrinkles and folds. perlane®’s water-loving nature attracts and binds water molecules present in the skin to help maintain volume. TAG1  TAG1 perlane® is composed of hyaluronic acid, a natural substance that already exists in the body. the hyaluronic acid in perlane® is a crystal clear gel that is chemically cross-linked (the long chemical strands are tied together) to delay breakdown by natural skin enzymes. perlane® is non-animal-based and contains no animal protein. allergy pre-testing is not necessary. restylane and perlane are minimally cross-linked, making them similar to the natural hyaluronic acid found in the body. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what is the history of hyaluronic acid QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 physicians have been developing ways to restore volume and structure to aging skin using a variety of approaches for over 100 years. past fillers included paraffin, silicone and collagen injections. TAG1  TAG1 in the 1930s, researchers discovered a natural substance in the body that they named hyaluronic acid, and they found that it plays a key role in numerous areas of the body including the maintenance of skin volume and hydration, eye volume and shape and joint lubrication and cushioning. TAG1  TAG1 in the decades since numerous therapeutic and aesthetic uses have been developed for this versatile substance. in 2003, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved the first hyaluronic acid dermal filler for the correction of facial wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds (the folds running from the sides of the bottom of the nose to the outer corners of the mouth, also known as “laugh lines”). TAG1  TAG1 today, hyaluronic acid-based dermal fillers are the fastest growing non-invasive aesthetic procedure in the united states, according to the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how is perlane different from restylane QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 perlane and restylane are both composed of a compound naturally present in the human body called hyaluronic acid. the primary difference between restylane and perlane is the hyaluronic acid gel particles in perlane are larger than those found in restylane. this affords perlane the ability to lift and fill the areas of injection that require a denser formulation. perlane and restylane are excellent complements to one another (e.g., the lip and the white and red lip junction, anatomically called the vermilion border).

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1   TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how does laser hair removal work QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 laser therapy targets hair that is actively growing at the time of treatment. the laser removes hair when the hair follicle absorbs the light energy from the laser resulting in the absence of further hair growth. many laser systems have a built-in cooling apparatus that reduces discomfort and protects the surface of your skin, leaving the surrounding skin unaffected by the treatment. multiple treatments are necessary. the exact number of treatments is dependent on the anatomic location, color, amount, density and growth rate of each individual’s hair. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what causes skin damage QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 exposure to the sun and chronic low-grade inflammation are the primary causes of skin damage. the sun’s damaging effects come from ultraviolet light and heat. excessive sun exposure can cause skin cancer, wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, rough texture and broken blood vessels. what we recognize as “aging” is largely due to sun damage. chronic inflammation of the skin can be a secondary effect of acne, dermatitis, rosacea, allergies, exposure to weather, bacteria or environmental toxins, smoking, drug or alcohol use. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 how do we prevent skin damage QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 antioxidants protect the body and the skin from free radical damage. regular application of skin products that contain active vitamin c, vitamin e, green tea and other potent antioxidants that protect the skin by neutralizing free radicals. of course, protection with a sunblock is the most important step. a diet rich in antioxidants may also benefit the skin. other techniques that can significantly improve the health and appearance of your skin include avoiding smoking, hydration and regular exercise. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what does microdermabrasion do QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 microdermabrasion is an exfoliating technique that helps repair the effects of the sun and aging. microdermabrasion is performed using a device that gently sprays a jet of fine crystals across the skin’s surface, mixing gentle abrasion with suction to remove the outer layers of dead skin. this process allows your skin to be restored to a more refined appearance and a smoother texture. some of the benefits of microdermabrasion are: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 softer skin TAG2  TAG2 minimal to no down time TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 what are chemical peels QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the professional peel process eliminates damage and rejuvenates the skin. peel products exfoliate and stimulate the skin. light peels rejuvenate the upper layers of the skin. these types of chemical peels are typically performed by a skin care specialist, such as an esthetician. medium and deep peels can achieve dramatic results after one or two treatments and are also performed by medical aesthetic professionals. TAG1  TAG1 light peels are usually made of alpha and beta hydroxy acids, such as, lactic acid, a by product of milk; glycolic acid, a by product of sugar; and salicylic acid, from the same source as aspirin. enzyme peels are very mild made from fruit such as papaya, pumpkin, and grape. TAG1  TAG1 the decision about which specific peel or series of peels to have should be made in collaboration with a knowledgeable skin care professional. together, you can design an effective treatment plan that will give you the results you want – beautiful skin at every age. for optimal results a series of treatments is recommended.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what cosmetic concerns can be treated QUESTION  TAG2 tummy tuck surgery is designed to improve the appearance of a prominent lower stomach region, which is often caused by loose, excess skin and lax abdominal muscles. in many instances, stubborn deposits of fat in and around the abdomen can also be removed. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what does the procedure entail QUESTION  TAG2 though the procedure will be tailored to address each patient’s unique needs and goals, abdominoplasty generally involves the tightening of abdominal muscles, the excision of excess skin, and the removal of fat via  TAG2 liposuction TAG2 . during a full tummy tuck, an incision will typically be made low on the abdomen, extending from one hip to the other. similarly, the incision for a mini tummy tuck will be concealed low on the abdomen, though it is often a bit shorter in length. depending on the technique and extent of work involved, the operation generally takes approximately two to four hours to complete. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what’s the difference between a full and mini tummy tuck QUESTION  TAG2 both full and mini abdominoplasties involve the tightening of abdominal muscles and the removal of excess skin. the main difference is that the full tummy tuck is typically employed to rejuvenate the areas both above and below the belly button whereas the mini tummy tuck is generally confined to the lower abdomen below the belly button. to learn more, read my blog post  TAG2 here TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is recovery like QUESTION  TAG2 following tummy tuck surgery, drain tubes will need to be left in place for about one week. most patients experience some bruising and/or swelling, though these symptoms should subside over the course of a few weeks. the majority of individuals are able to return to non-strenuous jobs or activities after about one to two weeks; however, heavy lifting and/or strenuous physical labor should be avoided for at least six to eight weeks. to help facilitate healing, patients are often encouraged to walk around as soon as they feel comfortable enough to do so.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 why is the american board of plastic surgery certification important QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 having a surgeon who is board certified by the asps is incredibly crucial because they are held to a high standard when it comes to knowledge, experience and your overall care. not only do these physicians go through an extended amount of education in the specialty of plastic surgery, they are required to maintain continuous learning throughout their medical career. it is important to know and not be confused by other official sounding boards and certifications. the american board of plastic surgery is recognized by the american board of medical specialties. “board certifications” in “cosmetic surgery” are not recognized by the american board of medical specialties.

TAG1  TAG1 is it safe QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 although, like any surgery, plastic surgery comes with risks, these risks can be diminished with certain precautions. the first and most important precaution is to choose an experienced,  TAG2 board-certified plastic surgeon TAG2  like dr. bermudez to perform your surgery. unlike cosmetic surgeons, board-certified plastic surgeons have been certified by the american board of plastic surgery and have completed residencies in both surgery and plastic surgery. cosmetic surgeons are medical doctors with only supplemental training in cosmetic surgery. TAG1  TAG1 another way to mitigate any plastic surgery risks is by discussing your medical history with your surgeon in a thorough, one-on-one consultation before surgery. this way your surgeon will ensure that your body can handle the surgery, and he or she can plan for any possible complications. carefully following your plastic surgeon’s instructions before and after surgery will considerably diminish any surgery risks. TAG1  TAG1 will i have scars QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 anytime incisions are made in the body, scarring is inevitable. however, a careful and experienced plastic surgeon will know how to minimize the size and appearance of scars by making incisions in areas that are hidden by the body’s natural lines or by clothing. TAG1  TAG1 dr. bermudez also offers procedures that use tiny incisions, like the  TAG2 vaser liposuction TAG2  method. these incisions, and resulting scars, are significantly smaller than with other body contouring procedures. but even larger and more noticeable scarring will fade over time with the right post-surgery regimen. dr. bermudez can walk you through everything you need to do during recovery to ensure that scarring is kept at a minimum. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 will i still look like myself QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 the goal of any good plastic surgeon is to help you look like a better version of yourself. this means providing you the most natural-looking results, and a board-certified plastic surgeon with years of experience is an expert at this craft. TAG1  TAG1 natural-looking results are due to a plastic surgeon’s careful planning and understanding of the patient’s goals for the surgery. the latter is gathered in a pre-surgery consultation, where patients are encouraged to ask the surgeon questions and share their medical history. a well-trained, qualified surgeon will then be able to achieve the aesthetic you’re after while retaining the physical characteristics that make you. TAG1  TAG1 and after surgery, once you’re fully recovered, no one will know you’ve had any work done. they will just wonder why you suddenly look younger and more attractive! TAG1  TAG1 what can i expect during recovery QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 since every plastic surgery procedure is different, the recovery for that procedure will also be different. the recovery period after an injectable treatment is, for instance, much shorter than recovery from  TAG2 breast augmentation surgery TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 in your pre-surgery consultation with dr. bermudez, he will outline exactly what to expect from your plastic surgery recovery. this includes how long the recovery period will last, how long you can expect to take off work and household chores, and when you can expect to return to normal daily activities and exercise. TAG1  TAG1 dr. bermudez does everything he can to empower his patients by educating them on what to expect during every step of their surgery, including how to make their recovery as comfortable and short as possible. TAG1  TAG1 will my results last QUESTION  TAG1  TAG1 plastic surgery is meant to enhance and turn back the clock on your appearance. unfortunately, it is not the fountain of youth—it can’t stop the hands of time forever. TAG1  TAG1 after plastic surgery, you will continue to see the signs of aging on your face and body. the good news, however, is that you will have “reset” the hands of time to an earlier point, causing you to seemingly age at a slower rate. of course, maintaining healthy lifestyle choices such as eating right, exercising, and staying out of the sun will maximize the time you will enjoy your new, younger look.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much time will i need to recover after an arm lift QUESTION  TAG2 following arm lift surgery, patients typically need 1 – 2 weeks before returning to work. during the first week of recovery, try to get light exercise like walking and avoid activities that raise your blood pressure, as this could cause bleeding at the operative site. avoid exercises and movements that directly stress the area of your surgery like weight lifting for 4 weeks after your procedure. after a month, patients can generally begin more strenuous cardiovascular exercise like riding a stationary bike or brisk walking. avoid heavy lifting, contact sports and jogging for up to 6 weeks. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 where is the incision made during an arm lift QUESTION  TAG2 during arm lift surgery (brachioplasty), there are three primary locations where an incision may be made depending on the individual situation, needs, and preferences of the patient. an incision can be made in the armpit, lengthwise along the front side of the arm, or lengthwise along the back side of the arm. a consultation with an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon is required before an  TAG2 arm lift TAG2  to discuss the different incision methods and determine the most beneficial surgical path. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can arm lift surgery be combined with other cosmetic surgery procedures QUESTION  TAG2 as long as the patient is healthy enough, there is no reason that an arm lift cannot be combined with other cosmetic surgery procedures. combining surgeries can be an excellent way to achieve even more comprehensive aesthetic results and cutdown on overall recovery time. it’s common for people to combine their arm lift with other body contouring procedures like liposuction or a thigh lift. however, it’s important to discuss this with your board-certified plastic surgeon to determine if combining procedures is the right approach for you. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 breast augmentation: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i know what size of breast implants to choose QUESTION  TAG2 patients who are considering breast augmentation have a wealth of options, from selecting the type of implants (like silicone, saline, or gummy bear) to choosing a size. the size of a patient’s breast implants depends largely on the patient’s preference, as well as what is medically safe and feasible. during your personal consultation, dr. elliott will guide you through your various options and help you reach a decision that you feel comfortable with. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can breast augmentation be performed without breast implants QUESTION  TAG2 for women who prefer a subtler breast enhancement, breast augmentation can be performed using fat transfer injections to the breast instead of implants. during the procedure, fat is removed from the patient’s body with liposuction. the fat is then purified and injected in to the breasts to create a modest, natural-looking increase in breast size. it’s important to note that only about 60% of the injected fat will survive over time, so the patient should anticipate some reduction in breast size relative to the results immediately following the procedure and may require a follow-up procedure for further enhancement down the road. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 are there are non-surgical alternatives to breast augmentation QUESTION  TAG2 for women who want to increase the size and volume of their breasts, breast augmentation surgery is still the best way to achieve this aesthetic result. there are no creams, supplements, or medications that can effectively help a woman increase her breast size. fat transfer injections to the breast that use a patient’s own fat that is removed with liposuction can help provide a modest increase in breast size, but they will not be able to replicate the results of breast implants. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what can cause a breast implant to rupture QUESTION  TAG2 a rupture may occur when the shell of the implant breaks, but the fibrous capsule formed by the breast remains intact. a ruptured implant causes the fibrous tissue to become inflamed and form scar tissue around the breast. this is known as capsular contracture. the scar tissue can often produce pain or discomfort in the affected breast, as well as changes in size and firmness. this can be treated with a breast revision procedure. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what are the warning signs of capsular contracture QUESTION  TAG2 the first sign to look out for if you’re concerned about capsular contracture is a firmness or hardening around the affected breast. this is often followed by intense pain or discomfort. it’s not atypical for the  TAG2 breast implants TAG2  to become misshapen or unnatural-looking. if you think you may be experiencing capsular contracture, it’s important to speak with a board-certified plastic surgeon as soon as possible. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what breast implant options do breast augmentation patients have to choose from QUESTION  TAG2 before undergoing breast augmentation surgery, prospective patients must make a series of decisions about their potential implant options. this includes choosing which breast implant material (silicone, saline, and cohesive silicone gel-filled) they prefer, implant size, shape, placement on the breast, and more. we will discuss all possible options and alternatives during breast augmentation consultation appointments and patients will even have the chance to try of different potential implant sizes. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how painful is a breast revision surgery QUESTION  TAG2 breast revision surgery is meant to help patients alter the results of a previous breast augmentation procedure by removing and/or replacing the breast implants. breast revision, like initial breast augmentation procedures, is not especially painful and recovery is fairly straightforward. for some patients, recovery from breast revision can be easier than the recovery from the original procedure since the pocket to hold the implant has already been created. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i choose between breast augmentation and breast lift surgery QUESTION  TAG2 when deciding between breast augmentation and breast lift surgery, it’s important to consider the main objectives of these specific procedures. breast augmentation is recommended for women who are interested in increasing the size, volume, and shape of their breasts. a breast lift may be required for women who experience breast sagging and would like to achieve younger-looking, perkier breasts. some women may choose to combine these two procedures in order to achieve even more comprehensive results. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 breast lift: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will a breast lift change the size of my breasts QUESTION  TAG2 a breast lift procedure focuses on the height of the breasts, and generally does not affect their size. however, many mastopexy (or breast lift) patients do want their breasts to be larger or smaller in addition to looking younger. in this case, dr. elliott can often combine the breast lift with either a breast reduction or a breast augmentation. having both procedures in one surgery can cut down on recovery time and costs and can help patients achieve the results they’re looking for sooner. however, each patient’s cosmetic goals and medical needs are unique, so the first step is a consultation with dr. elliott to discuss your surgical options. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is the difference between a breast lift and a breast reduction QUESTION  TAG2 although it is common for patients to associate these two procedures with each other, they are very different surgeries with very different results. a breast lift is performed for patients who want to lift or reposition breasts that sag, whereas a breast reduction actually alters the size of the breast itself. during a breast lift, skin is removed to help reshape the breasts and then the breast tissue is repositioned to provide a perkier, younger-looking breast contour. a breast reduction procedure involves removing excess breast tissue, fat, and skin. certain patients prefer to combine breast reduction surgery with a breast lift for more comprehensive results. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 who are good candidates for a breast lift QUESTION  TAG2 any woman who experiences significant breast sagging and wants to improve the shape and positioning of her breasts may be a good candidate for a breast lift. breast lift candidates must be in good overall health to undergo the procedure. in addition to providing perkier, younger-looking breasts, a breast lift can also help patients who have elongated breasts, downward pointed nipples, enlarged areolas and/or stretched breast skin. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long do the final results of a breast lift last QUESTION  TAG2 when performed by an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon, the  TAG2 results of breast lift surgery TAG2  are intended to be long-lasting. it’s important to follow your plastic surgeon’s post-surgery instructions closely during your recovery period in order to promote the best-possible long-term results. certain changes to the body that occur due to natural aging, weight fluctuation, or becoming pregnant can impact the results of a breast lift over time. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 does a breast lift require breast implants QUESTION  TAG2 no. although many women do choose to combine their breast lift surgery with breast augmentation to achieve even more comprehensive results, you can absolutely undergo breast lift surgery without getting breast implants. breast lift surgery can help women who wish to achieve perkier, better-positioned breasts by removing excess skin and repositioning tissue from the breast area. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can performing chest exercises help lift my breasts QUESTION  TAG2 unfortunately, breast sagging cannot be successfully addressed with exercises. since breast sagging is caused by factors that affect the skin and tissue of the breast over time like gravity or weight fluctuation, the only way to effectively lift the breasts is to undergo breast lift surgery. during a breast lift, sagging skin is removed from the breast and remaining tissue is repositioned to create a perkier, younger-looking breast contour. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will i need to undergo a breast lift after breast implant removal QUESTION  TAG2 although it’s true that many women who have their breast implants removed do choose to undergo breast lift surgery, it is ultimately up to the patient. it’s simply a matter of aesthetic preference and if having the implant removed has led to stretched skin and breast sagging. this is particularly common for women with smaller natural breasts who have larger breast implants. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 breast reduction: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is breast reduction always performed with a breast lift QUESTION  TAG2 not always. it is quite common to combine these two procedures into one surgery, but some women who undergo a breast reduction may not have a large amount of breast tissue removed. a breast lift will only be needed for women who experience stretched skin or breast sagging. we will determine this at your consultation and discuss all your possible surgical options. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 at what age is it safe to have breast reduction surgery QUESTION  TAG2 breast reduction is intended to reduce the size and volume of the breasts to create a more proportional body contour. although there is no specific age requirement for women who are interested in breast reduction surgery, i normally recommend patients wait until their breasts have fully grown and developed before undergoing the procedure. continued growth and development in the breast area can negatively affect the results of your breast reduction. additionally, other changes that occur in the body over time like significant weight fluctuation or pregnancy can have similar adverse effects on a patient’s breast reduction results. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can breast reduction surgery help treat back pain QUESTION  TAG2 in many cases, undergoing breast reduction surgery can help women with larger breasts  TAG2 alleviate some degree of pain in their back or neck TAG2 . it can also help with posture issues. larger, heavier breasts can put a high level of stress on the spine. breast reduction surgery can help reduce the volume and weight of the breasts to help women who experience these difficulties while also helping to achieve a more proportional silhouette. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is there a way to reduce my breast size without surgery QUESTION  TAG2 unfortunately not. chest exercises and weight loss can help reduce some amount of fat in the breast area, but they will not be able to reduce excess breast tissue responsible for larger breasts. additionally, there are no medications or supplements that can help people reduce the size of their breasts. undergoing breast reduction surgery is the only viable, dependable option for women and men who wish to reduce the size and volume of their breasts. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 who are good candidates for breast reduction QUESTION  TAG2 good candidates for breast reduction include women who wish to reduce the size and volume of their breasts. ideal candidates should be in good mental and physical health coming into their surgery. breast reduction candidates should be non-smokers, as nicotine can cause complications during surgery and recovery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long is recovery following breast reduction QUESTION  TAG2 although this can vary from patient-to-patient, it’s common for patients to resume their normal daily activities (including work) after one to two weeks. this can be longer for people with jobs that require strenuous labor or lifting. some soreness, bruising, and swelling will occur in the days after surgery, but wearing a compression garment can help minimize this and this will gradually fade over time. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 eyelid surgery: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how does eyelid surgery improve the appearance of bags under the eyes QUESTION  TAG2 bags under the eyes are caused by fat deposits. genetics are often to blame for these fat deposits, but they tend to grow more prominent with age when the rest of the face loses volume. lower eyelid surgery, or lower blepharoplasty, removes the fat deposits to create a smoother, more youthful appearance. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long does it take to recover from eyelid surgery QUESTION  TAG2 full recovery from eyelid surgery (aka blepharoplasty) can take multiple weeks, but you will begin to notice progress soon after your procedure. the stitches are typically removed just a few days after your surgery. during the first week of your recovery, it’s important to give your eyes plenty of rest. most patients can return to work after three to seven days, but this does vary from patient to patient. any redness, swelling, or bruising that you experience after your procedure should fade within a week to ten days as well. you may begin exercising again after about two weeks, but there may be some restrictions that will be discussed in more detail during your post-surgical follow-up appointments. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can a brow lift and eyelid surgery be performed at the same time QUESTION  TAG2 as long as the patient is healthy enough to undergo their surgery, it is generally safe to  TAG2 combine eyelid surgery with a brow lift TAG2 . some patients prefer to have both procedures done at the same time to achieve more comprehensive aesthetic results, reduce costs, and cut down on overall recovery time. but every patient is different and combining procedures may not be the right approach for everyone. this is something we can discuss during your plastic surgery consultation. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will eyelid surgery make male patients look more feminine QUESTION  TAG2 this is a common concern for men considering eyelid surgery. however, there are specific techniques used on male patients during eyelid surgery to help refresh the appearance of the eyes while retaining their more masculine features. i recommend asking your plastic surgeon to see before and after photos of their past eyelid procedures on male patients to confirm that they can provide the results that you hope to achieve. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long after eyelid surgery can i start wearing makeup again QUESTION  TAG2 i typically recommend for eyelid surgery patients to wait at least one week after their stitches have been removed after surgery before applying makeup or other cosmetics to the area around the eyes. since makeup can cause the area to become irritated and potentially re-open the surgical wound, or lead to an infection, it’s better to be safe than sorry. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 fat transfer injections: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what areas can be treated with fat transfer injections QUESTION  TAG2 fat transfer injections use the patient’s own fat that is removed from areas like the abdomen or thighs during liposuction to help add lost volume to different areas of the face and body. after it has been removed, the fat is then purified and re-injected to restore volume to the cheeks and lips, creating a similar effect to injectable facial fillers. fat transfer injections can also be used to help patients who want to safely rejuvenate the appearance of the breasts, buttocks, and more. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 are fat transfer injections considered safe QUESTION  TAG2 when performed by an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon, fat transfer injections are typically very safe. fat transfer can be a helpful way for patients who want to add volume to areas like the breasts, face, and buttocks. since fat transfer injections only use purified fat that is removed from the patient’s own body during liposuction, there is only a minimal risk of an adverse reaction to your treatment. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 who are good candidates for fat transfer injections for the breasts QUESTION  TAG2 women who seek a more modest, subtle increase in breast size may be good candidates for breast enhancement with fat transfer injections. some women prefer a more subtle and less invasive procedure method, when compared to traditional breast augmentation with breast implants. additionally, fat transfer injections may be used in conjunction with breast implants to help achieve a more defined shape during breast augmentation. some women may use fat transfer injections to help restore their breasts after radiation treatments for breast cancer. a woman must have enough available excess fat to successfully perform a fat transfer procedure. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 if i want fat transfer, what area should i have the fat removed from QUESTION  TAG2 every patient is different. determining the best area to extract fat from depends on each patient’s unique anatomy. regardless of where the fat is removed from, the fat transfer injection process will be the same. the key is finding the area(s) that will provide the best improvement in body contour, or where fat is most readily available. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 liposuction: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long will the results of a liposuction procedure last QUESTION  TAG2 liposuction removes excess fat cells from a targeted area of the body, and can be a great way for patients who are already maintaining a healthy weight to minimize localized pockets of unwanted fat. the fat cells that have been removed will not return. however, if a patient gains weight after their procedure, the remaining fat cells in the treated area as well as fat cells in other areas of the body can expand, making the patient’s results less apparent. in other words, liposuction results can be extremely long lasting if the patient maintains their post-procedure weight, but subsequent weight gain in the treated area is still a possibility. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 i’ve heard that breasts are largely made up of fat. can’t i just use liposuction for breast reduction QUESTION  TAG2 you’re correct that there is some degree of fat in the breasts. however, in order for breast reduction to truly be successful in providing the cosmetic results that you want while also relieving the physical burdens that excessive breasts cause, such as back pain and shoulder pain, the best option is a true breast reduction. unlike liposuction, which uses a very narrow tube to remove fat cells alone without affecting other types of tissue, a breast reduction involves removing fat as well as breast tissue and skin for a comprehensive result. not only will breast reduction surgery allow me as your plastic surgeon to remove the precise amount and type of tissue necessary, but it will also allow me to sculpt your breasts into an attractive and youthful shape, rather than leaving the significant laxity that liposuction would result in. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much scarring will i experience after liposuction QUESTION  TAG2 the incisions made during a liposuction procedure are quite small (sometimes only a few millimeters), meaning that post-surgery scarring is typically very minor. during liposuction, i work hard to make incisions in more concealed, less naturally visible areas to help keep them less noticeable. keep in mind that liposuction scars will also fade considerably over time. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what areas of the body can be treated with liposuction QUESTION  TAG2 as long as your surgery is performed by an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon,  TAG2 liposuction can safely and effectively be used on areas all over the body TAG2 . this can include the abdomen, hips, back, flanks, neck, thighs, breasts, and more. before any liposuction procedure, a consultation with your plastic surgeon will be required to determine which areas of your body can be safely treated with liposuction. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will liposuction help me treat the appearance of cellulite QUESTION  TAG2 although it is true that undergoing liposuction can sometimes reduce the appearance of some cellulite for some patients in certain areas, this is not a result that patients should expect. during liposuction, excess fat is removed from the body. since cellulite occurs when there is an accumulation of damaged fatty tissue below the surface of the skin, it cannot be treated by just removing the fat from the area. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 male breast reduction: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will i have extensive scars after male breast reduction QUESTION  TAG2 each man’s breast reduction is unique based on the type of tissue being removed. for men with the condition gynecomastia, the chest area may have excess breast tissue which creates an appearance similar to female breasts. in this case, the issue can often be resolved using a small, discrete incision around the bottom of the areola to allow for the removal of the breast tissue. for patients whose primary concern is excess fat in the chest area, liposuction alone may be able to produce a satisfying result. liposuction only requires a few incisions that are large enough for the narrow metal tube used to remove the fat, so the incisions are only a few millimeters long and they leave little or no visible scarring. for men who have also lost extensive amounts of weight and, as a result, have excess skin in the chest that needs to be removed, a scar along the natural creases of the pectoral area may be necessary. ultimately, it will depend on your unique needs, which i can evaluate during your in-personal consultation. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long will the results of male breast reduction surgery last QUESTION  TAG2 the results of male breast reduction can be extremely long-lasting. gynecomastia, or enlarged breasts in men, is caused by an excess of glandular breast tissue. since male breast reduction removes the excess breast tissue, the results from your procedure can last a lifetime. however, in order to maintain your results, it’s important to follow your post-surgery instructions closely. steroid use, abuse of recreational drugs like marijuana, certain medical conditions, or even considerable weight gain can lead to a recurrence of your gynecomastia. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can male breast enlargement be treated without surgery QUESTION  TAG2 unfortunately not. gynecomastia, a condition in which excess glandular breast tissue causes an enlargement of the male breast, can only be successfully treated with male breast reduction surgery. since the condition is genetic in nature and caused by an excess of tissue and not fat, diet and exercise will not be able to reduce the contour of the chest area. additionally, there are no known medicinal treatments that can successfully treat gynecomastia. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 when will i see results following male breast reduction surgery QUESTION  TAG2 after surgery, there will be swelling in the chest area that can obscure the results of your procedure. this will likely persist for 1-2 weeks following surgery (possibly longer in some cases). once swelling has subsided, you will notice significant aesthetic results that will only improve with time as all residual post-surgery swelling fades. this occurs over 2-3 months. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what causes male breast enlargement QUESTION  TAG2 the causes of male breast enlargement can vary from person to person. in adolescents, it is often caused by hormonal changes associated with puberty. in these cases, the breast enlargement will normally subside naturally. in adults, breast enlargement is often caused by excess glandular breast tissue (gynecomastia) that requires male breast reduction surgery to effectively remove. for some guys who just experience excess fat in the chest area this can be treated with liposuction. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 mommy makeover: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is a mommy makeover QUESTION  TAG2 a mommy makeover is a plastic surgery which combines multiple procedures in order to improve the areas of a woman’s body that have been aesthetically impacted by past pregnancies. while every mommy makeover depends on the individual patient’s needs, these surgeries typically involve a breast procedure (whether it be an augmentation, a reduction, or a lift), a tummy tuck, and liposuction. using a single surgery for multiple cosmetic procedures can allow patients to achieve the end result they’re looking for with less recovery time and expense than several individual surgeries would require, but a consultation is the first step toward determining whether you’re a candidate for a mommy makeover. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will there be significant weight loss after a mommy makeover QUESTION  TAG2 unfortunately not. a mommy makeover and its component procedures (liposuction, tummy tuck, and cosmetic breast surgery) are meant to provide body contouring improvements, not weight loss. while it is true that excess skin and fatty tissue is removed during a mommy makeover, what is removed typically does not weigh that much. this is why i recommend that my mommy makeover patients reach their goal weight before undergoing their procedure in order to achieve the best results possible. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is it safe to combine multiple plastic surgery procedures QUESTION  TAG2 as long as the patient is in good physical and mental health, combining cosmetic surgery procedures can be a great way to achieve more comprehensive aesthetic results, while cutting down on overall recovery time and costs of multiple surgeries. as an example, many patients  TAG2 combine a cosmetic breast surgery with a tummy tuck as part of a mommy makeover TAG2 . however, combining procedures is not necessarily the right approach for everyone. it’s important to consult with your board-certified plastic surgeon to find out if you are healthy enough to combine plastic surgery procedures. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 are there risks associated with a mommy makeover procedure QUESTION  TAG2 while it’s true any cosmetic surgery procedure can lead to certain potential complications and risk, when performed by an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon, a mommy makeover is typically a very safe procedure. to help minimize your risk of surgery complications, it’s important to be in good physical and mental health before your surgery. it’s also very important to work with a board-certified plastic surgeon with considerable experience performing mommy makeovers and follow their pre and post-surgery instructions closely. ask your doctor if he or she is board certified by the american board of plastic surgeons. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how should i prepare for a mommy makeover QUESTION  TAG2 patients should be in good physical and mental health before mommy makeover surgery, including reaching a stable ideal bodyweight. mommy makeover patients should stop all tobacco/nicotine use for at least 3 weeks before and after their procedure (and ideally not smoke or use nicotine all together) to promote good healing. alcohol consumption should be limited to less than 1-3 drinks per week leading up to surgery. avoid aspirin and other anti-inflammatory medications (advil, motrin, etc.) that can increase bleeding for 2 weeks before and after your procedure. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how do i choose between a mommy makeover and individual procedures QUESTION  TAG2 every patient is different, however i often recommend for patients who are considering multiple cosmetic procedures like a tummy tuck and cosmetic breast surgery to combine these procedures into one treatment session as part of a mommy makeover. the benefits of a mommy makeover include achieving more comprehensive aesthetic results while cutting down on overall recovery time and hospital costs. we will discuss your options and whether or not you are a good candidate during a pre-surgery consultation appointment. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 other facial procedures: TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what’s the difference between a traditional facelift and a short scar facelift QUESTION  TAG2 both of these procedures restore firmness to facial skin that has become lax and wrinkled by the aging process. however, a facelift traditionally uses an incision within the creases of the face and the hairline behind the ear.  TAG2 a short scar facelift TAG2 , on the other hand, only requires small incisions concealed by the temporal hair and extending downward in front of the earlobe, so the procedure is less invasive and scarring is minimized. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long will the results of ear surgery last QUESTION  TAG2 although the effects of anti-aging procedures like facelifts are inherently temporary, because new signs of aging are always forming, the structure of the ears changes very little throughout our lives. therefore, the results of plastic surgery on the ears can easily last into the patient’s adulthood and beyond. keep in mind, however, that in order for you to attain the results you’re looking for, it’s important to follow your post-surgical instructions closely, including keeping your bandages on for a specified period of time so they can support your ears’ new shape. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long will i need to recover after chin surgery QUESTION  TAG2 patients can normally resume their daily routine about ten days after their chin surgery procedure, though they should refrain from more strenuous activities for a few weeks. patients can typically begin more intense, high impact exercises again roughly four to six weeks after their surgery. keep in mind that with any plastic surgery, it can take several months for all residual swelling to fade so that your final results are truly settled. it is important to closely follow all of your post-surgical instructions and maintain communication with your plastic surgeon in order to successfully heal and achieve the best possible results from your chin surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can a neck lift be performed on its own or does it need to be combined with a facelift QUESTION  TAG2 although neck lifts are commonly combined with other procedures like a facelift, chin surgery, or eyelid surgery to provide more comprehensive cosmetic results to the face and neck area, the procedure absolutely can be performed as a stand-alone surgery. during a neck lift, excess skin is removed, and sagging neck muscles are tightened to improve definition and create a more-toned, younger-looking appearance. depending on the patient’s needs, i may also use liposuction to remove excess fat in the neck and jowl area. for men i often just take out the excess skin directly by simply removing whatever is excessive in the front of the neck under the chin. while this does leave a scar, it is hard to see in this location after 3-4 weeks and it is a simple procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much visible scarring will there be after ear surgery QUESTION  TAG2 as with any other cosmetic surgery procedure (especially facial procedures), scarring is a common concern for patients undergoing ear surgery. during an ear lift (otoplasty), i am able to make very small incisions in the back of the ear, which helps keep visible scarring very minimal after ear surgery. some patients may require their incisions to be made in the front of the ear. in these cases, i am careful to make the incision as discreetly as possible to help limit visible scarring. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can i combine a short scar facelift with other facial rejuvenation procedures QUESTION  TAG2 for many patients, a short scar facelift can be paired with another facial cosmetic procedure to help achieve even more comprehensive aesthetic results. for example, it’s quite common to combine a short scar facelift with eyelid surgery. in addition to achieving greater results, combining multiple surgeries into one procedure can help cut down on total recovery and surgical costs. however, not everyone is a candidate for this kind of combination procedure. so, it’s important to speak with a board-certified plastic surgeon first to confirm that combining your short scar facelift with another cosmetic procedure is the right choice for you. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can chin surgery be combined with other cosmetic procedures QUESTION  TAG2 for patients who are healthy enough to undergo multiple procedures in one sitting, chin surgery can be combined with other  TAG2 cosmetic surgery procedures for the face TAG2  including rhinoplasty and ear surgery. in some cases, an additional procedure may be recommended to help keep the balance of the facial features intact following a chin augmentation or chin reduction surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long will it take to recover after a short scar facelift QUESTION  TAG2 generally speaking, the recovery period following a short scar facelift is the same as recovery from a traditional facelift. patient should expect some degree of swelling and bruising for about 2 weeks following surgery, however swelling can sometimes persist longer. patients can normally resume daily activities like work after 2 weeks and exercise after 3 – 4 weeks depending on the nature of their work and exercise routine. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can ear surgery be used to treat asymmetry in one ear QUESTION  TAG2 absolutely. for patients who experience one ear that is pointier, misshapen, or different in size than the other, ear surgery can be used to correct this and provide a more balanced appearance. it’s important to first speak with a board-certified plastic surgeon to confirm that you are a good candidate for this procedure. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 post-weight loss surgery: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is weight-loss surgery needed after considerable weight loss or can my skin recover on its own QUESTION   TAG2 post-weight loss surgery is intended to help patients get rid of their loose, excess skin after their weight loss. for patients who experience sagging skin following their weight loss, post-weight loss surgery can provide comfort and an improvement to the appearance of their skin. while the procedure is not a requirement, it is highly unlikely that their skin will correct itself after massive weight loss without surgery. it’s a matter of personal aesthetic preference. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 am i a good candidate for post-weight loss surgery QUESTION  TAG2 a good post-weight loss surgery candidate is typically someone who has experienced a considerable amount of loose, sagging skin in one or multiple areas of their body after significant weight loss. ideally, you are a good candidate for post-weight loss surgery if you are at your healthy goal weight before undergoing your surgery. it’s important for patients to be in good mental and physical health and maintain positive, but realistic expectations for their procedure and recovery. patients must quit smoking and other forms of nicotine before their surgery, as nicotine can lead to complications and affect the body’s ability to properly recover after surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is it possible to undergo multiple post-weight loss procedures in one surgery session QUESTION  TAG2 in some cases, it is safe and very beneficial for patients to combine multiple post-weight loss procedures into one surgery. for example, some patients can safely combine tummy tuck surgery with an arm lift. combining procedures can help patients achieve even more comprehensive body contouring results while cutting down on recovery time and surgical costs. however, it’s important to remember that combining procedures may not be an option for every patient. this is something you should ask about during your consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 rhinoplasty: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 at what age can a teenager safely have rhinoplasty QUESTION  TAG2 medically, the nose reaches nearly its full adult size by around age 14-15 (or sometimes a couple of years older for boys), and at this point, surgery may be an option to make cosmetic changes to the shape and/or size of the nose. however, keep in mind that rhinoplasty is a true surgery, so it requires patients to be firmly committed to their health throughout the preparation and the recovery. as a result, a teenager’s maturity level and their comprehension of the procedure will determine whether or not they are a candidate, so some patients may achieve a better result if they wait until their later teen years or into adulthood. all the factors that affect cosmetic nose surgery will be discussed at a pre-surgical consultation, where i can meet the potential patient (and the parents, if applicable), examine the patient’s nose, and make a confident recommendation. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long will the results of rhinoplasty last QUESTION  TAG2 regardless of whether it was performed to alter the shape or size of the nose, smooth out bumps or depressions, or correct issues with the nostrils,  TAG2 the results of a rhinoplasty TAG2  are intended to last a lifetime. as you age, your nose may experience normal drooping, however a rhinoplasty can strengthen the nose and allow for more graceful aging. if properly performed by a board-certified plastic surgeon, a rhinoplasty should not require any additional maintenance over time. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 does a rhinoplasty procedure offer any medical benefits QUESTION  TAG2 in addition to providing outstanding aesthetic results for patients who want to alter the size, shape, or contour of their nose, rhinoplasty surgery can also offer certain medical benefits for some people. breathing issues caused by a deviated septum or structural nasal obstructions can often be corrected with a rhinoplasty. rhinoplasty surgery can also help patients who have experienced a nasal fracture in the past. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can rhinoplasty be used to make a nose less wide QUESTION  TAG2 while rhinoplasty is thought of by some as a way to help resize the nose, for many patients the shape of the nose is as important as the size. rhinoplasty can help effectively reshape the nose for people who want to make their nose less wide, to refine the tip of the nose, or whatever change is necessary to help achieve the more balanced appearance they desire. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can a rhinoplasty be combined with other facial procedures QUESTION  TAG2 in many cases, yes, rhinoplasty can be combined with other cosmetic surgery procedures. it is most commonly combined with chin surgery. combining rhinoplasty with chin surgery can help some patients who wish to achieve even more complementary results by focusing on both features at one time and helping to attain better facial balance. undergoing both surgeries together can also help patients reduce their overall recovery time and surgical costs. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 thigh lift: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 who are good candidates for a thigh lift QUESTION  TAG2 thigh lift candidates are people who experience excess loose or stretched skin on their thighs as a result of considerable weight loss. a thigh lift can help remove excess skin from the inner (medial) thigh region and/or the outer (lateral) thigh. since a thigh lift is a body contouring procedure and not weight loss surgery, patients should be at or near their ideal weight before the time of their surgery. thigh lift patients should be non-smokers in good general health who maintain realistic expectations before and after their procedure. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much time will i need to recover following thigh lift surgery QUESTION  TAG2 recovery time after a thigh lift depends on the type of thigh lift procedure you undergo as well as your anatomy and healing ability. speaking generally, most patients can resume their normal daily activities (including work) within two to three weeks after surgery. it’s important to go easy on your legs and not put them under too much stress in the weeks following your thigh lift, as this can negatively impact your aesthetic results. patients can normally return to more strenuous exercise routines after six to eight weeks. following your pre and post-surgery instructions is crucial to a good recovery from your thigh lift. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how long will the results of a thigh lift last QUESTION  TAG2 the results achieved with thigh lift surgery are intended to be long-lasting. it’s important to maintain a stable, healthy body weight following your procedure in order to ensure the best-possible, long-term results. make sure to closely follow your plastic surgeon’s post-surgery instructions and attend regular follow-up appointments as instructed. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can a thigh lift be combined with other cosmetic procedures QUESTION  TAG2 yes. it’s common for thigh lift patients to combine their surgery with other cosmetic surgery procedures including a tummy tuck or a butt lift to provide more comprehensive body contouring. this is commonly referred to as a lower body lift. it’s important to confirm with your plastic surgeon that you are a good candidate to undergo a combined plastic surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 tummy tuck: TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is the difference between a tummy tuck and liposuction QUESTION  TAG2 essentially, liposuction specifically removes unwanted fat. a tummy tuck, on the other hand, focuses primarily on removing excess skin on your abdomen, which often becomes stretched due to pregnancy or weight fluctuations. a tummy tuck can also repair abdominal muscles which have changed shape as a result of pregnancy, and which can create a “pooch” on even a slender midsection. for patients who would benefit from skin firming and muscle repair as well as fat reduction, liposuction can often be combined with a tummy tuck for a more comprehensive result. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 can i get a tummy tuck and then become pregnant in the future QUESTION  TAG2 though every woman’s body may respond differently to pregnancy and surgery, i recommend that all my patients wait until they are finished having children before undergoing a tummy tuck or any other body-contouring cosmetic procedure. during a tummy tuck, excess skin and tissue is removed from the abdomen and the abdominal muscles are tightened. by repairing any separation in the abdominal muscles that results from pregnancy or weight gain, a tummy tuck is able to create a flatter, trimmer midsection. the effects that pregnancy can have on the body before or after a tummy tuck (including weight gain, stretching of the skin and muscle separation) can negatively affect or even reverse some of the results of your procedure. some patients may require an additional tummy tuck or a mini tummy tuck to re-achieve their initial results before any subsequent pregnancy. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 will a tummy tuck help me lose weight QUESTION  TAG2 a tummy tuck is a  TAG2 body contouring procedure TAG2  and not weight loss surgery. this means that undergoing a tummy tuck will not help patients who seek to lose a considerable amount of weight. although fat is sometimes removed during a tummy tuck, the procedure primarily removes stretched, excess skin. the total amount of fat and skin removed during a tummy tuck doesn’t weigh very much. this is why tummy tuck patients should reach their goal weight before having their surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 could a tummy tuck potentially help alleviate posture issues QUESTION  TAG2 in addition to providing the outstanding aesthetic results it is most commonly known for, a tummy tuck can also provide a number of medical benefits including potentially improving posture. posture issues are very common for people who experience a loosening of the abdominal muscles. by surgically tightening these muscles (while also removing the excess skin and fat), a tummy tuck can add stability to the abdominal muscles, which may improve back support and posture. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 how much time is required for recovery after a tummy tuck QUESTION   TAG2 the amount of recovery time patients need after a tummy tuck can vary from patient-to-patient depending on their condition and the specific details of their procedure. however, recovery after a tummy tuck is typically pretty straightforward. in most cases, patients are able to return to most of their normal daily activities like work 2 weeks after their procedure. some light physical activity like walking during recovery can even help keep your muscles active and help the healing process, but i would advise that patients wait 4-6 weeks before partaking in any strenuous exercise or heavy lifting. it’s also important to closely follow your board-certified plastic surgeon’s pre and post-surgery instructions to promote the smoothest possible recovery from your tummy tuck. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 who is a good candidate for a mini tummy tuck QUESTION  TAG2 a mini tummy tuck is designed to help patients who are seeking more minor re-contouring of their abdomen. unlike a full or traditional tummy tuck, the mini tummy tuck is focused specifically on addressing the area below the navel. during a mini tummy tuck, excess skin is removed between the bellybutton and pubic area. it’s important to speak first to a board-certified plastic surgeon to determine if a mini tummy tuck will be able to help you achieve your aesthetic goals. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what are the different types of tummy tuck surgery QUESTION  TAG2 depending on the patient’s specific needs and preferences, i may recommend one of three different types of tummy tuck procedures: standard tummy tuck, mini tummy tuck, or extended tummy tuck. a standard tummy tuck procedure is the most commonly-performed type of tummy tuck, while a mini tummy tuck may appeal to patients who only seek rejuvenation in the area below their navel. an extended tummy tuck can help address the flanks (or love handles) as well as the abdominal area.  we will discuss all these options in-depth during a tummy tuck consultation. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 is there a good non-surgical alternative to tummy tuck surgery QUESTION  TAG2 unfortunately not. although non-surgical fat reduction treatments can help some patients by removing excess fat from the abdomen, there is no non-surgical way to remove the excess skin and tissue that is removed during tummy tuck surgery. additionally, in many cases a tummy tuck is able to surgically repair abdominal muscles that may have become widened or damaged by pregnancy or other body changes and this cannot be corrected without surgery.

TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is a breast reduction QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the breast reduction procedure is an amazing surgical technique that was designed to reduce or eliminate the physical problems associated with having very large breasts.  removing excess fat, skin and glandular tissues creates smaller, firmer and ultimately, lighter breasts that are proportionate to the body size and type of the woman, thus alleviating the pain and discomfort of having disproportionately large breasts.  the breast reduction procedure can be combined with breast augmentation or breast lift surgeries to achieve a desired look, depending on the needs and desires of the individual patient. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is a tummy tuck QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 an effective way of eliminating the physical results of pregnancy, childbirth or dramatic weight loss, the tummy tuck procedure, also known as abdominoplasty, has been developed by plastic surgeons to tighten weak or collapsed stomach muscles and excise loose, flabby, excess skin and fatty deposits around the waistline.  the results are a tighter, smaller waistline and a more contoured mid-section, which can help clothes fit better and increase self-confidence.   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what happens during liposuction surgery QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 liposuction is a cosmetic enhancement surgery that involves the removal of fatty deposits from ‘trouble areas’ such as the thighs, stomach/waist, cheeks, chin and neck, as well as the hips, buttocks and upper arms.  by targeting specific areas of the body, liposuction is able to contour and smooth the skin with no major incisions, which makes liposuction an attractive alternative to more invasive surgical procedures.  however, for more dramatic cases, when performed liposuction is performed in conjunction with the tummy tuck, the results can be dramatic. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what can a facelift do for me QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 the face lift is a cosmetic enhancement surgery that restores sagging facial muscles and loose skin to a more youthful looking state by surgically removing excess skin and fatty deposits in the face, chin and jaw, while smoothing and tightening skin to create a rejuvenated, youthful look.  recovery times vary depending on the patient and extent of correction needed to achieve the desired results, but face lift patients typically see results begin to emerge after the third week after surgery and will fully recover after six months after surgery.   TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is rhinoplasty QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 rhinoplasty, or commonly known as nasal surgery, is performed to correct physiologocal as well as aesthetic defects such as a deviated septum and abnormalities as the result of prior injury or genetics.  these abnormalities can obstruct air flow into the lungs and cause breathing problems, snoring or sleep apnea.  patients also seek rhinoplasty to correct aesthetic defects, that when corrected provide balance and harmony to their facial features, thus complimenting their natural beauty.  the results of nasal surgery can be seen almost immediately and patients are able to return to work within days of surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what is blepharoplasty QUESTION  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 blepharoplasty, or commonly referred to as cosmetic eyelid surgery, is an elective surgical procedure used to remove wrinkles, excess fat and skin from around the upper and/or lower eyelids.  patients who undergo blepharoplasty typically complain of excess wrinkles, puffiness around the eyes, “bags” under the eyes and droopy eyelids.  incisions are made in inconspicuous places so that scarring is minimal and results are immediate.  patients who undergo blepharoplasty surgery typically enjoy results that are long-lasting and have the over all effect of looking younger and more alert.

TAG1  TAG1 	the consultation process in my practice (and in the practice of many other plastic surgeons) goes as follows TAG1  TAG1 	1) first consultation with a surgical consultant to discuss general information about the plastic surgery procedure they are considering. a pa, rn, or np will review health history and medications.  TAG1  TAG1 	2) second consultation, generally takes place a week or more after the first consultation. during this consultation, i will meet with the prospective patient and discuss the particulars of their surgery including recovery.  this is an hour long consultation. TAG1  TAG1 	3) patient will receive a quote for surgery and if the patient desires, surgery will be scheduled. busy plastic surgeons have a schedule that requires a wait period of almost always at least a month and in some cases much longer TAG1  TAG1 	4) pre-operative appointment. this is the final meeting with surgeon and patient prior to surgery to review surgery and recovery and answer any questions. TAG1  TAG1 	this process allows patients to get to know their plastic surgeon well and visa versa. if there is doubt about a patient being a good candidate for surgery for any reason, we have many opportunities to discover this. i have some wonderful patients who we insisted wait on surgery, sometimes people are in the very early healing process of a divorce or death of a spouse, others feel pressured by another person to have surgery. still other people think that plastic surgery is an answer to all their problems. sometimes it take a little time to get to know someone before some of these issues are revealed.  TAG1  TAG1 	unfortunately, too many physicians practicing cosmetic surgery, many of whom are not board-certified plastic surgeons seem more interested in getting a patient pre-qualified for financing and scheduling surgery as quickly as possible. in fact, some physicians even offer reduced rates for scheduling and paying for surgery by a particular date, creating additional pressure for a prospective patient. in this scenario, there is a higher likelyhood that a person who is not psychologically prepared for surgery will end up on the operating table.  TAG1  TAG1 	always search for a board certified plastic surgeon who is also a member of asaps TAG1  TAG1   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","FAQ"

TAG2 reconstructive surgery TAG2  includes  TAG2 craniofacial surgery TAG2 ,  TAG2 hand surgery TAG2 ,  TAG2 microsurgery TAG2 , and the treatment of  TAG2 burns TAG2 . while reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning, cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery aims at improving the appearance of it.

TAG2  TAG2 [2] TAG2  TAG2   this meaning in english is seen as early as 1598.

TAG2  TAG2 [8] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 sushruta TAG2  was a physician who made important contributions to the field of plastic and cataract surgery in 6th century bc. TAG2  TAG2 [9] TAG2  TAG2  the medical works of both sushruta and  TAG2 charaka TAG2 , originally in  TAG2 sanskrit TAG2 , were translated into the  TAG2 arabic language TAG2  during the abbasid caliphate in 750 ad. TAG2  TAG2 [10] TAG2  TAG2  the arabic translations made their way into  TAG2 europe TAG2  via intermediaries. TAG2  TAG2 [10] TAG2  TAG2  in  TAG2 italy TAG2 , the branca family TAG2  TAG2 [11] TAG2  TAG2  of  TAG2 sicily TAG2  and  TAG2 gaspare tagliacozzi TAG2  ( TAG2 bologna TAG2 ) became familiar with the techniques of sushruta.

TAG2  TAG2 [12] TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 joseph constantine carpue TAG2  spent 20 years in india studying local plastic surgery methods. TAG2  TAG2 [12] TAG2  TAG2  carpue was able to perform the first major surgery in the  TAG2 western world TAG2  in the year of 1815. TAG2  TAG2 [13] TAG2  TAG2  instruments described in the  TAG2  TAG2 sushruta samhita TAG2  TAG2  were further modified in the western world. TAG2  TAG2 [13] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 the roman scholar  TAG2 aulus cornelius celsus TAG2  recorded surgical techniques, including plastic surgery, in the first century ad. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the  TAG2 romans TAG2  also performed plastic cosmetic surgery. the romans were able to perform simple techniques, such as repairing damaged ears, from around the 1st century bc. for religious reasons, they did not dissect either human beings or animals, thus their knowledge was based in its entirety on the texts of their  TAG2 greek TAG2  predecessors. notwithstanding,  TAG2 aulus cornelius celsus TAG2  left some surprisingly accurate anatomical descriptions, TAG2  TAG2 [14] TAG2  TAG2  some of which — for instance, his studies on the genitalia and the skeleton — are of special interest to plastic surgery. TAG2  TAG2 [15] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in 1465, sabuncu's book, description, and classification of  TAG2 hypospadias TAG2  was more informative and up to date. localization of  TAG2 urethral meatus TAG2  was described in detail. sabuncuoglu also detailed the description and classification of ambiguous genitalia. TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 citation needed TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  in mid-15th-century europe, heinrich von pfolspeundt described a process &quot;to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, and the dogs have devoured it&quot; by removing skin from the back of the arm and suturing it in place. however, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not  TAG2 until the 19th and 20th centuries TAG2  that such surgery became common. TAG1  TAG1 up until the use of  TAG2 anesthesia TAG2  became established, surgeries involving healthy tissues involved great  TAG2 pain TAG2 . infection from surgery was reduced by the introduction of sterile techniques and disinfectants. the invention and use of antibiotics, beginning with  TAG2 sulfonamide TAG2  and  TAG2 penicillin TAG2 , was another step in making  TAG2 elective surgery TAG2  possible. TAG1  TAG1 in 1793,  TAG2 françois chopart TAG2  performed operative procedure on a lip using a flap from the neck. in 1814, joseph carpue successfully performed operative procedure on a british military officer who had lost his nose to the toxic effects of  TAG2 mercury TAG2  treatments. in 1818, german surgeon  TAG2 carl ferdinand von graefe TAG2  published his major work entitled  TAG2 rhinoplastik TAG2 . von graefe modified the italian method using a free skin graft from the arm instead of the original delayed pedicle flap. TAG1  TAG1 the first american plastic surgeon was  TAG2 john peter mettauer TAG2 , who, in 1827, performed the first  TAG2 cleft palate TAG2  operation with instruments that he designed himself. in 1845,  TAG2 johann friedrich dieffenbach TAG2  wrote a comprehensive text on rhinoplasty, titled  TAG2 operative chirurgie TAG2 , and introduced the concept of reoperation to improve the cosmetic appearance of the reconstructed nose. TAG1  TAG1 in 1891, american  TAG2 otorhinolaryngologist TAG2  john roe presented an example of his work: a young woman on whom he reduced a dorsal nasal hump for cosmetic indications. in 1892, robert weir experimented unsuccessfully with xenografts (duck sternum) in the reconstruction of sunken noses. in 1896,  TAG2 james israel TAG2 , a urological surgeon from germany, and in 1889 george monks of the united states each described the successful use of heterogeneous free-bone grafting to reconstruct saddle nose defects. in 1898, jacques joseph, the german orthopaedic-trained surgeon, published his first account of reduction rhinoplasty. in 1928, jacques joseph published  TAG2 nasenplastik und sonstige gesichtsplastik TAG2 .

TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the father of modern plastic surgery is generally considered to have been sir  TAG2 harold gillies TAG2 . a new zealand otolaryngologist working in london, he developed many of the techniques of modern facial surgery in caring for soldiers suffering from disfiguring facial injuries during the  TAG2 first world war TAG2 . TAG2  TAG2 [16] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 during  TAG2 world war i TAG2  he worked as a medical minder with the  TAG2 royal army medical corps TAG2 . after working with the renowned french  TAG2 oral and maxillofacial surgeon TAG2  TAG2 hippolyte morestin TAG2  on skin graft, he persuaded the army's chief surgeon,  TAG2 arbuthnot-lane TAG2 , to establish a facial injury ward at the  TAG2 cambridge military hospital TAG2 ,  TAG2 aldershot TAG2 , later upgraded to a new hospital for facial repairs at  TAG2 sidcup TAG2  in 1917. there gillies and his colleagues developed many techniques of plastic surgery; more than 11,000 operations were performed on more than 5,000 men (mostly soldiers with facial injuries, usually from gunshot wounds). TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 citation needed TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  after the war, gillies developed a private practice with rainsford mowlem, including many famous patients, and travelled extensively to promote his advanced techniques worldwide. TAG1  TAG1 in 1930, gillies' cousin,  TAG2 archibald mcindoe TAG2 , joined the practice and became committed to plastic surgery. when  TAG2 world war ii TAG2  broke out, plastic surgery provision was largely divided between the different services of the  TAG2 armed forces TAG2 , and gillies and his team were split up. gillies himself was sent to  TAG2 rooksdown house TAG2  near  TAG2 basingstoke TAG2 , which became the principal army plastic surgery unit; tommy kilner (who had worked with gillies during the first world war, and who now has a surgical instrument named after him, the kilner cheek retractor) went to queen mary's hospital, roehampton; and mowlem went to st albans. mcindoe, consultant to the raf, moved to the recently rebuilt  TAG2 queen victoria hospital TAG2  in  TAG2 east grinstead TAG2 ,  TAG2 sussex TAG2 , and founded a centre for plastic and jaw surgery. there, he treated very deep burn, and serious facial disfigurement, such as loss of eyelids, typical of those caused to aircrew by burning fuel. TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 citation needed TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 mcindoe is often recognized for not only developing new techniques for treating badly burned faces and hands but also for recognising the importance of the rehabilitation of the casualties and particularly of social reintegration back into normal life. he disposed of the &quot;convalescent uniforms&quot; and let the patients use their service uniforms instead. with the help of two friends, neville and elaine blond, he also convinced the locals to support the patients and invite them to their homes. mcindoe kept referring to them as &quot;his boys&quot; and the staff called him &quot;the boss&quot; or &quot;the maestro.&quot; TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 citation needed TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 his other important work included development of the  TAG2 walking-stalk skin graft TAG2 , and the discovery that immersion in  TAG2 saline TAG2  promoted healing as well as improving survival rates for victims with extensive burns — this was a serendipitous discovery drawn from observation of differential healing rates in pilots who had come down on land and in the sea. his radical, experimental treatments led to the formation of the  TAG2 guinea pig club TAG2  at  TAG2 queen victoria hospital TAG2 ,  TAG2 sussex TAG2 . among the better-known members of his &quot;club&quot; were  TAG2 richard hillary TAG2 ,  TAG2 bill foxley TAG2  and  TAG2 jimmy edwards TAG2 .

TAG2  TAG2 [18] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 burn surgery TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2 edit TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 burn surgery generally takes place in two phases. acute burn surgery is the treatment immediately after a burn. reconstructive burn surgery takes place after the burn wounds have healed. TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 craniofacial surgery TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 craniofacial surgery TAG2  is divided into pediatric and adult craniofacial surgery. pediatric craniofacial surgery mostly revolves around the treatment of congenital anomalies of the craniofacial skeleton and soft tissues, such as cleft lip and palate, craniosynostosis, and pediatric fractures. adult craniofacial surgery deals mostly with fractures and secondary surgeries (such as orbital reconstruction) along with orthognathic surgery. craniofacial surgery is an important part of all plastic surgery training programs, further training and subspecialisation is obtained via a craniofacial fellowship. craniofacial surgery is also practiced by  TAG2 maxillofacial surgeons TAG2 . TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 hand surgery TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 hand surgery TAG2  is concerned with acute injuries and chronic diseases of the hand and wrist, correction of congenital malformations of the upper extremities, and peripheral nerve problems (such as brachial plexus injuries or carpal tunnel syndrome). hand surgery is an important part of training in plastic surgery, as well as microsurgery, which is necessary to replant an amputated extremity. the hand surgery field is also practiced by  TAG2 orthopedic surgeons TAG2  and  TAG2 general surgeons TAG2 . scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand, causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough. there have been cases of surgery to women's hands in order to correct perceived flaws to create the perfect engagement ring photo. TAG2  TAG2 [19] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 microsurgery TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 microsurgery TAG2  is generally concerned with the reconstruction of missing tissues by transferring a piece of tissue to the reconstruction site and reconnecting blood vessels. popular subspecialty areas are breast reconstruction, head and neck reconstruction, hand surgery/replantation, and brachial plexus surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 pediatric plastic surgery TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2 edit TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 main article:  TAG2 pediatric plastic surgery TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 children often face medical issues very different from the experiences of an adult patient. many  TAG2 birth defects TAG2  or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood, and  TAG2 pediatric TAG2  plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children. conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include  TAG2 craniofacial anomalies TAG2 , syndactyly TAG2  TAG2 [20] TAG2  TAG2  (webbing of the fingers and toes), polydactyly (excess fingers and toes at birth), cleft lip and palate, and congenital hand deformities. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 techniques and procedures TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 [ TAG2  TAG2 edit TAG2  TAG2 ] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in plastic surgery, the transfer of skin tissue ( TAG2 skin grafting TAG2 ) is a very common procedure. skin grafts can be derived from the recipient or donors: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 autografts TAG2  are taken from the recipient. if absent or deficient of natural tissue, alternatives can be cultured sheets of  TAG2 epithelial cells TAG2  TAG2 in vitro TAG2  or synthetic compounds, such as integra, which consists of  TAG2 silicone TAG2  and bovine tendon collagen with glycosaminoglycans. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 allografts TAG2  are taken from a donor of the same species. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 xenografts TAG2  are taken from a donor of a different species. TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 usually, good results would be expected from plastic surgery that emphasize careful planning of incisions so that they fall within the line of natural skin folds or lines, appropriate choice of  TAG2 wound closure TAG2 , use of best available suture materials, and early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures.

TAG1  TAG1 the most common reconstructive procedures are tumor removal, laceration repair, maxillofacial surgery, scar revision, hand surgery and  TAG2 breast reduction plasty TAG2 . according to the american society of plastic surgeons, the number of reconstructive breast reductions for women decreased in 2018 by 4 percent from the year before. breast reduction in men decreased in 2018 by 8 percent. in 2018, there were 57,535 performed.

TAG2  TAG2 [35] TAG2  TAG2  there exists a correlation between sufferers of bdd and the predilection toward cosmetic plastic surgery in order to correct a perceived defect in their appearance. TAG2  TAG2 [36] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 bdd is a disorder resulting in the sufferer becoming &quot;preoccupied with what they regard as defects in their bodies or faces.&quot; alternatively, where there is a slight physical anomaly, then the person's concern is markedly excessive. TAG2  TAG2 [36] TAG2  TAG2  while 2% of people suffer from body dysmorphic disorder in the united states, 15% of patients seeing a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeons have the disorder. half of the patients with the disorder who have cosmetic surgery performed are not pleased with the aesthetic outcome. bdd can lead to suicide in some of its sufferers. while many with bdd seek cosmetic surgery, the procedures do not treat bdd, and can ultimately worsen the problem. the psychological root of the problem is usually unidentified; therefore causing the treatment to be even more difficult. some say that the fixation or obsession with correction of the area could be a sub-disorder such as anorexia or muscle dysmorphia. TAG2  TAG2 [37] TAG2  TAG2  the increased use of body and facial reshaping applications such as  TAG2 snapchat TAG2  and  TAG2 facetune TAG2  have been identified as a potential triggers of bdd. recently, a phenomenon referred to as 'snapchat dysmorphia' has appeared to describe people who request surgery to resemble the edited version of themselves as they appear through snapchat filters. TAG2  TAG2 [38] TAG2  TAG2  as a protest to the detrimental trend, instagram banned all augmented reality (ar) filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery. TAG2  TAG2 [39] TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in some cases, people whose physicians refuse to perform any further surgeries, have turned to &quot; TAG2 do it yourself TAG2 &quot; plastic surgery, injecting themselves and running extreme safety risks.

TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ TAG1  TAG1 women are no longer the only people having cosmetic surgery.  TAG2 men are contributing to the boom TAG2  in procedures. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  1. liposuction  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 there are two types of liposuction, a surgical procedure that suctions fat from specific areas of the body to provide a slimmer and shapelier silhouette. TAG1  TAG1 in tumescent liposuction, the most popular type, a solution of saline, a drug to constrict blood vessels and a numbing agent are infused into the area to be treated. TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ this liquid, along with fat, is suctioned out of the body using small hollow metal instruments called cannulas. the infusion of liquid can cause short-term fluid retention that diminishes over the next few days. TAG1  TAG1 in ultrasonic-assisted liposuction (ual), the cannula releases ultrasonic energy to melt fat so that it can be suctioned out of the body. TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ ual has more risks than tumescent liposuction, including the risk of internal and external burns and a lengthier surgery. TAG1  TAG1 the average patient is able to return to work within a few days, depending on the area(s) selected for the treatment.

TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ TAG1  TAG1 surgery is done for many reasons, to enlarge both breasts, to replace a breast that is absent or to make asymmetrical breasts equal in size. other women opt for surgery when their breasts do not develop during puberty, a condition called congenital micromastia. TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ TAG1  TAG1 silicone implants, once banned as a  TAG2 health risk TAG2 , are increasing in popularity. according to the american society of plastic surgeons, 12% of women opted for silicone implants in 2018. TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ TAG1  TAG1 most patients have one or two weeks of recovery before they can return to normal activities. high impact activity, such as running, may require additional healing time.

TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ TAG1  TAG1 lower eyelids with chronic puffiness or wrinkling are often reduced during the procedure for a more youthful appearance. fat pads under the eyes causing the appearance of “bags” are removed as necessary in the lower lid procedure. TAG1  TAG1 most people can go out in public in 10 to 14 days, with swelling becoming less noticeable for weeks or months.

TAG1  TAG1 this surgery is often performed on women who have excess skin after being pregnant or after losing significant weight after bariatric surgery. the ideal candidate does not have excess fat deposits in the abdomen to remove but too much skin hanging from the abdomen. TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ TAG1  TAG1 most patients are able to resume normal activities in two to three weeks but may have limits on physical activity for a longer period of time.

TAG1  TAG1 women with very heavy or overly large breasts often have difficulty finding clothing that fits, experience chronic back pain and poor posture. ideally, the surgery to reduce both the size and weight of the breasts will relieve back pain and improve posture.

TAG1  TAG1 in some cases where breathing is can be improved through surgery, as in the case of a deviated septum, insurance will pay for some or all of the surgery.

TAG1  TAG1 a facelift is frequently combined with another procedure, forehead lift, eyelid shaping or skin peels, to enhance the youthful appearance of the patient. TAG1  TAG1 sutures are often removed five to 10 days after the procedure, but recovery will take several weeks.

TAG1  TAG1 some women opt to have a lift and an implant procedure if the breasts are notably smaller than before weight loss or pregnancy. TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ TAG1  TAG1 most women are able to return to work within two weeks and resume full physical activity within a month. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 learn about the 5 most common breast lift techniques available TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  9. forehead lift  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 similar to a facelift, a forehead lift pulls the skin of the forehead tighter to remove wrinkles and smooth creases. this corrects drooping eyebrows, &quot;hooded&quot; eyelids, forehead furrows, and frown lines. TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ the eyebrows are also elevated for a more alert and youthful appearance. TAG1  TAG1 patients with deep furrows between the eyebrows also benefit from a forehead lift as the lines are minimized as the eyebrows are raised. TAG1  TAG1 most patients are able to resume normal activity within ten days of surgery, but recovery can be significantly longer if combined with other facial surgeries. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2  10. gynecomastia treatment  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 surgery to reduce excessive amounts of male breast tissue, a condition known as gynecomastia, is a permanent treatment for most men, as long as the increased amount of tissue is due to the person’s genetics. however, the majority of men don't require treatment  TAG2 ﻿ TAG2 ﻿ TAG1  TAG1 some men experience growth of their breasts after using steroids or marijuana habitually. for these men, breast size will increase if the use of the drug that caused the growth continues. it is essential that men who know that drugs are the cause of their gynecomastia stop using the drug prior to the surgery or the outcome may not be ideal. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 men with very large breasts may require a longer surgery with an additional procedure to decrease excess skin; otherwise sagging skin may be noticeable.

TAG1  TAG1  special knowledge and skill in the design and surgery of grafts, flaps, free  tissue transfer and replantation is necessary. competence in the management of  complex wounds, the use of implantable materials, and tumor surgery is  required. plastic surgery has been prominent in the development of innovative  techniques such as microvascular and cranio-maxillofacial surgery, liposuction,  and tissue transfer. the foundation of surgical anatomy, physiology, pathology,  and other basic sciences is fundamental to this specialty. TAG1  TAG1  competency in plastic surgery implies a special combination of basic  knowledge, surgical judgment, technical expertise, ethics, and interpersonal  skills in order to achieve satisfactory patient relationships and problem  resolution. TAG1  TAG1  training in the specialty of plastic surgery deals with the resection,  repair, replacement, and reconstruction of defects of form and function of the  integument and its underlying anatomic systems, including the craniofacial  structures, the oropharynx, the trunk, the extremities, the breast, and the  perineum. it includes aesthetic (cosmetic) surgery of structures with undesirable  form. special knowledge and skill in the design and transfer of flaps, in the  transplantation of tissues, and in the replantation of structures are vital to  these ends, as is skill in excisional surgery, in management of complex wounds,  and in the use of alloplastic materials. residency training in plastic surgery  is designed to educate and train physicians broadly in the art and science of  plastic and reconstructive surgery and to develop a competent and responsible  plastic surgeon with high moral and ethical character capable of functioning as  an independent surgeon. TAG1  TAG1  a variety of educational plans will produce the desired result. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 all prerequisite residency training  must be taken within programs accredited by the following organizations: the  accreditation council for graduate medical education (acgme), the royal college  of physicians and surgeons of canada, or the american dental association.  TAG2  TAG2 the curriculum for residency training  in plastic surgery is two years. a program may be accredited for more than two  years (such as in the integrated model or the independent model using a  three-year format) when it is demonstrated that there is a clear educational  rationale - consonant with the program requirements for residency education in  plastic surgery as set by the residency review committee for plastic  surgery - and the objectives for residency training cannot be met in a  two-year curriculum or when the program director has delineated a program with  special goals that exceed those goals defined in the program requirements.  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 training models: the residency review committee (rrc) for plastic surgery  recognizes two training models, independent and integrated.  TAG1  TAG1  a. independent model TAG1  TAG2  TAG1  in the independent model of training, residents complete two or three years  of concentrated plastic surgery training, with no less than 12 months of  senior/chief responsibility, after successful completion of one of the following  prerequisite curricula: TAG1  TAG1  a minimum of three years of clinical training with progressive  responsibility in the same program in general surgery. transitional year or  rotating internships may not be used to fulfill this requirement. TAG1  TAG2  TAG1  b. integrated model TAG1  TAG2  TAG1  in the integrated model, residents complete five or six years of  acgme-accredited plastic surgery training following receipt of an md or do  degree from an institution accredited by the liaison committee on medical  education (lcme) or the american osteopathic association (aoa). graduates of  schools of medicine from countries other than the united states or canada must  present evidence of final certification by the education commission for foreign  medical graduates (ecfmg). TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 the integrated curriculum must contain  no less than five or six years of surgical training under the authority and  direction of the plastic surgery program director.  TAG2  TAG2 of these five or six years, no less  than 24 months must be concentrated plastic surgery training with no less than  12 months of chief responsibility on the clinical service of plastic surgery.  residents must complete the last two years of their education in the same  plastic surgery program.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as of mid-march, both your personal and work life mostly take place online. during the first few days of working from home, you quickly discovered zoom’s “ TAG2 touch up my appearance TAG2 ” feature, a filter the video conferencing service describes as “a softening effect to skin to minimize the visibility of imperfections.” the filter diffuses your  TAG2 stress breakout TAG2 , but as your boss is discussing wfh logistics during a meeting, you can’t help but stare at your own neck and the deep-set smile lines that definitely weren’t as prominent yesterday. as the weeks go on, you swear you’ve developed crow’s feet in quarantine, too.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 with the country slowly opening back up after months of being shut down due to the  TAG2 coronavirus pandemic TAG2 , you can finally get filler and botox to firm and tighten the areas of your face that age you on zoom. that is, if you can get an appointment.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 post covid-19 lockdown, cosmetic dermatologists and plastic surgeons have been more in demand than ever, with some doctors booked up well into fall 2020. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “we’ve been so busy with surgical procedures, but there’s been the biggest uptick in non-surgical procedures,” says  TAG2 dr. sarmela sunder TAG2 , a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon in beverly hills. “everyone has been cooped up and staring at themselves on zoom or in the mirror. i thought after the first month or so things would die down, but i’m booked out longer than i have ever been previously.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 dr. sunder is currently taking appointments for mid-september.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 related: why having a proper skincare routine is extra important during the coronavirus pandemic TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 according to a survey conducted by the  TAG2 american society of plastic surgeons TAG2  on americans’ attitudes towards plastic surgery in the wake of covid-19, during the pandemic, 49% of respondents who haven’t had any plastic surgery say they are open to having cosmetic or reconstructive procedures in the future. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 dr. suneel chilukuri, a board-certified dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon in houston is in the process of expanding his staff at  TAG2 refresh dermatology TAG2  to keep up with the post-quarantine cosmetic facial procedure rush.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “i really thought there was going to be a significant slowdown with covid-19, because of people being scared to get procedures done and the high unemployment rate,” he says. “we even talked about the possibility of downsizing and providing payouts to the employees we couldn’t afford to keep. so, i’ve been quite surprised.”   TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the most popular post-lockdown non-surgical procedures are predictably from the neck up. of the most-requested treatments during telemedicine appointments, 65% were  TAG2 botulinum toxin type a fillers TAG2  such as botox, dysport, and xeomin, and 37% were  TAG2 soft tissue fillers TAG2  such as juvederm, radiesse, restylane, sculptra, and belotero, according to the  TAG2 asps TAG2 . what is surprising, however, is that in addition to requests for upper eyelid lifts, brow lifts, and non-surgical neck lifts, our experts say lip injections are as popular as ever, despite many states mandating that face masks be worn in public.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “i thought everyone was going to be obsessed with their eyes and not care about their lips and jaw line because we’re all under masks,” dr. sunder says. “while it’s true that people are noticing their eyes more, because everyone is on zoom, they are now noticing their jaw lines.”  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 she has seen a 100% increase in lower facelifts, neck lifts, and jawline tightening procedures compared to her practice's pre-pandemic appointments. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “back in february, we were seeing about 15 to 20 consults for lower facelifts, neck lifts, and jawline tightening procedures,” dr. sunder says. “post-quarantine, we are seeing double that number! in addition, the patients that are consulting about these procedures are eager to get these procedures as soon as possible.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 related: everything you need to know about getting facial fillers  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 dr. chilukuri points out that since everyone is wearing masks, it’s easier to cover up bruising or swelling from lip injections. “normally i tell people that for three days you might not be able to go to certain functions. now, patients say go ahead and do it because they have a mask on and can hide the bruising or swelling, he says. “they also have the excuse of turning off their camera on zoom. they’ll call in from their phone ‘this one time’ or say their camera isn’t working, so no one at work will see them.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 dr. jason emer TAG2 , a board-certified dermatologist in los angeles says many of his patients who are on long-term treatment plans were lined up to come back once his office reopened in june. “they know every two months they get a facial and laser treatment, every quarter there’s a bigger laser or a peel, and every six months or so there’s fillers and botox in-between,” he explains. “those three or so months went by, and [then] everyone came in for filler, botox, and laser.” dr. emer is not only busy touching up his regulars after quarantine. he’s booking appointments through the end of the year, specifically seeing an upswing of patients wanting these skin-tightening and wrinkle- and sagging-preventing treatments after the summer and ahead of the holiday season. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 before lockdown, people couldn’t see themselves while having face-to-face conversations with co-workers, family, or friends. it would be bizarre to whip out a mirror in a meeting to glare at your own face while your boss is talking next quarter’s strategy, and yet that’s how so many have been operating these last few months. not only is staring at your own face distracting from the task at hand, but experts say it can be triggering for anyone who already had self-esteem issues before the pandemic and intensify their desire to fix these “flaws” with cosmetic facial procedures. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 related: read this before getting botox TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “you see yourself the way others do, but you are also adopting an alienating perspective on yourself. when we do this, we start imagining all the judgments people could make on us, and our insecurities can manifest in what we say to ourselves,” explains  TAG2 dr. sanam hafeez TAG2 , a neuropsychologist and faculty member at columbia university. “one only has to look up phone camera comparisons to see how drastically different cameras on different phone models can make you look. for some, this is very uncomfortable, but for others, it's hard to look away.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 and data suggests we’re spending a lot of time over-analyzing what we see in our full-length mirrors, too. the  TAG2 asps TAG2  says that there has been continued interest in surgical procedures during the pandemic, but, notably, the top two most-requested procedures during telemedicine appointments were breast augmentation and liposuction. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 dr. melissa doft, a double board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon and founder of  TAG2 doft plastic surgery TAG2  in new york city says that in addition to pre-booking filler appointments while conducting telemedicine appointments during lockdown, she received a lot of requests for breast augmentation and reduction consultations.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “we’ve done a few breast reduction consults which i think is a great idea because we can do all of the measurements and photographs [from home],” dr. doft told  TAG2 instyle TAG2  in april. “then, i can do the video consultation while looking at the photographs to explain how the breast reduction is done, what the post-op situation will be, and then i can submit everything into their insurance because usually that takes a month to be approved. it gives us a head start because everything is delayed because of covid-19.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 related: are injections the secret to getting rid of dark circles for good QUESTION   TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 as people begin to return to an adapted version of their life pre-pandemic, beauty routines — including cosmetic procedures — satisfy both personal and societal needs. even though there’s still great uncertainty surrounding health and employment, people want to feel good about themselves and be respected and admired by their peers.  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 dr. hafeez points out there are both productivity and self-esteem benefits to looking one’s best. “i don’t mean to say you have to work from home in a gown, hair, and makeup, but looking presentable for yourself as well as for work wires us for a more productive day and one where everything isn’t such a chore,” she says. “some people might be relieved that they get to forgo these beauty routines to fit the ‘status quo,’ but some might really miss that. it's a very complicated but rationally validated coping mechanism.” TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 but these coping mechanisms come with risks. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 even though dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons are taking necessary steps to protect patients, themselves, and their office staff from covid-19 exposure, the possibility of transmission is still present, as states in a rush to open, like texas and florida, are seeing  TAG2 cases spike TAG2 .  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 “any procedure where you’re going to be face-to-face for longer than 15 minutes, there’s a risk,&quot; says  TAG2 dr. sandra kesh TAG2 , infectious disease specialist and deputy medical director at westmed medical group in new york city. &quot;[but] there are things that can be done to mitigate the risk.”  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","NOT"

TAG2  TAG2 miquel benitez/getty images TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 with stay-at-home orders leaving many bemoaning their webcam appearances, plastic surgeons have seen a rebound in demand for procedures with the reopening of their offices. TAG1  TAG1 “across the country there has been some pent-up demand,&quot; said american society of plastic surgeons president dr. lynn jeffers. &quot;our statistics show that people are still interested.” TAG1  TAG1 jeffers said breast augmentation and liposuction top the list of most common procedures, according to surveys of plastic surgeons' offices from across the country compiled by the american society of plastic surgeons. TAG1  TAG1 “even during this pandemic the interest in plastic surgery has not waned,&quot; she noted. TAG1  TAG1 millions of americans get botox injections and breast augmentations every year. following strict stay-at-home orders in march and april, many hospitals and doctors' office across the country have since resumed these elective procedures, particularly in places where infection rates are relatively stable. TAG1  TAG1 according to the american society of plastic surgeons, 55% of plastic surgeons across the country reported that botox injections were the most commonly sought treatment during the stay-at-home order, followed by 40% who reported that breast augmentation was the most frequent request. TAG1  TAG1 these expectations align with prior plastic surgery trends. botox injections and breast augmentations were the most common procedures in 2019 for nonsurgical and surgical categories, respectively. nearly 8 million botox injections and nearly 300,000 breast augmentations were performed last year. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 more: the heart: before, during and after covid-19 TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 dr. heather furnas, a plastic surgeon at plastic surgery associates in santa rosa, california, and an adjunct clinical professor of plastic surgery at stanford university, agrees. TAG1  TAG1 “it’s like there was this pent-up demand for surgery – breast augmentation, breast lifts, tummy tucks . . . demand is huge,&quot; she said. &quot;we filled up immediately.” TAG1  TAG1 furnas feels that stay-at-home orders may have contributed to this phenomenon. TAG1  TAG1 “some of them will say they see themselves on zoom and they just want to feel better,&quot; she explained. &quot;in this crazy time, i think people are looking for something to make them feel better about themselves.” TAG1  TAG1 but as patients grapple with the economic impact of the pandemic, jeffers predicts a higher proportion of patients will opt for less expensive and less invasive procedures initially. TAG1  TAG1 “bridging procedures like botox and fillers – patients will want things like that until they are more secure,” she said. TAG1  TAG1 and beyond cosmetic procedures, plastic surgeons are grateful to be able to resume other procedures as well, such as reconstructive plastic surgery for an injury or for breast or skin cancer. TAG1  TAG1 as the pandemic swept the nation and all elective procedures were canceled, plastic surgeons say the blurred lines between essential and nonessential surgeries led to many difficult decisions. TAG1  TAG1 “if somebody came in with something traumatic, it obviously had to be dealt with. the harder things were skin cancer, early breast cancers – at what point can you delay them and at what point must you move forward,” jeffers explained. TAG1  TAG1 these decisions were difficult because “no one knew how long this was going to last,&quot; she said. &quot;certain things can be put off for a month but they can’t be delayed for three or five.” TAG1  TAG1 many of these patients who had their cancer surgeries and reconstructions delayed are now part of a backlog that plastic surgeons like jeffers are trying to tackle. TAG1  TAG1 “we still don’t know the whole aftermath of that and how many people had certain amount of delayed care from a cancer perspective,” she said. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 more: fda expands list of potentially dangerous hand sanitizers TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 meanwhile, the pandemic has somewhat normalized remote medical visits, in which patients video conference with their doctors to talk about their medical concerns and see if they can be addressed remotely. TAG1  TAG1 now, many plastic surgeons hope that virtual medicine is here to stay because it might increase access to treatments among people who live in more remote areas. TAG1  TAG1 although telemedicine can help relieve some of the demand for in-person visits, there are certain procedures and consultations that must be done in person. plastic surgeons say they can be done safely by following cdc guidelines to prevent the spread of infection. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 what you should know if you want to visit a plastic surgeon TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 for those wishing to see a plastic surgeon in the near future, furnas said, “find out what their protocol is. they should be informing you in advance to come with a mask, that they will be taking your temperature, and they will be screening your symptoms.” TAG1  TAG1 the american society of plastic surgeons put out guidelines for plastic surgeons to get back to work safely and jeffers encouraged patients to ask their plastic surgeons about the safety procedures they have in place. TAG1  TAG1 furnas also said that not every patient will be a good candidate for elective surgery during a pandemic. TAG1  TAG1 “sometimes patients will push to do more than can safely be done,&quot; she said. &quot;we do really look at comorbidities and so occasionally we will tell somebody, 'why don’t we wait QUESTION ’” TAG1  TAG1 furnas and jeffers are both pleased to be providing patients with a source of happiness during these challenging times. TAG1  TAG1 “the best part of being a plastic surgeon is seeing the happiness of the patient afterwards ... seeing them smile in this time is just really, really gratifying,” furnas said.

TAG2  TAG2 © gchutka/istock.com TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 early developments in plastic surgery TAG1  TAG1 the modern definition of plastic surgery is rooted in ancient medicine. the sanskrit text  TAG2 sushruta-samhita TAG2 , written about 600  TAG2 bce TAG2  by ancient indian medical practitioner sushruta, describes, with surprising modernity, a quintessential plastic surgical procedure: the reconstruction of mutilated  TAG2 noses TAG2  using tissue bridged from the cheek. during the  TAG2 renaissance TAG2 , italian surgeon gaspare tagliacozzi and french surgeon  TAG2 ambroise paré TAG2  adopted these early procedures and kindled a modern fascination with the use of local and distant tissue to reconstruct complex wounds. in the 19th century german surgeon  TAG2 karl ferdinand von gräfe TAG2  first  TAG2 invoked TAG2  the term  TAG2 plastic TAG2  when describing creative reconstructions of the  TAG2 nose TAG2  in his text  TAG2 rhinoplastik TAG2  (1818). in the united states the organizing bodies of plastic surgery were founded between the world wars, with the american society of plastic surgeons established in 1931 and the american board of plastic surgery established in 1937. in the 1960s and ’70s the pioneering work of canadian-born american surgeon harry j. buncke, japanese surgeon susumu tamai, and austrian surgeon hanno millesi resulted in the  TAG2 integration TAG2  of procedures and techniques that defined  TAG2 microsurgery TAG2  (surgery on very small structures requiring the use of a  TAG2 microscope TAG2 ). TAG1  TAG1 aesthetic, or  TAG2 cosmetic TAG2 , surgery entered into the public  TAG2 consciousness TAG2  with the advent of refinements that rendered safe the rejuvenation of the face and body through procedures such as face-lifts, breast augmentation, and liposuction. this was coupled with an increasing emphasis on minimally invasive procedures, such as injections of botulinum toxin ( TAG2 botox TAG2 ) and cosmetic soft-tissue fillers (e.g.,  TAG2 collagen TAG2  and hyaluronic acid).

TAG2  TAG2 © comstock/thinkstock TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 surgical principles TAG1  TAG1 the basic  TAG2 premise TAG2  of soft tissue reconstruction is fixing deformities with normal tissue that shares similar characteristics with the damaged tissue. respect for tissue physiology and mechanics is important in both reconstructive and aesthetic plastic surgery. hence, delicate handling of tissue with instruments, judicious elevation of tissue to minimize vascular disruption, and precise alignment of tissue planes are all important elements of technique.

TAG2 subscribe today TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 grafts TAG2  and flaps TAG1  TAG1 closure of wounds is a central tenet of reconstructive surgery. many wounds can be closed primarily (with direct suture repair). however, if the defect is sufficiently large, skin may be taken from other parts of the body and transferred to the area of the wound.  TAG2 skin grafts TAG2  are thin layers of skin taken from a remote location that are secured to the site of repair with  TAG2 bolsters TAG2 , which serve to  TAG2 facilitate TAG2  eventual integration of the donor skin into the wound. TAG1  TAG1 larger, more complex wounds have a greater volume and can involve exposed vital structures, such as vessels, nerves,  TAG2 tendon TAG2 ,  TAG2 bone TAG2 , viscera, and other organs. such wounds require coverage via transposed or transplanted composite segments of skin, subcutaneous tissue,  TAG2 muscle TAG2 , and, in some cases, bone and nerve. these tissue constructs are maintained by their own defined blood supply and are called flaps. the pioneering work of australian plastic surgeon ian taylor led to the characterization of angiosomes—the networks of  TAG2 blood vessels TAG2  that supply flaps—which has allowed for rational matching of flaps to defects. flaps may be transferred from neighbouring tissue, or they may be disconnected from their original blood supply and reconnected using microsurgical technique to another set of vessels  TAG2 adjacent TAG2  to the defect. TAG1  TAG1 the use of implants or expander devices can also increase the amount of soft tissue. these devices are useful in cases when a patient has a limited amount of donor skin—for example, in those who are severely burned or in children who have large congenital  TAG2 moles TAG2 . implants and expander devices have also been adapted for breast reconstruction following  TAG2 mastectomy TAG2  in  TAG2 breast cancer TAG2  patients and for aesthetic breast augmentation.

TAG2  TAG2 © istockphoto/thinkstock TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 craniofacial surgery TAG1  TAG1 congenital and traumatic defects of the head and neck region fall under the scope of plastic surgery.  TAG2 cleft lip TAG2  and  TAG2 cleft palate TAG2  deformities, premature fusion of  TAG2 skull TAG2  elements, and persistent clefts in the facial skeleton require complex soft tissue and bone rearrangement. the introduction of internal fixation systems that use screws and plates has greatly  TAG2 facilitated TAG2  congenital reconstructions as well as correction of traumatic fractures. novel permutations of these fixation devices have been developed; for example, distraction osteogenesis is a technique used to induce bone growth from hypoplastic (incompletely developed) bone by traction exerted by moveable plate systems. biomaterials, such as absorbable plate systems and bone cements, are being improved continually and are often used in pediatric craniofacial surgery. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 hand TAG2  surgery TAG1  TAG1 by virtue of its unique anatomy and functional importance, restoration of  TAG2 hand TAG2  deformities is a shared focus of both plastic surgeons and orthopedic surgeons. congenital defects involving the hand range from absent or incomplete development (agenesis) to  TAG2 anomalies TAG2  of limb structures. traumatic insult may give rise to complex wounds,  TAG2 fractured bones TAG2 , severed nerves and tendons, or  TAG2 amputations TAG2 . in the appropriate  TAG2 context TAG2 , severed digits and limbs may be replanted with microsurgical connections of vessels and nerves. rehabilitation of the hand is a critical aspect of surgical care, since loss of strength and motion may occur following injury and reconstruction. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 aesthetic surgery TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 aesthetic, or cosmetic, surgery is the enhancement of normal structures that are subject to age-related changes or that have unusual features that are distressing to the patient. the procedures used to address these issues are often performed in the physician’s office (as opposed to a hospital) and are relatively simple, entailing only injections of botulinum toxin or hyaluronic soft-tissue filler. in some cases, however, these procedures are complex, involving elective surgery to correct deformities of the nose or to remove excess sagging skin on the face. the practice of plastic surgery has moved beyond plastic surgeons, and there are many other physicians, such as dermatologists and otolaryngologists, who have the skill to perform these procedures.

TAG2  TAG2 © subbotina anna/shutterstock.com TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 the same principles that govern reconstructive surgery are applied to aesthetic surgery: replace like with like, respect anatomic boundaries, minimize tissue trauma, and preserve vascular  TAG2 integrity TAG2 . aesthetic surgery is also concerned with scars, especially their length and visibility, and modifications to classic procedures such as face-lifts are made to minimize and hide scars. while age-related changes can weaken the support structures of skin and soft tissue, the advent of bariatric surgery in obese patients can create  TAG2 analogous TAG2  changes in the tissues of the arms, chest,  TAG2 abdomen TAG2 , and thighs. corresponding lifts of these parts of the body can be performed. TAG1  TAG1 other aesthetic surgeries can reduce or augment parts of the body that are perceived to be too large or too small; common examples include the nose or breasts. in addition, the judicious use of liposuction can improve  TAG2 contour TAG2  in areas that are unbalanced by excess  TAG2 fat TAG2 . for the face the use of botulinum toxin can weaken the underlying muscles that create some wrinkles; other wrinkles can be softened by injection of hyaluronic acid. chemical peels, dermabrasion, and lasers can be used to smooth the fine wrinkles that can form in the uppermost layers of skin.

TAG1  TAG2  TAG1 cosmetic surgery continues to grow in popularity, with  TAG2 15.1 million TAG2  cosmetic procedures carried out in the united states in 2013, an increase of 3 percent on the previous year. TAG1  TAG1 procedures are available for almost any part of the body, but the choice to undergo cosmetic surgery should not be taken lightly. the results are often permanent, so it is important to be sure about the decision, to use an appropriate practitioner, and to have the right motivation. TAG1  TAG1 a surgeon may refer a patient for counseling before surgery if they believe there is an underlying problem that cannot be solved by the surgery, or if the patient shows signs of body dysmorphic disorder (bdd). TAG1  TAG1 bdd can  TAG2 cause a person to perceive TAG2  that there is something seriously wrong with their appearance, when objective evidence suggests otherwise. TAG1  TAG1 reconstructive surgery is another type of plastic surgery. it aims to improve function and to give a normal appearance to a part of the person’s body that has been damaged, for example, after a  TAG2 mastectomy TAG2 . this article will focus on cosmetic surgery only. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 a variety of aesthetic procedures is available for different parts of the body. TAG1  TAG1 breast surgery TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 breast implants can be used to increase breast size or in reconstruction after surgery. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 women may seek breast surgery to improve their body shape. mammoplasty procedures may include: TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 breast augmentation, or enlargement TAG2 , traditionally performed using saline or silicone gel prosthetics, and now occasionally with fat grafting. TAG1  TAG1 it may be carried out if the woman feels her breasts are too small, if one breast is larger than the other, or if the breasts have changed after pregnancy or breastfeeding. some older women opt for this treatment when the breasts being to droop due to the skin losing elasticity. TAG1  TAG1 in some women, a breast enlargement can boost self-esteem and improve their feelings about their sexuality. in some, however, existing problems remain. this is why women are  TAG2 encouraged to undergo counseling TAG2  first. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 breast reduction TAG2  can help provide relief from physical discomfort, while the aim of augmentation more often relates to appearance. breast reduction  TAG2 may also reduce TAG2  the risk of  TAG2 breast cancer TAG2  in women who are at high risk of the disease. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 mastopexy, or a breast lift TAG2 , involves removing skin and glandular tissue to make the breasts smaller and rearranging the remaining tissue to make the breast appear lifted. TAG1  TAG1 depending on how much volume a patient has lost or desires, mastopexy can be combined with an implant. while it is similar to a breast reduction, which removes a much greater amount of tissue, mastopexy is not usually covered by major insurance carriers as it is not deemed medically necessary. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 male breast reduction TAG2  treats gynecomastia, an enlargement of the mammary tissue in men. it may be done by liposuction or with various scar patterns, often hidden around the nipple and areola. TAG1  TAG1 liposuction TAG1  TAG1 liposuction, or suction-assisted lipectomy, uses thin cannulas, or hollow metal tubes, to vacuum fat from various parts of the body, usually the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, hips, backs of the arms, and neck. liposuction may also be used for male breast reduction. TAG1  TAG1 tools used in liposuction include standard,  TAG2 ultrasound TAG2 , mechanical, and laser devices. they all tend to involve suction of fat through a tube. TAG1  TAG1 to prevent complications, there is a limit to the amount of fat that the surgeon can safely remove, depending on whether the patient will be discharged immediately after surgery or admitted to the hospital. TAG1  TAG1 liposuction should not be intended as a weight-loss procedure. when performed in the right patient, the goal is to improve contour and decrease limited areas of fat deposits. TAG1  TAG1 complications are rare but possible. they include the accumulation of blood under the skin, known as hematoma, infection, changes in sensation, allergic reactions, damage to underyling structures, and unsatisfactory results. the doctor must discuss these with the patient beforehand. TAG1  TAG1 liposuction  TAG2 does not reduce the risk TAG2  of developing  TAG2 diabetes TAG2 ,  TAG2 heart disease TAG2 , or  TAG2 high blood pressure TAG2 . TAG1  TAG1 vulvovaginal surgery TAG1  TAG1 labiaplasty, labioplasty, labia minor reduction, or labial reduction involves surgery of the labia majora or labia minora of the vulva, a part of the female genitalia. it aims to reduce elongated labia, usually as part of a vaginoplasty. TAG1  TAG1 there is a  TAG2 lack of clinical or scientific evidence TAG2  to guide gynecological surgeons as to the safety and effectiveness of cosmetic vaginal procedures. TAG1  TAG1 body procedures TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 abdominoplasty, or “tummy tuck” TAG2  reshapes and firms the abdomen. excess skin and fat is removed from the middle and lower abdomen, with the aim of tightening the muscle and fascia of the abdominal wall. TAG1  TAG1 this may be suitable after pregnancy or after losing a great deal of weight. TAG1  TAG1 other body contouring procedures TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 buttock augmentation TAG2  enhances the appearance of the buttocks by making them larger. the surgeon will either graft fat from another part of the patient’s body using liposuction. this is known as the “brazilian butt lift.” silicone implants may also occasionally be used in the buttocks. TAG1  TAG1 a  TAG2 buttock lift, or lower body lift TAG2  involves removing excess skin from the hips, buttocks, and thighs in order to tighten and lift them. these procedures are often combined with abdominoplasty in patients who have lost a considerable amount of weight after bariatric, or weight loss, surgery, for example. TAG1  TAG1 facial cosmetic surgery TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 blepharoplasty, or eyelid surgery TAG2 , aims to reshape the eyelids. with age, the skin becomes lax, and there may be drooping or hooding of the upper lids, and bags on the lower lids. eyelid surgery may be functional, cosmetic, or both. it usually involves removing or repositioning excess skin and fat, and the procedure may reinforce surrounding muscles and tendons. TAG1  TAG1 surgery can change the shape of the face or tighten the skin. TAG1  TAG1 in  TAG2 rhinoplasty TAG2 , also known as a “nose job,” the surgeon reshapes the patient’s nose to improve the appearance and often breathing, too. it may involve reshaping the tip and reducing the bony hump at the upper aspect of the nose. TAG1  TAG1 it can be performed with small incisions that are well hidden, often inside the nostrils. surgeons do not recommend rhinoplasty until the patient is at least 15 years old, to allow for full growth of the cartilage and bone of the nose. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 otoplasty TAG2 , or ear surgery, treats prominent or misshapen ears by surgically “pinning” the ear closer to the head with sutures, reshaping the cartilage, or both. TAG1  TAG1 one or both ears may be treated. it is most commonly performed in children after of 5 or 6 years as the ears have essentially reached adult size by that age. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 rhytidectomy TAG2 , also known as a  TAG2 facelift TAG2 , aims to surgically remove wrinkles and tighten facial skin in order to achieve a more youthful appearance. TAG1  TAG1 typically, the incision is placed in front of and behind the ears, extending into the hairline in the temple area. the skin is lifted off the deeper facial tissue, redraped more tightly, and the excess skin is removed. the incisions are then closed with sutures. TAG1  TAG1 the deeper tissues of the face and neck may also be tightened. blepharoplasty, or eyelid surgery may be done at the same time. TAG1  TAG1 a  TAG2 brow lift TAG2 , browplasty, or forehead lift aims to remove signs of aging by raising drooping eyebrows and removing forehead wrinkles, or worry lines. it is often done alongside other cosmetic procedures to achieve a more harmonious facial appearance. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 chin augmentation TAG2  aims to make the chin more prominent and provide a better balance of facial features. it may be done at the same time as rhinoplasty, depending on the measurements taken before surgery. it can be performed with either a prosthetic implant or through manipulation of the chin bone. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 malar, or cheek, augmentation TAG2  can make the cheekbones more prominent. the surgeon may place an implant at the top of the cheekbones. TAG1  TAG1 peels, fillers, grafts, and laser treatment TAG1  TAG1 less invasive treatments may include peels, fillers, injections, grafting, and laser treatment. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 share on pinterest TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 fillers can be used to iron out wrinkles and to make the lips look plumper. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 chemical peels TAG2  may help treat  TAG2 acne TAG2 , pock marks, scars, or wrinkles. a number of active agents may be used. TAG1  TAG1 a light or superficial peel uses alpha hydroxy acids (ahas) such as glycolic, lactic, or fruit acids to treat the outermost layers of the skin. the treatment is not as deep as with some peels, so the recovery time is minimal. TAG1  TAG1 a medium peel usually involves tca (tri-chloroacetic acid) of various concentrations. it penetrates the dermis, or deep layer of the skin, to a greater depth than the light peels. the recovery and pain are more significant than the lighter peels. redness and flaking may persist for several days or weeks. TAG1  TAG1 a deep peel, or phenol peel, penetrates the skin to the deepest extent. as a result, it has the  TAG2 greatest impact TAG2  on resurfacing the skin, but it also has the longest recovery time, and it can causing scarring and skin lightening. TAG1  TAG1 chemical peels have been shown to be  TAG2 safe and effective TAG2  for both light and darker skin types. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 botulinum toxin, or botox TAG2 , is the brand name of a toxin produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum (c. botulinum), first approved by the fda in the 1980s for muscle spasm. TAG1  TAG1 a range of cosmetic surgery procedures aim to improve appearance. TAG1  TAG1 it is used to treat wrinkles and facial creases. TAG1  TAG1 it acts by blocking the signal from nerves to the muscles that are injected. the injected muscle can no longer contract, or tighten, as forcefully as before, and this leads to a controlled relaxation of the muscles. TAG1  TAG1 it is approved for treatment of frown lines on the forehead, crow’s feet, or lines around the eye, and axillary  TAG2 hyperhidrosis TAG2 , or increased sweating of the armpits. TAG1  TAG1 apart from “ TAG2 botox TAG2 ,” several other brand names of botulinum toxin are now commercially available. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 soft tissue fillers TAG2 , or dermal fillers, are medical device implants approved by the fda for use in helping to create a smoother, fuller appearance in the face. TAG1  TAG1 they can be used to treat nasolabial folds, cheeks, and lips, and to increase the volume of the back of the hand. TAG1  TAG1 they can also reduce wrinkles, lines and scars, and augment soft tissue contours. they are not permanent, but they are degraded by the body, so repeat treatments may be necessary to maintain the effect. TAG1  TAG1 commercially available products include hyaluronic acid, poly-l-lactic acid (plla),  TAG2 calcium TAG2  hydroxyapetite, and polymethylmethacrylate beads (pmma). TAG1  TAG1 these products normally come in a gel formulation that fine needles can inject into the deeper layers of the skin and underlying soft tissue of the face.  TAG2 collagen TAG2  injections are no longer performed because some patients experienced allergic reactions, some of them serious. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 complications  TAG2 can occur TAG2  with facial fillers, and especially permanent fillers. clinicians and patients are urged to check the contents of a filler and discuss all the implications of surgery before going ahead with a procedure. TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 in 2015, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda)  TAG2 warned that TAG2  rare but serious problems may arise if soft tissue fillers are accidentally injected into blood vessels in the face. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 fat injections and fat grafting TAG2  have broad applications in cosmetic surgery. TAG1  TAG1 the patient’s own fat is collected from one part of the body using liposuction, and it is injected into areas requiring volume enhancement. it is usually applied to the face, including the lips, the hands, and depressions in skin contour. TAG1  TAG1 the results are generally safe and long lasting, and it can have the additional benefit of removing fat from a place where it is not wanted. the fat is removed, washed, and purified and then carefully re-injected with specially designed needles. sometimes the procedure needs to be repeated several times for best results. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 stem-cell enriched fat grafts TAG2  have been trialed for reconstructive surgery, with promising results, suggesting that the procedure is reliable, safe, and effective. however,  TAG2 tumor TAG2  growth  TAG2 may be an adverse effect TAG2 , so further research is needed before  TAG2 stem cells TAG2  can become central to plastic and reconstructive surgery. TAG1  TAG1  TAG2 lasers and light-based facial treatment TAG2 , also known as facial laser resurfacing or laser skin treatment, can help reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and abnormal pigmentation, such as sunspots. treatment utilizes concentrated, pulsating beams of light. TAG1  TAG1 a variety of laser types are used, and these vary in aggressiveness and downtime. it  TAG2 may take several sessions TAG2  to see results. TAG1  TAG1 hair transplantation TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 155757 TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2 hair transplantation is a kind of cosmetic surgery. TAG2  can help renew hair growth. TAG1  TAG1 tiny hair follicle grafts are obtained from the back of the scalp, where hair tends to be denser. it is then transplanted with minute incisions to the areas of the scalp that are affected by hair loss. TAG1  TAG1 patients may need several sessions to achieve the desired results. after 6 weeks, the transplanted hair will fall out, but about 3 months later, new hair will appear. TAG1  TAG1 anyone who is considering cosmetic surgery should stop smoking or using any tobacco products several months prior to any procedures, as they can interfere with wound healing. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 choosing a surgeon TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 it is important to choose a surgeon who is qualified and accredited by a professional board, such as the american board of plastic surgery. TAG1  TAG1 medical spas offer various services, but there is a lack of regulation regarding their practice. no organization sets standards for medical spas, and there is no recognized definition of what constitutes a medical spa. TAG1  TAG1 cosmetic surgery and mental health issues TAG1  TAG1 research suggests that people who undergo cosmetic surgery are also more likely to experience psychological issues, such as  TAG2 depression TAG2  and  TAG2 body dysmorphic disorder TAG2  (bdd). TAG1  TAG1 one  TAG2 study found that TAG2  women who had breast augmentation also had a higher risk of suicide. doctors are asked to be aware of this possibility when assessing patients for surgery. TAG1  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1 people who are considering cosmetic surgery need to weigh up the options carefully before going ahead. TAG1  TAG1 here are some tips: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 choose a reputable surgeon and checking their credentials. TAG2  TAG2 after obtaining the surgeon’s opinion, make your own decisions, and resist being persuaded to opt for something you did not previously want. TAG2  TAG2 get full information about the procedure and weigh up all the pros and cons beforehand. TAG2  TAG2 be aware of any risks and limitations, for example, will this need redoing in 6 months QUESTION  TAG2  TAG2 choose the right moment, avoiding, for example, the time around a stressful event, such as changing jobs, bereavement, having a baby, or moving house. TAG2  TAG2 never seek cosmetic surgery to please or impress anyone else. TAG2  TAG2 do not travel too far for treatment, or if travel is necessary, ensure the arrangements are reliable, especially if opting for surgery abroad. TAG2  TAG2 beware of non-refundable deposits, and be prepared to change your mind. TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 complications TAG2  TAG2  TAG1  TAG1 any surgery has a risk of complications. TAG1  TAG1 the american society of plastic surgeons  TAG2 urges people TAG2  to seek medical attention at once if they notice any of the following symptoms during or shortly after surgery: TAG1  TAG2  TAG2 unusual pain TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2  TAG2 ","NOT"
