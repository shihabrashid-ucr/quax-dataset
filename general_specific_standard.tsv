Our crew is there to serve you and not deceive you in any way. We're also here to help so please share your flight details via DMs.	specific
st and foremost - your crew has been lying to us for over an hour. Then after being deceived by your crew for over an hour - we are being lied to again as they advised us the new plane we are transferring to is departing at :45pm - however they have not begun boarding yet.	specific
"Not only has my family, and several other families been inconvenienced by today - this is now flights in one year with only ""on time"" departures."	specific

But - that's really not the issue. The issue is habitually inconveniences its customer base and displays a demeanor that its a normal practice in the airlines industry with no above and beyond accommodations offered to its inconvenienced and unsatisfied customers !	specific
I have flown times in the past months and only departed on schedule times.	specific
After hour of being lied to by the pilot - we are now being totally inconvenienced by having to un-board this plane and board another plane - meanwhile i should be landing in Miami in minutes. Completely irresponsible and utmost negligent on Pilots behalf	specific
We're sorry for the delay. The previous pilot may not have been aware of the problem. We appreciate your patience.	specific
"stuck on flight in Charlotte over minutes due to a computer card tech issue while pilot repeatedly advised it would only take a ""few minutes"" to fix. Why wasn't this issue reported by previous pilot that arrived minutes b4 we boarded in effort to save time?"	specific

So I assume nothing is coming from tho incident. It has been several days since we made a complaint at the desk in person after the flight and this tweet. Pretty much you blew off any concernnto a act of battery on the plane against a child. This is ridiculous!!!	specific

Hey, you can try using this guide to help . Have you tried using Blu Rays and if so, do they give you any issues? ^RM	specific
Thanks RM. BluRays play fine. These DVDs also play fine on original XB1 and other devices. The discs aren‚Äôt dirty. Here‚Äôs a video. My guess is the XB1X isn‚Äôt handling some form of macrovision correctly.	specific
Thank you for that, that is odd. Here is another guide that may provide some support with the issue you are seeing. ^RM	specific
I will try, but to be clear, it is _only_ the BluRay app doing this. Games and other activities on the XB1X are fine. I've also noticed the audio is out of sync with the picture when using the BluRay app - again, only this app - not Forza or anything else.	specific
Were you able to work through the steps we sent? Did they help with what you are seeing? ^BL	specific
I did. No, they did not. I also deleted and reinstalled the app. I don‚Äôt believe it is a TV or video output issue in general as all the games are fine. It is only the BluRay player app which does this. I think the app is not handling macrovision or something.	specific
a photo of your K stats on the console and your video settings including color space? ^JL	specific
Though the PS4Pro is not - for the same reason as with XB1X, it is connected to the TV for K output ...	specific
Thanks for that info. Let's change the color space to PC RGB and then change TV resolution to automatic or p if that is possible. ^JL	specific
Hi JL, why thank you! I am not given an 'automatic' resolution option, unfortunately, but I set it to PC RGB and it works! The DVDs play back fine now, even with resolution still on K. Thank you kindly! What a champ. What is 'colour space' out of interest?	specific
This is an article elaining color space. ^RM	specific
Terrific, thank you !	specific
To be sure, are you using a receiver with the TV and console? Can you send us ^JL	specific
Hello, on my new XB1X many DVDs play horribly - audio and video goes on and off, unwatchable. Yet all else works fine, and the DVDs played fine on original XB1 + also PS4Pro. Any ideas? BluRay player bug?	specific

When the Priority App is updated permissions change, you can turn them off in Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Priority App.	specific
Neither of those permissions can be disabled. Also, 'permissions change when updated' doesn't elain why the permissions are needed.	specific
For full and optimum use of the App these permissions are recommended. If you're unhappy you can disable them as above	specific
But why? They weren't before. Also, no, those particular permissions can not be disabled.	specific
So just to clarify what phone were you using before this one?	specific
I see this on both my OnePlus and my LG Nexus . Both are running Android . Though Android permissions aren't device specific.	specific
If the permissions cannot be disabled, they must be required to run the Priority app as efficiently as possible	specific
Again though, why? They weren't in the previous version and there's nothing in the what's new section that correlates to the new permissions	specific
Can you please follow us Jack, so we can send you some info?	specific
Ok, following.	specific
Thanks Jack We've sent you a DM now	specific
It shouldn't take over a week to give a justification for an app permission. That information should be in the app description.	specific

If a buyer has a negative feedback for not paying it's not going to stop them from bidding on your item. If you set up buyer requirements correctly you can restrict them from bidding if they've had an unpaid item case: . ^BC	specific
So maybe they‚Äôre restricted in the future, maybe not? And as a seller I have no idea how reliable a buyer is? Yea that‚Äôs a horrible setup.	specific
I appreciate it is frustrating but leaving a negative feedback won't stop them from doing it again. If you open an unpaid item case they will receive a strike for non payment which can lead to restrictions from bidding in future. ^BC	specific

because ultimately the only person who gets stung here is the customer. You keep the profit. Return the tax &amp; resell seats	specific

Plus - the flight I waned wasn't even running on the day I needed. Your site defaulted to the next available flight. Two months later!!!	specific
If your ticket was a non-refundable ticket, you would only be refunded unused taxes, Gellan. We do offer a hour cooling off period. /2	specific
/2 product twice - at worst illegal. Unethical at best. Impossible most of the times. months?!?! A decision. Not policy.	specific
No. Your policy is determined by what's the minimum you can get away with - I booked the wrong dates by accident... in an emergency. Fair?	specific
Hi Gellan, the cancellation policy is determined by the fare rules on the ticket that you purchase. We're sorry for any disappointment. ^H	specific

I didn't lmfao	specific
LMFAO hahaha!!	specific
my evangelist Lyft driver is taking me to get weed	specific
You asked what I meant by passenger loadings and so I listed some of the many reasons as to why trains may take a little longer at stations. I'd like you to contact us through one of our official contact methods should you need further info	specific
I asked you to elain the delay, not the definition. Could you now let me know why no announcement or apology was made at he station?	specific
You mentioned wheelchairs not me. You haven't responded to elain the lack of update or apology for the delayed service either yet	specific
No John, as I have said, I can't - as far as I can see the delay is due to passenger loadings-a busy service, slower boarding times (not just wheelchairs as you are suggesting) should you wish to complain our contact details are on the website thanks again!	specific
Could you please elain why the train lost a minute at most stops between BSW and Kid? A wheelchair at each one?	specific
The previous working to the train you were on picked up minutes delay - should you be interested in exactly what points during that journey the delays happened you can see on this webpage, I do not have any further specific info for you	specific
What, a wheelchair at every stop?	specific
It wasnt at one station it was along the way.	specific
Thanks, which one caused the delay on this occasion? minutes seems a long time to get a wheelchair or a pushchair onto a train	specific
Yep, we do. Sometimes it will take longer. Sometimes there may be more passengers meaning longer to board, there may be pushchairs, wheelchairs, other customers who require passenger assistance to board the train. We cannot account for every eventuality	specific
Thanks. Could you elain the passenger loading delay though? Do you not allow for passengers to board within your timetable?	specific
The previous service to the late KID was :08 from Leamington, this had a min delay by the end of service at Kiddy - due to passenger loadings along its journey. This impacted the next service from Kidderminster.	specific
Is there an update yet?	specific

How would they know why you are directing people to The Works?	specific
The latest information we have regarding an item's availability will be reflected on our website. ^BM	specific
Except that isn't the case. Why not? Why are you sending people to The Works? Why is that book in Home &amp; KItchen? What do you suggest I say to Bonnier when I call their switchboard as you suggest, to find out what Amazon is up to? What is the point of having Prime?	specific
Hi, you will need to speak with the publishers about this,as ^BM said the latest info we have is reflected on the website^AS.	specific
Are you actually reading my replies? The latest info is NOT on your website. Are you telling me to contact the pubisher as an author or an Amazon customer? Even if you are incompetent answering everything else, how about the Prime question?	specific

You don't need account access. Look up 'Please, let me go' Caitlin Spencer. It's listed under Home &amp; Kitchen. The rankings are in that category and it's not doing too well against kettles despite being a Sunday Times Top bestseller. You're only selling through rd parties.	specific

Why would I?	specific
Also, the one I linked to - when I searched, it came up in 'home and kitchen'!	specific
The other one has actually just changed to being in stock but it hasn't been on Prime for days as I was trying to get it.	specific
Is there a problem with books in the last couple of days? Been trying to buy one that is a bestseller but you say only third parties offer it which is odd. Similarly, the link for a book I ghosted - also a bestseller at the moment - says rd party only.	specific

Constipation in children is a common problem.	general
A constipated child has infrequent bowel movements or hard, dry stools.	general
Common causes include early toilet training and changes in diet.	general
Fortunately, most cases of constipation in children are temporary.	general
Encouraging your child to make simple dietary changes ‚Äî such as eating more fiber-rich fruits and vegetables and drinking more water ‚Äî can go a long way toward alleviating constipation.	general
If your child's doctor approves, it may be possible to treat a child's constipation with laxatives.	general
Less than three bowel movements a week Bowel movements that are hard, dry and difficult to pass Pain while having a bowel movement Stomach pain Traces of liquid or pasty stool in your child's underwear ‚Äî a sign that stool is backed up in the rectum Blood on the surface of hard stool If your child fears that having a bowel movement will hurt, he or she may try to avoid it.	general
You may notice your child crossing his or her legs, clenching his or her buttocks, twisting his or her body, or making faces when attempting to hold stool.	general
When to see a doctor Constipation in children usually isn't serious.	general
However, chronic constipation may lead to complications or signal an underlying condition.	general
Take your child to a doctor if the constipation lasts longer than two weeks or is accompanied by: Pain during bowel movements Part of the intestine coming out of the anus (rectal prolapse) Constipation most commonly occurs when waste or stool moves too slowly through the digestive tract, causing the stool to become hard and dry.	general
Many factors can contribute to constipation in children, including: Your child may ignore the urge to have a bowel movement because he or she is afraid of the toilet or doesn't want to take a break from play.	general
Some children withhold when they're away from home because they're uncomfortable using public toilets.	general
Withholding.	general
Painful bowel movements caused by large, hard stools also may lead to withholding.	general
If it hurts to poop, your child may try to avoid a repeat of the distressing experience.	general
If you begin toilet training too soon, your child may rebel and hold in stool.	general
If toilet training becomes a battle of wills, a voluntary decision to ignore the urge to poop can quickly become an involuntary habit that's tough to change.	general
Toilet training issues.	general
Not enough fiber-rich fruits and vegetables or fluid in your child's diet may cause constipation.	general
One of the more common times for children to become constipated is when they're switching from an all-liquid diet to one that includes solid foods.	general
Changes in diet.	general
Any changes in your child's routine ‚Äî such as travel, hot weather or stress ‚Äî can affect bowel function.	general
Children are also more likely to experience constipation when they first start school outside of the home.	general
Changes in routine.	general
Certain antidepressants and various other drugs can contribute to constipation.	general
Medications.	general
An allergy to cow's milk or consuming too many dairy products (cheese and cow's milk) sometimes leads to constipation.	general
Cow's milk allergy.	general
Children who have family members who have experienced constipation are more likely to develop constipation.	general
This may be due to shared genetic or environmental factors.	general
Family history.	general
Rarely, constipation in children indicates an anatomic malformation, a metabolic or digestive system problem, or another underlying condition.	general
Medical conditions.	general
Risk factors Constipation in children is more likely to affect kids who: Are sedentary Have a medical condition affecting the anus or rectum Have a neurological disorder Although constipation in children can be uncomfortable, it usually isn't serious.	general
If constipation becomes chronic, however, complications may include: Painful breaks in the skin around the anus (anal fissures) Rectal prolapse, when the rectum comes out of the anus Stool withholding Avoiding bowel movements because of pain, which causes impacted stool to collect in the colon and rectum and leak out (encopresis) To help prevent constipation in children: A diet rich in fiber can help your child's body form soft, bulky stool.	general
Serve your child more high-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole-grain cereals and breads.	general
If your child isn't used to a high-fiber diet, start by adding just several grams of fiber a day to prevent gas and bloating.	general
Offer your child high-fiber foods.	general
The recommended intake for dietary fiber is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories in your child's diet.	general
For younger children, this translates to an intake of about 20 grams of dietary fiber a day.	general
For adolescent girls and young women, it's 29 grams a day.	general
And for adolescent boys and young men, it's 38 grams a day.	general
Water is often the best.	general
Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids.	general
Regular physical activity helps stimulate normal bowel function.	general
Promote physical activity.	general
Regularly set aside time after meals for your child to use the toilet.	general
If necessary, provide a footstool so that your child is comfortable sitting on the toilet and has enough leverage to release a stool.	general
Create a toilet routine.	general
Some children get so wrapped up in play that they ignore the urge to have a bowel movement.	general
If such delays occur often, they can contribute to constipation.	general
Remind your child to heed nature's call.	general
Reward your child's efforts, not results.	general
Give children small rewards for trying to move their bowels.	general
Possible rewards include stickers or a special book or game that's only available after (or possibly during) toilet time.	general
And don't punish a child who has soiled his or her underwear.	general
Be supportive.	general
If your child is taking a medication that causes constipation, ask his or her doctor about other options.	general
Review medications.	general
Contact dermatitis on the wrist Contact dermatitis on the wrist Contact dermatitis can appear as an itchy, red rash.	general
In this photo, the irritation is likely due to a watchband or to soap residue trapped beneath the band.	general
Contact dermatitis is a red, itchy rash caused by direct contact with a substance or an allergic reaction to it.	general
The rash isn't contagious or life-threatening, but it can be very uncomfortable.	general
Many substances can cause such reactions, including soaps, cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry and plants.	general
To treat contact dermatitis successfully, you need to identify and avoid the cause of your reaction.	general
If you can avoid the offending substance, the rash usually clears up in two to four weeks.	general
You can try soothing your skin with cool, wet compresses, anti-itch creams and other self-care steps.	general
Contact dermatitis on the face Contact dermatitis on the face Contact dermatitis usually affects areas of skin directly exposed to an offending substance.	general
Here, the dry, red rash is likely caused by cosmetics or soap.	general
Poison ivy blisters Poison ivy blisters Blisters such as these are common in a skin reaction to urushiol, the highly allergenic oily substance in poison ivy.	general
Contact dermatitis usually occurs on areas of your body that have been directly exposed to the reaction-causing substance ‚Äî for example, along a calf that brushed against poison ivy or under a watchband.	general
The rash usually develops within minutes to hours of exposure and can last two to four weeks.	general
Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis include: Dry, cracked, scaly skin Swelling, burning or tenderness See your doctor if: The rash is so uncomfortable that you are losing sleep or are distracted from your daily activities The rash is sudden, painful, severe or widespread You're embarrassed by the way your skin looks The rash doesn't get better within three weeks The rash affects your face or genitals in the following situations: Seek immediate medical care You think your skin is infected.	general
Clues include fever and pus oozing from blisters.	general
Your lungs, eyes or nasal passages are painful and inflamed, perhaps from inhaling an allergen.	general
You think the rash has damaged the mucous lining of your mouth and digestive tract.	general
Contact dermatitis is caused by a substance you're exposed to that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction.	general
The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants.	general
Some of these substances may cause both irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis.	general
is the most common type.	general
This nonallergic skin reaction occurs when a substance damages your skin's outer protective layer.	general
Irritant contact dermatitis Some people react to strong irritants after a single exposure.	general
Others may develop signs and symptoms after repeated exposures to even mild irritants.	general
And some people develop a tolerance to the substance over time.	general
Common irritants include: Fertilizers and pesticides occurs when a substance to which you're sensitive (allergen) triggers an immune reaction in your skin.	general
It usually affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen.	general
But it may be triggered by something that enters your body through foods, flavorings, medicine, or medical or dental procedures (systemic contact dermatitis).	general
Allergic contact dermatitis You may become sensitized to a strong allergen such as poison ivy after a single exposure.	general
Weaker allergens may require multiple exposures over several years to trigger an allergy.	general
Once you develop an allergy to a substance, even a small amount of it can cause a reaction.	general
Common allergens include: Nickel, which is used in jewelry, buckles and many other items Medications, such as antibiotic creams and oral antihistamines Balsam of Peru, which is used in many products, such as perfumes, cosmetics, mouth rinses and flavorings Formaldehyde, which is in preservatives, disinfectants and clothing Personal care products, such as deodorants, body washes, hair dyes, cosmetics and nail polish Plants such as poison ivy and mango, which contain a highly allergenic substance called urushiol Airborne substances, such as ragweed pollen and spray insecticides Products that cause a reaction when you're in the sun (photoallergic contact dermatitis), such as some sunscreens and oral medications Children develop the condition from the usual offenders and also from exposure to diapers, baby wipes, sunscreens, clothing with snaps or dyes, and so on.	general
More Information Risk factors Some jobs and hobbies put you at higher risk of contact dermatitis.	general
Examples include: Health care and dental employees Metalworkers Auto mechanics Scuba divers or swimmers, due to the rubber in face masks or goggles Complications Contact dermatitis can lead to an infection if you repeatedly scratch the affected area, causing it to become wet and oozing.	general
This creates a good place for bacteria or fungi to grow and may cause an infection.	general
General prevention steps include the following: Try to identify and avoid substances that irritate your skin or cause an allergic reaction.	general
Avoid irritants and allergens.	general
You might be able to remove most of the rash-causing substance if you wash your skin right away after coming into contact with it.	general
Use a mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water.	general
Rinse completely.	general
Also wash any clothing or other items that may have come into contact with a plant allergen, such as poison ivy.	general
Wash your skin.	general
Face masks, goggles, gloves and other protective items can shield you from irritating substances, including household cleansers.	general
Wear protective clothing or gloves.	general
This can help you avoid a reaction to jean snaps, for example.	general
Apply an iron-on patch to cover metal fasteners next to your skin.	general
These products can provide a protective layer for your skin.	general
For example, an over-the-counter skin cream containing bentoquatam (IvyBlock) may prevent or lessen your skin's reaction to poison ivy.	general
Apply a barrier cream or gel.	general
Regularly applying moisturizing lotions can help restore your skin's outermost layer and keep your skin supple.	general
Use moisturizer.	general
Allergens from plants, such as poison ivy, can cling to pets and then be spread to people.	general
Take care around pets.	general
Video: Allergy or irritant: The truth about your rash Show transcript for video Video: Allergy or irritant: The truth about your rash Hand-washing is essential for preventing the spread of germs.	general
But, sometimes, all this scrubbing can cause a rash.	general
Does this mean you're allergic to the soap?	general
"""One important thing to differentiate from allergic contact dermatitis is irritant contact dermatitis,"" says Mayo Clinic dermatologist Dawn Davis, M.D."	general
Dr. Davis says allergic dermatitis means a substance is causing an allergic reaction on your skin.	general
But irritant contact dermatitis means your skin is inflamed from repeated exposure to something.	general
"""For example, if I used lye soap on my skin, and I used it over and over again, I would develop an irritant contact dermatitis simply from eroding away the natural barrier of my skin with repetitive washing,"" says Dr. Davis."	general
Dr. Davis says it's not always easy to tell the difference between an allergy or irritant.	general
"""So it's very helpful to go to a health provider, especially a dermatologist or allergist, to help differentiate between irritant contact dermatitis and an allergy,"" says Dr. Davis."	general
That way you can properly treat the rash and prevent it from happening again.	general
Convergence insufficiency is a condition in which your eyes are unable to work together when looking at nearby objects.	general
This condition causes one eye to turn outward instead of inward with the other eye creating double or blurred vision.	general
Convergence insufficiency is usually diagnosed in school-age children and adolescents.	general
It can cause difficulty reading, for which parents or teachers might suspect the child has learning difficulties rather than an eye disorder.	general
Treatments are usually effective for convergence insufficiency.	general
Not everyone with convergence insufficiency has signs and symptoms.	general
Signs and symptoms occur while you're reading or doing other close work and might include: Tired, sore or uncomfortable eyes (eyestrain) Difficulty reading ‚Äî words seem to float on the page, you lose your place or you read slowly ‚Äî which might cause you to avoid reading or not complete schoolwork Double vision (diplopia) When to see a doctor If you or your child has symptoms of convergence insufficiency or problems reading, consult an eye care professional ‚Äî an ophthalmologist or an optometrist.	general
The cause of convergence insufficiency isn't known, but it involves a misalignment of the eyes when focusing on nearby objects.	general
The misalignment involves the muscles that move the eye.	general
Typically, one eye drifts outward when you're focusing on a word or object at close range.	general
Complications Difficulties with reading and concentrating can affect a child's learning.	general
Convergence insufficiency does not cause learning disabilities, but it makes using your eyes difficult and tiring.	general
Convergence insufficiency typically isn't detected in routine eye exams or school-based vision screenings.	general
Reading difficulties of children with the condition might lead to an evaluation for learning disabilities, but it's important to rule out this eye disorder.	general
Coronary artery disease develops when the major blood vessels that supply your heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients (coronary arteries) become damaged or diseased.	general
Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in your arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease.	general
When plaque builds up, it narrows your coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart.	general
Eventually, the decreased blood flow may cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms.	general
A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.	general
Because coronary artery disease often develops over decades, you might not notice a problem until you have a significant blockage or a heart attack.	general
But there's plenty you can do to prevent and treat coronary artery disease.	general
A healthy lifestyle can make a big impact.	general
Products & Services If your coronary arteries narrow, they can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart ‚Äî especially when it's beating hard, such as during exercise.	general
At first, the decreased blood flow may not cause any coronary artery disease symptoms.	general
As plaque continues to build up in your coronary arteries, however, you may develop coronary artery disease signs and symptoms, including: You may feel pressure or tightness in your chest, as if someone were standing on your chest.	general
This pain, referred to as angina, usually occurs on the middle or left side of the chest.	general
Angina is generally triggered by physical or emotional stress.	general
Chest pain (angina).	general
The pain usually goes away within minutes after stopping the stressful activity.	general
In some people, especially women, this pain may be fleeting or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back.	general
If your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue with exertion.	general
Shortness of breath.	general
A completely blocked coronary artery will cause a heart attack.	general
The classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing pressure in your chest and pain in your shoulder or arm, sometimes with shortness of breath and sweating.	general
Heart attack.	general
Women are somewhat more likely than men are to experience less typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack, such as neck or jaw pain.	general
Sometimes a heart attack occurs without any apparent signs or symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor If you suspect you're having a heart attack, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number.	general
If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital.	general
Drive yourself only as a last resort.	general
If you have risk factors for coronary artery disease ‚Äî such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes, a strong family history of heart disease or obesity ‚Äî talk to your doctor.	general
He or she may want to test you for the condition, especially if you have signs or symptoms of narrowed arteries.	general
Development of atherosclerosis Development of atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a process in which blood fats such as cholesterol and other substances build up on your artery walls.	general
Eventually, deposits called plaques may form.	general
The deposits may narrow, or block, your arteries.	general
Plaques can also rupture, causing a blood clot.	general
Coronary artery disease is thought to begin with damage or injury to the inner layer of a coronary artery, sometimes as early as childhood.	general
The damage may be caused by various factors, including: Sedentary lifestyle Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, fatty deposits (plaque) made of cholesterol and other cellular waste products tend to accumulate at the site of injury in a process called atherosclerosis.	general
If the surface of the plaque breaks or ruptures, blood cells called platelets will clump at the site to try to repair the artery.	general
This clump can block the artery, leading to a heart attack.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for coronary artery disease include: Simply getting older increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries.	general
Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease.	general
However, the risk for women increases after menopause.	general
A family history of heart disease is associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a close relative developed heart disease at an early age.	general
Your risk is highest if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before age 55 or if your mother or a sister developed it before age 65.	general
Family history.	general
People who smoke have a significantly increased risk of heart disease.	general
Exposing others to your secondhand smoke also increases their risk of coronary artery disease.	general
Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the channel through which blood can flow.	general
High blood pressure.	general
High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of formation of plaque and atherosclerosis.	general
"High cholesterol can be caused by a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, known as the ""bad"" cholesterol."	general
"A low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, known as the ""good"" cholesterol, can also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis."	general
High blood cholesterol levels.	general
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.	general
Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.	general
Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors.	general
Overweight or obesity.	general
Lack of exercise also is associated with coronary artery disease and some of its risk factors, as well.	general
Physical inactivity.	general
Unrelieved stress in your life may damage your arteries as well as worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease.	general
High stress.	general
Eating too much food that has high amounts of saturated fat, trans fat, salt and sugar can increase your risk of coronary artery disease.	general
Unhealthy diet.	general
Risk factors often occur in clusters and may build on one another, such as obesity leading to type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.	general
When grouped together, certain risk factors put you at an even greater risk of coronary artery disease.	general
"For example, metabolic syndrome ‚Äî a cluster of conditions that includes elevated blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL, or ""good,"" cholesterol, elevated insulin levels and excess body fat around the waist ‚Äî increases the risk of coronary artery disease."	general
Sometimes coronary artery disease develops without any classic risk factors.	general
Researchers are studying other possible factors, including: This disorder causes you to repeatedly stop and start breathing while you're sleeping.	general
Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during sleep apnea increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system, possibly leading to coronary artery disease.	general
Sleep apnea.	general
High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a normal protein that appears in higher amounts when there's inflammation somewhere in your body.	general
High hs-CRP levels may be a risk factor for heart disease.	general
It's thought that as coronary arteries narrow, you'll have more hs-CRP in your blood.	general
High sensitivity C-reactive protein.	general
This is a type of fat (lipid) in your blood.	general
High levels may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially for women.	general
High triglycerides.	general
Homocysteine is an amino acid your body uses to make protein and to build and maintain tissue.	general
But high levels of homocysteine may increase your risk of coronary artery disease.	general
Homocysteine.	general
This condition that can develop in women during pregnancy causes high blood pressure and a higher amount of protein in urine.	general
It can lead to a higher risk of heart disease later in life.	general
Preeclampsia.	general
Heavy alcohol use can lead to heart muscle damage.	general
It can also worsen other risk factors of coronary artery disease.	general
Alcohol use.	general
Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus (and other inflammatory rheumatologic conditions) have an increased risk of atherosclerosis.	general
Autoimmune diseases.	general
Complications Coronary artery disease can lead to: When your coronary arteries narrow, your heart may not receive enough blood when demand is greatest ‚Äî particularly during physical activity.	general
This can cause chest pain (angina) or shortness of breath.	general
Chest pain (angina).	general
If a cholesterol plaque ruptures and a blood clot forms, complete blockage of your heart artery may trigger a heart attack.	general
The lack of blood flow to your heart may damage your heart muscle.	general
The amount of damage depends in part on how quickly you receive treatment.	general
Heart attack.	general
If some areas of your heart are chronically deprived of oxygen and nutrients because of reduced blood flow, or if your heart has been damaged by a heart attack, your heart may become too weak to pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.	general
This condition is known as heart failure.	general
Heart failure.	general
Inadequate blood supply to the heart or damage to heart tissue can interfere with your heart's electrical impulses, causing abnormal heart rhythms.	general
Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia).	general
The same lifestyle habits that can help treat coronary artery disease can also help prevent it from developing in the first place.	general
Leading a healthy lifestyle can help keep your arteries strong and clear of plaque.	general
Small vessel disease Small vessel disease Clogging or narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your heart can occur not only in your heart's largest arteries (the coronary arteries) but also in your heart's smaller blood vessels.	general
Small vessel disease is a condition in which the walls of the small arteries in the heart are damaged.	general
The condition causes signs and symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain (angina).	general
Small vessel disease is sometimes called coronary microvascular disease or small vessel heart disease.	general
It's often diagnosed after a doctor finds little or no narrowing in the main arteries of your heart, despite your having symptoms that suggest heart disease.	general
Small vessel disease is more common in women and in people who have diabetes or high blood pressure.	general
The condition is treatable but can be difficult to detect.	general
Products & Services Small vessel disease signs and symptoms include: Chest pain, squeezing or discomfort (angina), which may worsen during daily activities and times of stress Discomfort in your left arm, jaw, neck, back or abdomen associated with chest pain Shortness of breath Tiredness and lack of energy If you've been treated for coronary artery disease with angioplasty and stents and your signs and symptoms haven't gone away, you might also have small vessel disease.	general
When to see a doctor If you're having chest pain and other signs and symptoms ‚Äî such as shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, or pain that radiates beyond your chest to one or both of your arms or to your neck ‚Äî seek emergency medical care.	general
It might be hard to tell if your symptoms are due to small vessel disease, especially if you don't have chest pain.	general
If you do have chest pain, see your doctor to find out the cause.	general
Experts suspect that the causes of small vessel disease are the same as the causes for disease of the larger vessels of the heart, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes.	general
The large vessels in your heart can become narrowed or blocked through a condition in which fatty deposits build up in the arteries (atherosclerosis).	general
In small vessel disease, damage to the small vessels affects their ability to expand (endothelial dysfunction).	general
As a result, your heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.	general
Risk factors Small vessel disease is more common in women.	general
Risk factors include: Tobacco use Unhealthy diet Inactive lifestyle Polycystic ovarian syndrome Increasing age, older than 45 in men and older than 55 in women Chronic inflammation It's not clear why the same risk factors, such as obesity or an inactive lifestyle, cause some people to develop small vessel disease instead of large vessel coronary artery disease.	general
Complications Because small vessel disease can make it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body, the condition, if untreated, can cause serious problems, such as: Coronary artery spasm There are no studies about preventing small vessel disease, but it seems that controlling the disease's major risk factors ‚Äî high blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity ‚Äî can help.	general
Things you can do that might reduce your risk include: If you smoke, stop.	general
Quitting other forms of tobacco use can also be helpful.	general
Talk to your doctor if you have trouble quitting.	general
Don't smoke or use other tobacco products.	general
Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes whole grains, lean meat, low-fat dairy, and fruits and vegetables.	general
Limit salt, sugar, alcohol, and saturated fat and trans fats.	general
Eat a heart-healthy diet.	general
Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function and keeps blood flowing through your arteries.	general
It can also prevent a heart attack by helping you to achieve and maintain a healthy weight and control diabetes, elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure.	general
Exercise regularly.	general
Exercise doesn't have to be vigorous.	general
Walking 30 minutes a day five days a week can improve your health.	general
Have your blood cholesterol levels checked regularly through a blood test.	general
"If your ""bad"" cholesterol levels are high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications to help lower the numbers and protect your cardiovascular health."	general
Check your cholesterol.	general
Ask your doctor how frequently you should have your blood pressure checked.	general
He or she might recommend more-frequent checks if you have high blood pressure or a history of heart disease.	general
Control your blood pressure.	general
Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life.	general
Yoga, meditation and listening to music can help reduce stress.	general
Manage stress.	general
Keep your blood sugar at appropriate levels to help reduce the risk of complications.	general
Work with your doctor to establish blood sugar goals that are right for you.	general
Control blood sugar levels if you have diabetes.	general
Corticobasal degeneration is a rare disease in which areas of your brain shrink and your nerve cells degenerate and die over time.	general
The disease affects the area of the brain that processes information and brain structures that control movement.	general
This degeneration results in growing difficulty in movement on one or both sides of your body.	general
The condition may cause you to have poor coordination, stiffness, difficulty thinking, trouble with speech or language, or other problems.	general
Signs and symptoms of corticobasal degeneration include: Difficulty moving on one or both sides of the body, which gets worse over time Poor coordination Abnormal postures of the hands or feet, such as a hand forming a clenched fist Muscle jerks Difficulty swallowing Corticobasal degeneration progresses over six to eight years.	general
Eventually, people with corticobasal syndrome can become unable to walk.	general
The causes of corticobasal degeneration are unknown, but research suggests that a protein in the brain called tau may play a role in the disease.	general
A buildup of tau in brain cells may lead to their deterioration and the symptoms of corticobasal degeneration.	general
It's important to know that you can have signs and symptoms that look like corticobasal degeneration but that are caused by another degenerative disease of the brain, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.	general
Half of the people who have signs and symptoms of corticobasal degeneration have another disease.	general
Complications The symptoms of corticobasal degeneration progress to serious complications, such as pneumonia or sepsis, a life-threatening response to an infection.	general
Corticobasal degeneration complications ultimately lead to death.	general
Cough headaches are an unusual type of headache triggered by coughing and other types of straining ‚Äî such as from sneezing, blowing your nose, laughing, crying, singing, bending over or having a bowel movement.	general
Doctors divide cough headaches into two categories.	general
Primary cough headaches are usually harmless, occur in limited episodes and eventually improve on their own.	general
Secondary cough headaches are more serious, as they can be caused by problems within the brain.	general
Treatment of secondary cough headaches may require surgery.	general
Products & Services Primary cough headaches Begin suddenly with and just after coughing or other types of straining Typically last a few seconds to a few minutes ‚Äî some can last up to two hours Cause sharp, stabbing or splitting pain Usually affect both sides of your head and may be worse in the back of your head May be followed by a dull, aching pain for hours Secondary cough headaches Secondary cough headaches often have symptoms similar to those of primary cough headaches, though you may experience: Longer lasting headaches When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if you experience sudden headaches after coughing ‚Äî especially if the headaches are frequent or severe or you have any other troubling signs or symptoms, such as imbalance or blurred or double vision.	general
Secondary cough headaches A defect in the shape of the skull.	general
A defect in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance.	general
This can occur when a portion of the brain is forced through the opening at the base of the skull (foramen magnum), where only the spinal cord is supposed to be.	general
Some of these types of defects are called Chiari malformations.	general
A weakness in one of the blood vessels in the brain (cerebral aneurysm).	general
A brain tumor.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for primary cough headaches include: Primary cough headaches most often affect people older than age 40.	general
Men are more prone to getting primary cough headaches.	general
Secondary cough headaches Being younger than age 40 Preventing the actions that trigger your cough headaches ‚Äî whether that's coughing, sneezing or straining on the toilet ‚Äî may help reduce the number of headaches you experience.	general
Pubic lice, commonly called crabs, are tiny insects found in your genital area.	general
They are a different type of louse from head lice and body lice.	general
Measuring 1/16 inch (1.	general
6 millimeters) or less, pubic lice received their nickname because their bodies resemble tiny crabs.	general
The most common way to acquire pubic lice is through sexual intercourse.	general
In children, pubic lice may be found in their eyebrows or eyelashes and can be a sign of sexual abuse.	general
However, it may be possible to catch pubic lice after sharing clothing, bed linens or towels with an infested person.	general
Pubic lice feed on your blood, and their bites can cause severe itching.	general
Treatment includes applying over-the-counter creams and lotions that kill the parasites and their eggs.	general
If you have pubic lice (crabs), you may experience intense itching in your genital region.	general
Pubic lice can spread to other areas with coarse body hair, including the: When to see a doctor Seek medical advice about pubic lice treatment if: Over-the-counter products don't kill the lice You're pregnant Pubic lice are most commonly transmitted during sexual activity.	general
You may also acquire pubic lice from contaminated sheets, blankets, towels or clothes.	general
Risk factors People who have other sexually transmitted infections are more likely to also have pubic lice.	general
Complications Pubic lice infestations can usually be treated with a louse-killing lotion or gel.	general
However, a pubic lice infestation sometimes leads to complications such as: Pale blue spots may develop where pubic lice have been feeding continually.	general
Discolored skin.	general
If itchy lice bites cause you to scratch yourself raw, these wounds can become infected.	general
Secondary infections.	general
Children who have pubic lice on their eyelashes may develop a type of pink eye (conjunctivitis).	general
Eye irritations.	general
To prevent pubic lice infestation, avoid having sexual contact or sharing bedding or clothing with anyone who has an infestation.	general
If you are being treated for pubic lice, all sexual partners must also be treated.	general
Cradle cap on light skin Cradle cap on light skin Cradle cap is characterized by scaly patches on a baby's scalp.	general
You may notice thick, yellow patches of skin.	general
The patches may be crusty or greasy.	general
Cradle cap on dark skin Cradle cap on dark skin Cradle cap appears as patchy scaling or thick crusts on the scalp and greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales.	general
Cradle cap usually doesn't bother the infant.	general
Cradle cap causes crusty or oily scaly patches on a baby's scalp.	general
The condition isn't painful or itchy.	general
But it can cause thick white or yellow scales that aren't easy to remove.	general
Cradle cap usually clears up on its own in weeks or a few months.	general
Home care measures include washing your baby's scalp daily with a mild shampoo.	general
This can help you loosen and remove the scales.	general
Don't scratch cradle cap.	general
If cradle cap persists or seems severe, your doctor may suggest a medicated shampoo, lotion or other treatment.	general
Patchy scaling or thick crusts on the scalp Oily or dry skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales Skin flakes Possibly mild redness Similar scales may also be present on the ears, eyelids, nose and groin.	general
Cradle cap is common in newborns.	general
It usually isn't itchy.	general
Cradle cap is the common term for infantile seborrheic dermatitis.	general
It's sometimes confused with another skin condition, atopic dermatitis.	general
A major difference between these conditions is that atopic dermatitis usually causes significant itching.	general
When to see a doctor See your baby's doctor if: You've tried treating it at home without success The patches spread to your baby's face or body The cause of cradle cap isn't known.	general
One contributing factor may be hormones that pass from the mother to the baby before birth.	general
These hormones can cause too much production of oil (sebum) in the oil glands and hair follicles.	general
Another factor may be a yeast (fungus) called malassezia (mal-uh-SEE-zhuh) that grows in the sebum along with bacteria.	general
Antifungal treatments, such as ketoconazole, are often effective, supporting the idea that yeast is a contributing factor.	general
Cradle cap isn't contagious, and it's not caused by poor hygiene.	general
Shampooing your baby's hair every few days can help prevent cradle cap.	general
Stick with a mild baby shampoo unless your baby's doctor recommends something stronger.	general
A muscle cramp is a sudden and involuntary contraction of one or more of your muscles.	general
If you've ever been awakened in the night or stopped in your tracks by a sudden charley horse, you know that muscle cramps can cause severe pain.	general
Though generally harmless, muscle cramps can make it temporarily impossible to use the affected muscle.	general
Long periods of exercise or physical labor, particularly in hot weather, can lead to muscle cramps.	general
Some medications and certain medical conditions also may cause muscle cramps.	general
You usually can treat muscle cramps at home with self-care measures.	general
Products & Services Most muscle cramps develop in the leg muscles, particularly in the calf.	general
Besides the sudden, sharp pain, you might also feel or see a hard lump of muscle tissue beneath your skin.	general
When to see a doctor Muscle cramps usually disappear on their own and are rarely serious enough to require medical care.	general
However, see your doctor if your cramps: Cause severe discomfort Are associated with muscle weakness Happen frequently Aren't associated with an obvious cause, such as strenuous exercise Overuse of a muscle, dehydration, muscle strain or simply holding a position for a prolonged period can cause a muscle cramp.	general
In many cases, however, the cause isn't known.	general
Although most muscle cramps are harmless, some may be related to an underlying medical condition, such as: Narrowing of the arteries that deliver blood to your legs (arteriosclerosis of the extremities) can produce cramp-like pain in your legs and feet while you're exercising.	general
These cramps usually go away soon after you stop exercising.	general
Inadequate blood supply.	general
Compression of nerves in your spine (lumbar stenosis) also can produce cramp-like pain in your legs.	general
The pain usually worsens the longer you walk.	general
Walking in a slightly flexed position ‚Äî such as you would use when pushing a shopping cart ahead of you ‚Äî may improve or delay the onset of your symptoms.	general
Nerve compression.	general
Too little potassium, calcium or magnesium in your diet can contribute to leg cramps.	general
Diuretics ‚Äî medications often prescribed for high blood pressure ‚Äî also can deplete these minerals.	general
Mineral depletion.	general
Risk factors Factors that might increase your risk of muscle cramps include: Older people lose muscle mass, so the remaining muscle can get overstressed more easily.	general
Athletes who become fatigued and dehydrated while participating in warm-weather sports frequently develop muscle cramps.	general
Dehydration.	general
Muscle cramps also are common during pregnancy.	general
You might be at higher risk of muscle cramps if you have diabetes, or nerve, liver or thyroid disorders.	general
Medical conditions.	general
These steps may help prevent cramps: Drink plenty of liquids every day.	general
The amount depends on what you eat, your sex, your level of activity, the weather, your health, your age and medications you take.	general
Fluids help your muscles contract and relax and keep muscle cells hydrated and less irritable.	general
During activity, replenish fluids at regular intervals, and continue drinking water or other fluids after you're finished.	general
Avoid dehydration.	general
Stretch before and after you use any muscle for an extended period.	general
If you tend to have leg cramps at night, stretch before bedtime.	general
Light exercise, such as riding a stationary bicycle for a few minutes before bedtime, also may help prevent cramps while you're sleeping.	general
Stretch your muscles.	general
Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) are throbbing or cramping pains in the lower abdomen.	general
Many women have menstrual cramps just before and during their menstrual periods.	general
For some women, the discomfort is merely annoying.	general
For others, menstrual cramps can be severe enough to interfere with everyday activities for a few days every month.	general
Conditions such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids can cause menstrual cramps.	general
Treating the cause is key to reducing the pain.	general
Menstrual cramps that aren't caused by another condition tend to lessen with age and often improve after giving birth.	general
Symptoms of menstrual cramps include: Throbbing or cramping pain in your lower abdomen that can be intense Pain that starts 1 to 3 days before your period, peaks 24 hours after the onset of your period and subsides in 2 to 3 days Dull, continuous ache Some women also have: When to see a doctor If menstrual cramps disrupt your life every month, if your symptoms progressively worsen or if you just started having severe menstrual cramps after age 25, see your doctor.	general
During your menstrual period, your uterus contracts to help expel its lining.	general
Hormonelike substances (prostaglandins) involved in pain and inflammation trigger the uterine muscle contractions.	general
Higher levels of prostaglandins are associated with more-severe menstrual cramps.	general
Menstrual cramps can be caused by: The tissue that lines your uterus becomes implanted outside your uterus, most commonly on your fallopian tubes, ovaries or the tissue lining your pelvis.	general
Endometriosis.	general
These noncancerous growths in the wall of the uterus can cause pain.	general
Uterine fibroids.	general
The tissue that lines your uterus begins to grow into the muscular walls of the uterus.	general
Adenomyosis.	general
This infection of the female reproductive organs is usually caused by sexually transmitted bacteria.	general
Pelvic inflammatory disease.	general
In some women, the opening of the cervix is small enough to impede menstrual flow, causing a painful increase of pressure within the uterus.	general
Cervical stenosis.	general
Risk factors You're younger than age 30 You started puberty early, at age 11 or younger You bleed heavily during periods (menorrhagia) You have irregular menstrual bleeding (metrorrhagia) You have a family history of menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) Complications Menstrual cramps don't cause other medical complications, but they can interfere with school, work and social activities.	general
Certain conditions associated with menstrual cramps can have complications, though.	general
For example, endometriosis can cause fertility problems.	general
Pelvic inflammatory disease can scar your fallopian tubes, increasing the risk of a fertilized egg implanting outside of your uterus (ectopic pregnancy).	general
Pituitary gland and hypothalamus Pituitary gland and hypothalamus The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are located within the brain and control hormone production.	general
Craniopharyngioma is a rare type of noncancerous (benign) brain tumor.	general
Craniopharyngioma begins near the brain's pituitary gland, which secretes hormones that control many body functions.	general
As a craniopharyngioma slowly grows, it can affect the function of the pituitary gland and other nearby structures in the brain.	general
Craniopharyngioma can occur at any age, but it occurs most often in children and older adults.	general
Symptoms include gradual changes in vision, fatigue, excessive urination and headaches.	general
Children with craniopharyngioma may grow slowly and may be smaller than expected.	general
Tests and procedures used to diagnose craniopharyngioma include: Diagnosing a craniopharyngioma usually starts with a medical history review and a neurological exam by your doctor.	general
During this procedure, your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, reflexes, and growth and development are tested.	general
Physical exam.	general
Blood tests may reveal changes in hormone levels that indicate a tumor is affecting your pituitary gland.	general
Blood tests.	general
Tests to create images of your brain may include X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT).	general
Imaging tests.	general
Craniopharyngioma treatment options include: Surgery to remove all or most of the tumor is most often recommended for people with craniopharyngioma.	general
What type of operation is performed depends on the location and size of your tumor.	general
Open craniopharyngioma surgery (craniotomy) involves opening the skull to gain access to the tumor.	general
During minimally invasive craniopharyngioma surgery (transsphenoidal procedure), special surgical tools are inserted through your nose.	general
The tools pass through a natural corridor to the tumor, without affecting the brain.	general
When possible, surgeons remove the entire tumor.	general
But because there are often many delicate and important structures nearby, doctors sometimes don't remove the entire tumor in order to ensure a good quality of life after the operation.	general
In those situations, other treatments may be used after surgery.	general
External beam radiation therapy may be used after surgery to treat craniopharyngioma.	general
This treatment uses powerful energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill tumor cells.	general
During external beam radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine precisely aims the energy to the tumor cells.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Specialized external beam radiation technology, such as proton beam therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), allows doctors to carefully shape and aim the radiation beam so that it delivers treatment to the tumor cells and spares nearby healthy tissue.	general
A type of radiation therapy called stereotactic radiosurgery may be recommended in uncommon situations when the tumor doesn't touch the bundle of nerve fibers that transmits visual information from your eye to your brain (optic nerve).	general
Technically a type of radiation and not an operation, stereotactic radiosurgery focuses multiple beams of radiation on precise points to kill the tumor cells.	general
Another type of radiation therapy called brachytherapy involves placement of radioactive material directly into the tumor where it can radiate the tumor from the inside.	general
Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill tumor cells.	general
Chemotherapy can be injected directly into the tumor so that the treatment reaches the target cells and isn't likely to damage nearby healthy tissue.	general
Chemotherapy.	general
An uncommon type of craniopharyngioma called papillary craniopharyngioma may respond to targeted therapy.	general
Targeted therapy is a drug treatment that focuses on specific abnormalities within the tumor cells that allows them to survive.	general
Treatment for papillary craniopharyngioma.	general
Nearly all papillary craniopharyngioma cells contain a mutation in a gene called the BRAF gene.	general
Targeted therapy aimed at this mutation may be a treatment option.	general
Specialized laboratory testing can reveal whether your craniopharyngioma contains papillary cells and whether those cells have the BRAF gene mutation.	general
Clinical trials are studies of new treatments or new ways of using existing treatments.	general
A clinical trial gives you the chance to try the latest treatments, but the side effects may not be known.	general
Ask your doctor whether you're eligible to participate in clinical trials.	general
Clinical trials.	general
Cranial sutures and fontanels Cranial sutures and fontanels Joints made of strong, fibrous tissue (cranial sutures) hold the bones of your baby's skull together.	general
The sutures meet at the fontanels, the soft spots on your baby's head.	general
The sutures remain flexible during infancy, allowing the skull to expand as the brain grows.	general
The largest fontanel is at the front (anterior).	general
Craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis) is a birth defect in which one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of your baby's skull (cranial sutures) close prematurely (fuse), before your baby's brain is fully formed.	general
Brain growth continues, giving the head a misshapen appearance.	general
Normally, during infancy the sutures remain flexible, giving your baby's brain time to grow.	general
In the front of the skull, the sutures meet in the large soft spot (fontanel) on top of the head.	general
The anterior fontanel is the soft spot you feel just behind your baby's forehead.	general
The next largest is at the back (posterior).	general
Each side of the skull has a tiny fontanel.	general
Craniosynostosis usually involves premature fusion of a single cranial suture, but can involve more than one of the sutures in your baby's skull (multiple suture craniosynostosis).	general
In rare cases, craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes (syndromic craniosynostosis).	general
Treating craniosynostosis involves surgery to correct the shape of the head and allow for normal brain growth.	general
Early diagnosis and treatment allow your baby's brain adequate space to grow and develop.	general
Although neurological damage can occur in severe cases, most children have normal cognitive development and achieve good cosmetic results after surgery.	general
Early diagnosis and treatment are key.	general
The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they'll become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life.	general
Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs.	general
These can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected An abnormal feeling or disappearing fontanel on your baby's skull Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures Slow or no growth of the head as your baby grows Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis.	general
Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture.	general
Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures.	general
Most cases of multiple suture craniosynostosis are linked to genetic syndromes and are called syndromic craniosynostosis.	general
The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected.	general
Types of craniosynostosis include: Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow.	general
Sagittal craniosynostosis results in a head shape called scaphocephaly and is the most common type of craniosynostosis.	general
Sagittal (scaphocephaly).	general
Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side.	general
It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side.	general
When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward.	general
The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture.	general
Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head.	general
This is also called trigonocephaly.	general
Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head.	general
It may cause one side of your baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side.	general
Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis.	general
For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time on one side of his or her head.	general
This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more normal appearance.	general
When to see a doctor Your doctor will routinely monitor your child's head growth at well-child visits.	general
Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby's head growth or shape.	general
Often the cause of craniosynostosis is not known, but sometimes it's related to genetic disorders.	general
is the most common type of craniosynostosis, and its cause is unknown, although it's thought to be a combination of genes and environmental factors.	general
Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes, such as Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome or Crouzon syndrome, which can affect your baby's skull development.	general
These syndromes usually also include other physical features and health problems.	general
Syndromic craniosynostosis Complications Permanent head and facial deformity Poor self-esteem and social isolation The risk of increased pressure inside the skull (intracranial pressure) from simple craniosynostosis is small, as long as the suture and head shape are fixed surgically.	general
But babies with an underlying syndrome may develop increased intracranial pressure if their skulls don't expand enough to make room for their growing brains.	general
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old.	general
SIDS is sometimes known as crib death because the infants often die in their cribs.	general
Although the cause is unknown, it appears that SIDS might be associated with defects in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep.	general
Researchers have discovered some factors that might put babies at extra risk.	general
They've also identified measures you can take to help protect your child from SIDS.	general
Perhaps the most important is placing your baby on his or her back to sleep.	general
A combination of physical and sleep environmental factors can make an infant more vulnerable to SIDS.	general
These factors vary from child to child.	general
Physical factors Physical factors associated with SIDS include: Brain defects.	general
Some infants are born with problems that make them more likely to die of SIDS.	general
In many of these babies, the portion of the brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep hasn't matured enough to work properly.	general
Low birth weight.	general
Premature birth or being part of a multiple birth increases the likelihood that a baby's brain hasn't matured completely, so he or she has less control over such automatic processes as breathing and heart rate.	general
Respiratory infection.	general
Many infants who died of SIDS had recently had a cold, which might contribute to breathing problems.	general
Sleep environmental factors The items in a baby's crib and his or her sleeping position can combine with a baby's physical problems to increase the risk of SIDS.	general
Examples include: Sleeping on the stomach or side.	general
Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more difficulty breathing than those placed on their backs.	general
Sleeping on a soft surface.	general
Lying face down on a fluffy comforter, a soft mattress or a waterbed can block an infant's airway.	general
Sharing a bed.	general
While the risk of SIDS is lowered if an infant sleeps in the same room as his or her parents, the risk increases if the baby sleeps in the same bed with parents, siblings or pets.	general
Overheating.	general
Being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby's risk of SIDS.	general
Risk factors Although sudden infant death syndrome can strike any infant, researchers have identified several factors that might increase a baby's risk.	general
They include: Boys are slightly more likely to die of SIDS.	general
Infants are most vulnerable between the second and fourth months of life.	general
For reasons that aren't well-understood, nonwhite infants are more likely to develop SIDS.	general
Babies who've had siblings or cousins die of SIDS are at higher risk of SIDS.	general
Family history.	general
Babies who live with smokers have a higher risk of SIDS.	general
Secondhand smoke.	general
Both being born early and having a low birth weight increase your baby's chances of SIDS.	general
Being premature.	general
Maternal risk factors During pregnancy, the mother also affects her baby's risk of SIDS, especially if she: Is younger than 20 There's no guaranteed way to prevent SIDS, but you can help your baby sleep more safely by following these tips: Place your baby to sleep on his or her back, rather than on the stomach or side, every time you ‚Äî or anyone else ‚Äî put the baby to sleep for the first year of life.	general
This isn't necessary when your baby's awake or able to roll over both ways without help.	general
Back to sleep.	general
Don't assume that others will place your baby to sleep in the correct position ‚Äî insist on it.	general
Advise sitters and child care providers not to use the stomach position to calm an upset baby.	general
Use a firm mattress and avoid placing your baby on thick, fluffy padding, such as lambskin or a thick quilt.	general
Don't leave pillows, fluffy toys or stuffed animals in the crib.	general
These can interfere with breathing if your baby's face presses against them.	general
Keep the crib as bare as possible.	general
To keep your baby warm, try a sleep sack or other sleep clothing that doesn't require additional covers.	general
Don't cover your baby's head.	general
Don't overheat your baby.	general
Ideally, your baby should sleep in your room with you, but alone in a crib, bassinet or other structure designed for infants, for at least six months, and, if possible, up to a year.	general
Have your baby sleep in in your room.	general
Adult beds aren't safe for infants.	general
A baby can become trapped and suffocate between the headboard slats, the space between the mattress and the bed frame, or the space between the mattress and the wall.	general
A baby can also suffocate if a sleeping parent accidentally rolls over and covers the baby's nose and mouth.	general
Breast-feeding for at least six months lowers the risk of SIDS.	general
Breast-feed your baby, if possible.	general
The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages the use of monitors and other devices because of ineffectiveness and safety issues.	general
Don't use baby monitors and other commercial devices that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS.	general
Sucking on a pacifier without a strap or string at naptime and bedtime might reduce the risk of SIDS.	general
One caveat ‚Äî if you're breast-feeding, wait to offer a pacifier until your baby is 3 to 4 weeks old and you've settled into a nursing routine.	general
Offer a pacifier.	general
If your baby's not interested in the pacifier, don't force it.	general
Try again another day.	general
If the pacifier falls out of your baby's mouth while he or she is sleeping, don't pop it back in.	general
There's no evidence that routine immunizations increase SIDS risk.	general
Some evidence indicates immunizations can help prevent SIDS.	general
Immunize your baby.	general
Colon and rectum Colon and rectum The colon, also called the large intestine, is a long, tubelike organ in your abdomen.	general
The colon carries waste to be expelled from the body.	general
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).	general
It causes inflammation of your digestive tract, which can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition.	general
Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people.	general
The inflammation caused by Crohn's disease often spreads deep into the layers of affected bowel tissue.	general
Crohn's disease can be both painful and debilitating, and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications.	general
While there's no known cure for Crohn's disease, therapies can greatly reduce its signs and symptoms and even bring about long-term remission.	general
With treatment, many people with Crohn's disease are able to function well.	general
Digestive system Digestive system Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both forms of inflammatory bowel disease.	general
Crohn's disease most commonly affects the colon and the last part of the small intestine (ileum).	general
Ulcerative colitis affects the colon.	general
In some people with Crohn's disease, only the last segment of the small intestine (ileum) is affected.	general
In others, the disease is confined to the colon (part of the large intestine).	general
The most common areas affected by Crohn's disease are the last part of the small intestine and the colon.	general
Signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease can range from mild to severe.	general
They usually develop gradually, but sometimes will come on suddenly, without warning.	general
You may also have periods of time when you have no signs or symptoms (remission).	general
When the disease is active, signs and symptoms may include: Reduced appetite and weight loss Pain or drainage near or around the anus due to inflammation from a tunnel into the skin (fistula) Other signs and symptoms Inflammation of skin, eyes and joints Inflammation of the liver or bile ducts Delayed growth or sexual development, in children When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have persistent changes in your bowel habits or if you have any of the signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease, such as: Abdominal pain Ongoing bouts of diarrhea that don't respond to over-the-counter (OTC) medications Unexplained fever lasting more than a day or two Unexplained weight loss The exact cause of Crohn's disease remains unknown.	general
Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate but don't cause Crohn's disease.	general
A number of factors, such as heredity and a malfunctioning immune system, likely play a role in its development.	general
It's possible that a virus or bacterium may trigger Crohn's disease.	general
When your immune system tries to fight off the invading microorganism, an abnormal immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too.	general
Immune system.	general
Crohn's is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role in making people more susceptible.	general
However, most people with Crohn's disease don't have a family history of the disease.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for Crohn's disease may include: Crohn's disease can occur at any age, but you're likely to develop the condition when you're young.	general
Most people who develop Crohn's disease are diagnosed before they're around 30 years old.	general
Although Crohn's disease can affect any ethnic group, whites have the highest risk, including people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent.	general
However, the incidence of Crohn's disease is increasing among blacks who live in North America and the United Kingdom.	general
You're at higher risk if you have a close relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, with the disease.	general
As many as 1 in 5 people with Crohn's disease has a family member with the disease.	general
Family history.	general
Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn's disease.	general
Smoking also leads to more-severe disease and a greater risk of having surgery.	general
If you smoke, it's important to stop.	general
Cigarette smoking.	general
These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium (Voltaren) and others.	general
While they do not cause Crohn's disease, they can lead to inflammation of the bowel that makes Crohn's disease worse.	general
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.	general
If you live in an urban area or in an industrialized country, you're more likely to develop Crohn's disease.	general
This suggests that environmental factors, including a diet high in fat or refined foods, may play a role in Crohn's disease.	general
Where you live.	general
Complications Crohn's disease may lead to one or more of the following complications: Crohn's disease affects the thickness of the intestinal wall.	general
Over time, parts of the bowel can scar and narrow, which may block the flow of digestive contents.	general
You may require surgery to remove the diseased portion of your bowel.	general
Bowel obstruction.	general
Chronic inflammation can lead to open sores (ulcers) anywhere in your digestive tract, including your mouth and anus, and in the genital area (perineum).	general
Sometimes ulcers can extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a fistula ‚Äî an abnormal connection between different body parts.	general
Fistulas can develop between your intestine and skin, or between your intestine and another organ.	general
Fistulas near or around the anal area (perianal) are the most common kind.	general
When fistulas develop in the abdomen, food may bypass areas of the bowel that are necessary for absorption.	general
Fistulas may occur between loops of bowel, into the bladder or vagina, or out through the skin, causing continuous drainage of bowel contents to your skin.	general
In some cases, a fistula may become infected and form an abscess, which can be life-threatening if not treated.	general
This is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus where infections can occur.	general
It's often associated with painful bowel movements and may lead to a perianal fistula.	general
Anal fissure.	general
Diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping may make it difficult for you to eat or for your intestine to absorb enough nutrients to keep you nourished.	general
It's also common to develop anemia due to low iron or vitamin B-12 caused by the disease.	general
Malnutrition.	general
Having Crohn's disease that affects your colon increases your risk of colon cancer.	general
General colon cancer screening guidelines for people without Crohn's disease call for a colonoscopy every 10 years beginning at age 50.	general
Ask your doctor whether you need to have this test done sooner and more frequently.	general
Colon cancer.	general
Crohn's disease can cause problems in other parts of the body.	general
Among these problems are anemia, skin disorders, osteoporosis, arthritis, and gallbladder or liver disease.	general
Other health problems.	general
Certain Crohn's disease drugs that act by blocking functions of the immune system are associated with a small risk of developing cancers such as lymphoma and skin cancers.	general
They also increase risk of infection.	general
Medication risks.	general
Corticosteroids can be associated with a risk of osteoporosis, bone fractures, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes and high blood pressure, among others.	general
Work with your doctor to determine risks and benefits of medications.	general
When the upper airway is infected with the virus that causes croup, tissues around the voice box (larynx) and the windpipe (trachea) will swell.	general
When a cough forces air through this narrowed passageway, it may sound like a seal barking.	general
Croup refers to an infection of the upper airway, which obstructs breathing and causes a characteristic barking cough.	general
The cough and other signs and symptoms of croup are the result of swelling around the voice box (larynx), windpipe (trachea) and bronchial tubes (bronchi).	general
When a cough forces air through this narrowed passageway, the swollen vocal cords produce a noise similar to a seal barking.	general
Likewise, taking a breath often produces a high-pitched whistling sound (stridor).	general
Croup typically occurs in younger children.	general
Croup usually isn't serious and most children can be treated at home.	general
Croup often begins as a typical cold.	general
If there's enough inflammation and coughing, a child will develop: Loud barking cough that's further aggravated by crying and coughing, as well as anxiety and agitation, setting up a cycle of worsening signs and symptoms Breathing that may be noisy or labored Symptoms of croup are typically worse at night and usually last for three to five days.	general
When to see a doctor If your child's symptoms are severe, worsen or last longer than three to five days or aren't responding to home treatment, contact your child's doctor.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if your child: Makes noisy, high-pitched breathing sounds both when inhaling and exhaling Makes high-pitched breathing sounds when not crying or agitated Begins drooling or has difficulty swallowing Seems anxious and agitated or fatigued and listless Breathes at a faster rate than usual Struggles to breathe Develops blue or grayish skin around the nose, mouth or fingernails (cyanosis) Croup is usually caused by a viral infection, most often a parainfluenza virus.	general
Your child may contract a virus by breathing infected respiratory droplets coughed or sneezed into the air.	general
Virus particles in these droplets may also survive on toys and other surfaces.	general
If your child touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth, an infection may follow.	general
Risk factors Most at risk of getting croup are children between 6 months and 3 years of age.	general
Because children have small airways, they are most susceptible to having more symptoms with croup.	general
Complications Most cases of croup are mild.	general
In a small percentage of children, the airway swells enough to interfere with breathing.	general
Rarely, a secondary bacterial infection of the trachea can occur, resulting in trouble breathing and requiring emergency medical care.	general
Only a small number of children seen in the emergency room for croup require hospitalization.	general
To prevent croup, take the same steps you use to prevent colds and flu.	general
Frequent hand-washing is the most important.	general
Keep your child away from anyone who's sick.	general
Encourage your child to cough or sneeze into his or her elbow.	general
To stave off more-serious infections, keep your child's vaccinations current.	general
The diphtheria and Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccines offer protection from some of the rarest ‚Äî but most dangerous ‚Äî upper airway infections.	general
There isn't a vaccine yet that protects against parainfluenza viruses.	general
Cryoglobulins are abnormal proteins in the blood.	general
If you have cryoglobulinemia (kry-o-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh), these proteins may clump together at temperatures below 98.	general
6 F (37 C).	general
These gelatinous protein clumps can impede your blood circulation, which can damage your skin, joints, nerves and organs ‚Äî particularly your kidneys and liver.	general
Symptoms usually come and go, and may include: Most people with cryoglobulinemia develop purplish skin lesions on their legs.	general
In some cases, leg ulcers also occur.	general
Skin lesions.	general
Symptoms resembling rheumatoid arthritis are common in cryoglobulinemia.	general
Joint pain.	general
Cryoglobulinemia can damage the nerves at the tips of your fingers and toes, causing numbness and other problems.	general
Peripheral neuropathy.	general
Different types of cryoglobulinemia have been associated with hepatitis C infection, certain cancers of the blood and autoimmune diseases.	general
Treatment focuses on controlling these underlying diseases and managing symptoms.	general
Symptoms of cryoglobulinemia may include purple spots on the legs, joint pain, and numbness in the fingers and toes.	general
An undescended testicle (cryptorchidism) is a testicle that hasn't moved into its proper position in the bag of skin hanging below the penis (scrotum) before birth.	general
Usually just one testicle is affected, but about 10 percent of the time both testicles are undescended.	general
An undescended testicle is uncommon in general, but common among baby boys born prematurely.	general
The vast majority of the time, the undescended testicle moves into the proper position on its own, within the first few months of life.	general
If your son has an undescended testicle that doesn't correct itself, surgery can relocate the testicle into the scrotum.	general
Not seeing or feeling a testicle where you would expect it to be in the scrotum is the main sign of an undescended testicle.	general
Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development.	general
During the last couple of months of normal fetal development, the testicles gradually descend from the abdomen through a tube-like passageway in the groin (inguinal canal) into the scrotum.	general
With an undescended testicle, that process stops or is delayed.	general
When to see a doctor An undescended testicle is typically detected when your baby is examined shortly after birth.	general
If your son has an undescended testicle, ask the doctor how often your son will need to be examined.	general
If the testicle hasn't moved into the scrotum by the time your son is 4 months old, the problem probably won't correct itself.	general
Treating an undescended testicle when your son is still a baby might lower the risk of complications later in life, such as infertility and testicular cancer.	general
"Older boys ‚Äî from infants to pre-adolescent boys ‚Äî who have normally descended testicles at birth might appear to be ""missing"" a testicle later."	general
This condition might indicate: A retractile testicle, which moves back and forth between the scrotum and the groin and might be easily guided by hand into the scrotum during a physical exam.	general
This is not abnormal and is due to a muscle reflex in the scrotum.	general
"An ascending testicle, or acquired undescended testicle, that has ""returned"" to the groin and can't be easily guided by hand into the scrotum."	general
If you notice any changes in your son's genitals or are concerned about his development, talk to your son's doctor.	general
The exact cause of an undescended testicle isn't known.	general
A combination of genetics, maternal health and other environmental factors might disrupt the hormones, physical changes and nerve activity that influence the development of the testicles.	general
Risk factors Factors that might increase the risk of an undescended testicle in a newborn include: Low birth weight Premature birth Family history of undescended testicles or other problems of genital development Conditions of the fetus that can restrict growth, such as Down syndrome or an abdominal wall defect Alcohol use by the mother during pregnancy Cigarette smoking by the mother or exposure to secondhand smoke Parents' exposure to some pesticides Complications In order for testicles to develop and function normally, they need to be slightly cooler than normal body temperature.	general
The scrotum provides this cooler environment.	general
Complications of a testicle not being located where it is supposed to be include: Testicular cancer usually begins in the cells in the testicle that produce immature sperm.	general
What causes these cells to develop into cancer is unknown.	general
Men who've had an undescended testicle have an increased risk of testicular cancer.	general
Testicular cancer.	general
The risk is greater for undescended testicles located in the abdomen than in the groin, and when both testicles are affected.	general
Surgically correcting an undescended testicle might decrease, but not eliminate, the risk of future testicular cancer.	general
Low sperm counts, poor sperm quality and decreased fertility are more likely to occur among men who've had an undescended testicle.	general
This can be due to abnormal development of the testicle, and might get worse if the condition goes untreated for an extended period of time.	general
Fertility problems.	general
Other complications related to the abnormal location of the undescended testicle include: Testicular torsion is the twisting of the spermatic cord, which contains blood vessels, nerves and the tube that carries semen from the testicle to the penis.	general
This painful condition cuts off blood to the testicle.	general
Testicular torsion.	general
If not treated promptly, this might result in the loss of the testicle.	general
Testicular torsion occurs 10 times more often in undescended testicles than in normal testicles.	general
If a testicle is located in the groin, it might be damaged from pressure against the pubic bone.	general
If the opening between the abdomen and the inguinal canal is too loose, a portion of the intestines can push into the groin.	general
Inguinal hernia.	general
Cryptosporidium infection (cryptosporidiosis) is an illness caused by tiny, one-celled cryptosporidium parasites.	general
When cryptosporidia (krip-toe-spoe-RID-e-uh) enter your body, they travel to your small intestine and then burrow into the walls.	general
Later, they're shed in your feces.	general
In most healthy people, a cryptosporidium infection produces a bout of watery diarrhea.	general
The infection usually goes away within a week or two.	general
If you have a compromised immune system, a cryptosporidium infection can become life-threatening without treatment.	general
You can help prevent a cryptosporidium infection by practicing good hygiene and avoiding swallowing water from pools, recreational water parks, lakes and streams.	general
The first signs and symptoms of cryptosporidium infection, which usually appear within a week after infection, might include: Watery diarrhea Symptoms can last for up to two weeks, though they might come and go for up to a month, even in people with healthy immune systems.	general
Some people with cryptosporidium infection have no symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor Seek medical attention if you develop watery diarrhea that does not get better within a few days.	general
Cryptosporidium infection begins when the one-celled cryptosporidium parasites get into your body through your mouth.	general
Some strains of cryptosporidium can cause more serious disease.	general
These parasites then travel to your intestinal tract, where they settle into the walls of your intestines.	general
Eventually, more cells are produced and are shed in massive quantities into your feces, where they are highly contagious.	general
You can become infected with cryptosporidia by touching anything that has come in contact with contaminated feces.	general
You can get infected by: that contains cryptosporidium parasites Drinking contaminated water that contains cryptosporidium parasites and accidentally swallowing some of it Swimming in contaminated water that contains cryptosporidia Eating uncooked, contaminated food if your hand has been in contact with a contaminated surface, object, person or animal Touching your hand to your mouth If you have a compromised immune system from /, you're more susceptible to illness from cryptosporidium parasites than is a person with a healthy immune system.	general
People with / can develop severe symptoms and a chronic, persistent form of disease that can be difficult to treat.	general
Hardy parasites Cryptosporidium parasites are one of the more common causes of infectious diarrhea in humans.	general
This parasite is difficult to to get rid of because it's resistant to many disinfectants and many filters don't remove it.	general
Cryptosporidia can survive for months at varying temperatures, though the parasite can be destroyed by boiling.	general
Risk factors People who are at increased risk of developing cryptosporidiosis include: Children, particularly those wearing diapers, who attend child care centers Parents of infected children International travelers, especially those traveling to developing countries Backpackers, hikers and campers who drink untreated, unfiltered water Swimmers who swallow water in pools, lakes and rivers People who drink water from shallow, unprotected wells Complications Malnutrition resulting from poor absorption of nutrients from your intestinal tract Severe dehydration Significant weight loss Inflammation of the passage between your liver, gallbladder and small intestine (bile duct) Inflammation of your gallbladder, liver or pancreas Cryptosporidium infection isn't life-threatening.	general
However, if you've had a transplant or if you have a weakened immune system, developing complications can be dangerous.	general
Cryptosporidium infection is contagious, so take precautions to avoid spreading the parasite to other people.	general
There's no vaccine to prevent a cryptosporidium infection.	general
To help prevent cryptosporidium infection: Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water after using the toilet and changing diapers, and before and after eating.	general
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't kill the germs that cause cryptosporidium infection.	general
Practice good hygiene.	general
with uncontaminated water all fruits and vegetables that you will eat raw, and avoid eating food you suspect could be contaminated.	general
If you're traveling in a developing country, avoid uncooked foods.	general
Thoroughly wash if you have a weakened immune system or are traveling in an area with a high risk of infection.	general
Methods include boiling ‚Äî at least one minute at a rolling boil ‚Äî or filtering, although filtering might not be as effective as boiling.	general
Purify drinking water Be sure to use a filter that meets the NSF International standard 53 or 58 requirements for cyst and oocyst reduction.	general
You'll need a separate water filter for bacteria and viruses.	general
during sexual activity.	general
Avoid fecal exposure Always avoid swimming when you have diarrhea.	general
If you know you've had a cryptosporidium infection, don't go swimming for at least two weeks after your symptoms go away because you can still be contagious.	general
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare type of cancer that begins in white blood cells called T cells (T lymphocytes).	general
These cells normally help your body's germ-fighting immune system.	general
In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the T cells develop abnormalities that make them attack the skin.	general
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can cause rash-like skin redness, slightly raised or scaly round patches on the skin, and, sometimes, skin tumors.	general
Several types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma exist.	general
The most common type is mycosis fungoides.	general
Sezary syndrome is a less common type that causes skin redness over the entire body.	general
Some types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as mycosis fungoides, progress slowly and others are more aggressive.	general
The type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma you have helps determine which treatments are best for you.	general
Treatments can include skin creams, light therapy, radiation therapy and systemic medications, such as chemotherapy.	general
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is one of several types of lymphoma collectively called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	general
Signs and symptoms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma include: Round patches of skin that may be raised or scaly and might be itchy Patches of skin that appear lighter in color than surrounding skin Lumps that form on the skin and may break open Enlarged lymph nodes Thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet A rash-like skin redness over the entire body that is intensely itchy The exact cause of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma isn't known.	general
In general, cancer begins when cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA.	general
A cell's DNA contains instructions that tell a cell what to do.	general
The DNA mutations tell the cells to grow and multiply rapidly, creating many abnormal cells.	general
In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the mutations cause too many abnormal T cells that attack the skin.	general
T cells are part of your immune system, and they normally help your body fight germs.	general
Doctors don't know why the cells attack the skin.	general
Peyronie's (pay-roe-NEEZ) disease is a noncancerous condition resulting from fibrous scar tissue that develops on the penis and causes curved, painful erections.	general
Penises vary in shape and size, and having a curved erection isn't necessarily a cause for concern.	general
But Peyronie's disease causes a significant bend or pain in some men.	general
This can prevent you from having sex or might make it difficult to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction).	general
For many men, Peyronie's disease also causes stress and anxiety.	general
Penile shortening is another common concern.	general
Peyronie's disease rarely goes away on its own.	general
In most men with Peyronie's disease, the condition will remain as is or worsen.	general
Early treatment soon after developing the condition may keep it from getting worse or even improve symptoms.	general
Even if you've had the condition for some time, treatment may help improve bothersome symptoms, such as pain, curvature and penile shortening.	general
Peyronie's disease signs and symptoms might appear suddenly or develop gradually.	general
The most common signs and symptoms include: The scar tissue associated with Peyronie's disease ‚Äî called plaque but different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels ‚Äî can be felt under the skin of the penis as flat lumps or a band of hard tissue.	general
Scar tissue.	general
Your penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side.	general
A significant bend to the penis.	general
Peyronie's disease might cause problems getting or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction).	general
But, often men report erectile dysfunction before the beginning of Peyronie's disease symptoms.	general
Erection problems.	general
Your penis might become shorter as a result of Peyronie's disease.	general
Shortening of the penis.	general
You might have penile pain, with or without an erection.	general
In some men with Peyronie's disease, the erect penis might have narrowing, indentations or even an hourglass-like appearance, with a tight, narrow band around the shaft.	general
Other penile deformity.	general
The curvature and penile shortening associated with Peyronie's disease might gradually worsen.	general
At some point, however, the condition typically stabilizes after three to 12 months or so.	general
Pain during erections usually improves within one to two years, but the scar tissue, penile shortening and curvature often remain.	general
In some men, both the curvature and pain associated with Peyronie's disease improve without treatment.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor as soon as possible after you notice signs or symptoms of Peyronie's disease.	general
Early treatment gives you the best chance to improve the condition ‚Äî or prevent it from getting worse.	general
If you've had the condition for some time, you may wish to see a doctor if the pain, curvature, length or other deformities bother you or your partner.	general
Flaccid and erect penis Flaccid and erect penis The penis contains two cylindrical, spongelike structures (corpora cavernosa).	general
When a male becomes sexually aroused, nerve impulses increase blood flow to both cylinders.	general
This sudden influx of blood causes an erection by expanding, straightening and stiffening the penis.	general
The cause of Peyronie's disease isn't completely understood, but a number of factors appear to be involved.	general
It's thought Peyronie's disease generally results from repeated injury to the penis.	general
For example, the penis might be damaged during sex, athletic activity or as the result of an accident.	general
However, most often, no specific trauma to the penis is recalled.	general
During the healing process after injury to the penis, scar tissue forms in a disorganized manner.	general
This can lead to a nodule you can feel or development of curvature.	general
Each side of the penis contains a spongelike tube (corpus cavernosum) that contains many tiny blood vessels.	general
Each of the corpora cavernosa is encased in a sheath of elastic tissue called the tunica albuginea (TOO-nih-kuh al-BYOO-JIN-e-uh), which stretches during an erection.	general
When you become sexually aroused, blood flow to these chambers increases.	general
As the chambers fill with blood, the penis expands, straightens and stiffens into an erection.	general
In Peyronie's disease, when the penis becomes erect, the region with the scar tissue doesn't stretch, and the penis bends or becomes disfigured and possibly painful.	general
In some men, Peyronie's disease comes on gradually and doesn't seem to be related to an injury.	general
Researchers are investigating whether Peyronie's disease might be linked to an inherited trait or certain health conditions.	general
Risk factors Minor injury to the penis doesn't always lead to Peyronie's disease.	general
However, various factors can contribute to poor wound healing and scar tissue buildup that might play a role in Peyronie's disease.	general
These include: If a family member has Peyronie's disease, you have an increased risk of the condition.	general
Men who have certain connective tissue disorders appear to have an increased risk of developing Peyronie's disease.	general
For example, a number of men who have Peyronie's disease also have a cordlike thickening across the palm that causes the fingers to pull inward (Dupuytren's contracture).	general
Connective tissue disorders.	general
Peyronie's disease can occur in men of any age, but the prevalence of the condition increases with age, especially for men in their 50s and 60s.	general
Curvature in younger men is less often due to Peyronie's disease and is more commonly called congenital penile curvature.	general
A small amount of curvature in younger men is normal and not concerning.	general
Other factors ‚Äî including certain health conditions, smoking and some types of prostate surgery ‚Äî might be linked to Peyronie's disease.	general
Viewed from the side, the normal spine takes the form of an elongated S, the upper back bowing outward and the lower back curving slightly inward.	general
Viewed from behind though, the spine should appear as a straight line from the base of the neck to the tailbone.	general
Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine.	general
Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during the growth spurt just before puberty.	general
While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown.	general
About 3% of adolescents have scoliosis.	general
Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some spine deformities continue to get more severe as children grow.	general
Severe scoliosis can be disabling.	general
An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly.	general
Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse.	general
In many cases, no treatment is necessary.	general
Some children will need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening.	general
Others may need surgery to keep the scoliosis from worsening and to straighten severe cases of scoliosis.	general
Uneven shoulders One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other Uneven waist One hip higher than the other If a scoliosis curve gets worse, the spine will also rotate or twist, in addition to curving side to side.	general
This causes the ribs on one side of the body to stick out farther than on the other side.	general
When to see a doctor Go to your doctor if you notice signs or symptoms of scoliosis in your child.	general
Mild curves, however, can develop without the parent or child knowing it because they appear gradually and usually don't cause pain.	general
Occasionally, teachers, friends and sports teammates are the first to notice a child's scoliosis.	general
Doctors don't know what causes the most common type of scoliosis ‚Äî although it appears to involve hereditary factors, because the disorder tends to run in families.	general
Less common types of scoliosis may be caused by: Neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine Injuries to or infections of the spine Risk factors Risk factors for developing the most common type of scoliosis include: Signs and symptoms typically begin during the growth spurt that occurs just prior to puberty.	general
Although both boys and girls develop mild scoliosis at about the same rate, girls have a much higher risk of the curve worsening and requiring treatment.	general
Scoliosis can run in families, but most children with scoliosis don't have a family history of the disease.	general
Family history.	general
Complications While most people with scoliosis have a mild form of the disorder, scoliosis may sometimes cause complications, including: In severe scoliosis, the rib cage may press against the lungs and heart, making it more difficult to breathe and harder for the heart to pump.	general
Lung and heart damage.	general
Adults who had scoliosis as children are more likely to have chronic back pain than are people in the general population.	general
Back problems.	general
As scoliosis worsens, it can cause more noticeable changes ‚Äî including uneven hips and shoulders, prominent ribs, and a shift of the waist and trunk to the side.	general
Individuals with scoliosis often become self-conscious about their appearance.	general
Appearance.	general
Cushing syndrome Cushing syndrome Left untreated, Cushing syndrome can result in exaggerated facial roundness, weight gain around the midsection and upper back, thinning of your arms and legs, easy bruising and stretch marks.	general
Cushing syndrome occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol for a long time.	general
Cushing syndrome, sometimes called hypercortisolism, may be caused by the use of oral corticosteroid medication.	general
The condition can also occur when your body makes too much cortisol on its own.	general
Too much cortisol can produce some of the hallmark signs of Cushing syndrome ‚Äî a fatty hump between your shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on your skin.	general
Cushing syndrome can also result in high blood pressure, bone loss and, on occasion, type 2 diabetes.	general
Treatments for Cushing syndrome can return your body's cortisol production to normal and noticeably improve your symptoms.	general
The earlier treatment begins, the better your chances for recovery.	general
The signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome can vary depending on the levels of excess cortisol.	general
Common signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits, particularly around the midsection and upper back, in the face (moon face), and between the shoulders (buffalo hump) Pink or purple stretch marks (striae) on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, breasts and arms Thinning, fragile skin that bruises easily Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections Irregular or absent menstrual periods Signs and symptoms men with Cushing syndrome may experience Decreased libido Decreased fertility Erectile dysfunction Other signs and symptoms that may occur with Cushing syndrome Severe fatigue Muscle weakness Bone loss, leading to fractures over time In children, impaired growth When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if you have symptoms that suggest Cushing syndrome, especially if you're taking corticosteroid medication to treat a condition, such as asthma, arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease.	general
The endocrine system includes the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, pancreas, ovaries (in women) and testicles (in men).	general
Excess levels of the hormone cortisol are responsible for Cushing syndrome.	general
Cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal glands, plays a variety of roles in your body.	general
For example, cortisol helps regulate your blood pressure, reduces inflammation, and keeps your heart and blood vessels functioning normally.	general
Cortisol helps your body respond to stress.	general
It also regulates the way you convert (metabolize) proteins, carbohydrates and fats in your diet into usable energy.	general
However, when the level of cortisol is too high in your body, you may develop Cushing syndrome.	general
The role of corticosteroid medications Cushing syndrome can develop from a cause outside of your body (exogenous Cushing syndrome).	general
One example is taking oral corticosteroid medications in high doses over an extended period of time.	general
These medications, such as prednisone, have the same effect in the body as does cortisol produced by your body.	general
Oral corticosteroids may be necessary to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and asthma.	general
It may also be used to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted organ.	general
Because the doses required to treat these conditions are often higher than the amount of cortisol your body normally needs each day, side effects from excess cortisol can occur.	general
It's also possible to develop Cushing syndrome from injectable corticosteroids ‚Äî for example, repeated injections for joint pain, bursitis and back pain.	general
Inhaled steroid medicines (taken for asthma) and steroid skin creams (used for skin disorders such as eczema) are generally less likely to cause Cushing syndrome than are oral corticosteroids.	general
But, in some individuals, these medications may cause Cushing syndrome, especially if taken in high doses.	general
Your body's own overproduction The condition may also be due to your body's own overproduction of cortisol (endogenous Cushing syndrome).	general
This may occur from excess production by one or both adrenal glands, or overproduction of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which normally regulates cortisol production.	general
A noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, produces an excess amount of , which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to make more cortisol.	general
When this form of the syndrome develops, it's called Cushing disease.	general
It occurs much more often in women and is the most common form of endogenous Cushing syndrome.	general
A pituitary gland tumor (pituitary adenoma).	general
Rarely, a tumor that develops in an organ that normally does not produce will begin to secrete this hormone in excess, resulting in Cushing syndrome.	general
These tumors, which can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant), are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland.	general
An -secreting tumor.	general
In some people, the cause of Cushing syndrome is excess cortisol secretion that doesn't depend on stimulation from and is associated with disorders of the adrenal glands.	general
The most common of these disorders is a noncancerous tumor of the adrenal cortex, called an adrenal adenoma.	general
A primary adrenal gland disease.	general
Cancerous tumors of the adrenal cortex (adrenocortical carcinomas) are rare, but they can cause Cushing syndrome as well.	general
Occasionally, benign, nodular enlargement of both adrenal glands can result in Cushing syndrome.	general
Rarely, people inherit a tendency to develop tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, affecting cortisol levels and causing Cushing syndrome.	general
Familial Cushing syndrome.	general
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a rare type of skin cancer that may form as a nodule that appears the same color as your skin.	general
The nodule can also appear pink or purple.	general
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells and attacks the skin.	general
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma begins in the B cells ‚Äî one type of disease-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes.	general
The types of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma include: Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type Intravascular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma may form as a nodule under the skin that may be the same color as your skin or may appear pink or purple.	general
Tests and procedures used to diagnose cutaneous B-cell lymphoma include: Your doctor will carefully examine your skin and look for other signs that may give clues about your diagnosis, such as swollen lymph nodes.	general
Physical exam.	general
Your doctor will remove a small portion of the skin lesion to look for lymphoma cells.	general
Skin biopsy.	general
A sample of your blood may be analyzed to look for lymphoma cells.	general
Blood tests.	general
A sample of your bone marrow may be tested to look for lymphoma cells.	general
Bone marrow biopsy.	general
I Imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) scan and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, may help your doctor assess your condition.	general
maging tests.	general
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma treatment depends on the specific type of lymphoma that you have.	general
Treatment options may include: If you have one or only a few areas of cutaneous lymphoma, your doctor may recommend a procedure to remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue that surrounds it.	general
Surgery may be your only treatment or your doctor may recommend additional treatments.	general
Surgery to remove the cancer.	general
Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells.	general
Radiation therapy can be used alone to treat cutaneous lymphoma, or it may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells.	general
Chemotherapy medications can be injected into the tumor through the skin to treat cutaneous lymphoma.	general
For more advanced cutaneous lymphomas, you may receive chemotherapy as an infusion into a vein.	general
Chemotherapy may be an option if your cutaneous lymphoma is aggressive or advanced.	general
Chemotherapy.	general
Nonsuicidal self-injury, often simply called self-injury, is the act of deliberately harming your own body, such as cutting or burning yourself.	general
It's typically not meant as a suicide attempt.	general
Rather, this type of self-injury is a harmful way to cope with emotional pain, intense anger and frustration.	general
While self-injury may bring a momentary sense of calm and a release of tension, it's usually followed by guilt and shame and the return of painful emotions.	general
Although life-threatening injuries are usually not intended, with self-injury comes the possibility of more-serious and even fatal self-aggressive actions.	general
Getting appropriate treatment can help you learn healthier ways to cope.	general
Scars, often in patterns Keeping sharp objects on hand Wearing long sleeves or long pants, even in hot weather Frequent reports of accidental injury Difficulties in interpersonal relationships Statements of helplessness, hopelessness or worthlessness Forms of self-injury Self-injury usually occurs in private and is done in a controlled or ritualistic manner that often leaves a pattern on the skin.	general
Examples of self-harm include: Cutting (cuts or severe scratches with a sharp object) Burning (with lit matches, cigarettes or heated, sharp objects such as knives) Carving words or symbols on the skin Self-hitting, punching or head banging Piercing the skin with sharp objects Inserting objects under the skin Most frequently, the arms, legs and front of the torso are the targets of self-injury, but any area of the body may be used for self-injury.	general
People who self-injure may use more than one method to harm themselves.	general
Becoming upset can trigger an urge to self-injure.	general
Many people self-injure only a few times and then stop.	general
But for others, self-injury can become a long-term, repetitive behavior.	general
When to see a doctor If you're injuring yourself, even in a minor way, or if you have thoughts of harming yourself, reach out for help.	general
Any form of self-injury is a sign of bigger issues that need to be addressed.	general
Talk to someone you trust ‚Äî such as a friend, loved one, doctor, spiritual leader, or a school counselor, nurse or teacher ‚Äî who can help you take the first steps to successful treatment.	general
While you may feel ashamed and embarrassed about your behavior, you can find supportive, caring and nonjudgmental help.	general
When a friend or loved one self-injures If you have a friend or loved one who is self-injuring, you may be shocked and scared.	general
Take all talk of self-injury seriously.	general
Although you might feel that you'd be betraying a confidence, self-injury is too big a problem to ignore or to deal with alone.	general
Here are some ways to help.	general
You can start by consulting your pediatrician or other health care provider who can provide an initial evaluation or a referral to a mental health professional.	general
Express your concern, but don't yell at your child or make threats or accusations.	general
Your child.	general
Suggest that your friend talk to parents, a teacher, a school counselor or another trusted adult.	general
Preteen or teenage friend.	general
Gently express your concern and encourage the person to seek medical and mental health treatment.	general
When to get emergency help If you've injured yourself severely or believe your injury may be life-threatening, or if you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.	general
Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your mental health professional if you're seeing one.	general
Call a suicide hotline.	general
In the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or use their webchat on suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat.	general
Seek help from your school nurse or counselor, teacher, doctor, or other health care provider.	general
Reach out to a close friend or loved one.	general
Contact a spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.	general
There's no one single or simple cause that leads someone to self-injure.	general
In general, self-injury may result from: Nonsuicidal self-injury is usually the result of an inability to cope in healthy ways with psychological pain.	general
Poor coping skills.	general
The person has a hard time regulating, expressing or understanding emotions.	general
The mix of emotions that triggers self-injury is complex.	general
For instance, there may be feelings of worthlessness, loneliness, panic, anger, guilt, rejection, self-hatred or confused sexuality Difficulty managing emotions.	general
Through self-injury, the person may be trying to: Manage or reduce severe distress or anxiety and provide a sense of relief Provide a distraction from painful emotions through physical pain Feel a sense of control over his or her body, feelings, or life situations Feel something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî even if it's physical pain, when feeling emotionally empty Express internal feelings in an external way Communicate depression or distressful feelings to the outside world Be punished for perceived faults Risk factors Most people who self-injure are teenagers and young adults, although those in other age groups also self-injure.	general
Self-injury often starts in the preteen or early teen years, when emotions are more volatile and teens face increasing peer pressure, loneliness, and conflicts with parents or other authority figures.	general
Certain factors may increase the risk of self-injury, including: People who have friends who intentionally harm themselves are more likely to begin self-injuring.	general
Having friends who self-injure.	general
Some people who injure themselves were neglected, were sexually, physically or emotionally abused, or experienced other traumatic events.	general
They may have grown up and still remain in an unstable family environment, or they may be young people questioning their personal identity or sexuality.	general
Some people who self-injure are socially isolated.	general
Life issues.	general
People who self-injure are more likely to be highly self-critical and be poor problem-solvers.	general
In addition, self-injury is commonly associated with certain mental disorders, such as borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders.	general
Mental health issues.	general
People who harm themselves often do so while under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs.	general
Alcohol or drug use.	general
Complications Permanent scars or disfigurement Severe, possibly fatal injury Worsening of underlying issues and disorders, if not adequately treated Suicide risk Although self-injury is not usually a suicide attempt, it can increase the risk of suicide because of the emotional problems that trigger self-injury.	general
And the pattern of damaging the body in times of distress can make suicide more likely.	general
There is no sure way to prevent your loved one's self-injuring behavior.	general
But reducing the risk of self-injury includes strategies that involve both individuals and communities.	general
Parents, family members, teachers, school nurses, coaches or friends can help.	general
Someone at risk can be taught resilience and healthy coping skills that can be used during periods of distress.	general
Identify someone at risk and offer help.	general
Many people who self-injure feel lonely and disconnected.	general
Helping someone form connections to people who don't self-injure can improve relationship and communication skills.	general
Encourage expansion of social networks.	general
Learn about the warning signs of self-injury and what to do when you suspect it.	general
Raise awareness.	general
Peers tend to be loyal to friends.	general
Encourage children, teens and young adults to avoid secrecy and reach out for help if they have a concern about a friend or loved one.	general
Encourage peers to seek help.	general
News media, music and other highly visible outlets that feature self-injury may nudge vulnerable children and young adults to experiment.	general
Teaching children critical thinking skills about the influences around them might reduce the harmful impact.	general
Talk about media influence.	general
Cyclic vomiting syndrome is characterized by episodes of severe vomiting that have no apparent cause.	general
Episodes can last for hours or days and alternate with symptom-free periods.	general
Episodes are similar, meaning that they tend to start at the same time of day, last the same length of time, and occur with the same symptoms and intensity.	general
Cyclic vomiting syndrome occurs in all age groups, though it often begins in children around 3 to 7 years old.	general
Although it's more common in children, the number of cases diagnosed in adults is increasing.	general
The syndrome is difficult to diagnose because vomiting is a symptom of many disorders.	general
Treatment often involves lifestyle changes to help prevent the events that can trigger vomiting episodes.	general
Medications, including anti-nausea and migraine therapies, may help lessen symptoms.	general
The symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome often begin in the morning.	general
Signs and symptoms include: Three or more recurrent episodes of vomiting that start around the same time and last for a similar length of time Varying intervals of generally normal health without nausea between episodes Intense nausea and sweating before an episode starts Other signs and symptoms during a vomiting episode may include: Abdominal pain When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you see blood in your or your child's vomit.	general
Continued vomiting may cause severe dehydration that can be life-threatening.	general
Call your doctor if you or your child is showing symptoms of dehydration, such as: Excess thirst or dry mouth Less urination The underlying cause of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown.	general
Some possible causes include genes, digestive difficulties, nervous system problems and hormone imbalances.	general
Specific bouts of vomiting may be triggered by: Colds, allergies or sinus problems Emotional stress or excitement, especially in children Anxiety or panic attacks, especially in adults Certain foods and drinks, such as alcohol, caffeine, chocolate or cheese Overeating, eating right before going to bed or fasting Hot weather Physical exhaustion Motion sickness Identifying the triggers for vomiting episodes may help with managing cyclic vomiting syndrome.	general
Risk factors The relationship between migraines and cyclic vomiting syndrome isn't clear.	general
But many children with cyclic vomiting syndrome have a family history of migraines or have migraines themselves when they get older.	general
In adults, the association between cyclic vomiting syndrome and migraine may be lower.	general
Chronic use of marijuana (Cannabis sativa) also has been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome because some people use marijuana to relieve their nausea.	general
However, chronic marijuana use can lead to a condition called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, which typically leads to persistent vomiting without normal intervening periods.	general
People with this syndrome often demonstrate frequent showering or bathing behavior.	general
Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome can be confused with cyclic vomiting syndrome.	general
To rule out cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, you need to stop using marijuana for at least one to two weeks to see if vomiting lessens.	general
If it doesn't, your doctor will continue testing for cyclic vomiting syndrome.	general
Complications Cyclic vomiting syndrome can cause these complications: Excessive vomiting causes the body to lose water quickly.	general
Severe cases of dehydration may need to be treated in the hospital.	general
Dehydration.	general
The stomach acid that comes up with the vomit can damage the tube that connects the mouth and stomach (esophagus).	general
Sometimes the esophagus becomes so irritated it bleeds.	general
Injury to the food tube.	general
The acid in vomit can corrode tooth enamel.	general
Tooth decay.	general
Many people know what triggers their cyclic vomiting episodes.	general
Avoiding those triggers can reduce the frequency of episodes.	general
While you may feel well between episodes, it's very important to take medications as prescribed by your doctor.	general
If episodes occur more than once a month or require hospitalization, your doctor may recommend preventive medicine, such as amitriptyline, propranolol (Inderal), cyproheptadine and topiramate.	general
Cyclospora infection (cyclosporiasis) causes watery, and sometimes explosive, diarrhea.	general
The one-celled parasite that causes cyclospora infection can enter your body when you ingest contaminated food or water.	general
Fresh produce is the culprit in many cases of cyclospora infection.	general
Because diarrhea can be caused by many things, it can be difficult to diagnose cyclospora infection unless a specialized stool test is done.	general
Treatment for cyclospora infection is antibiotics.	general
Food safety precautions may help prevent the disease.	general
Some people infected with the microscopic parasite that causes cyclospora infection develop no signs or symptoms.	general
For others, signs and symptoms ‚Äî which usually begin within two to 11 days of eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water ‚Äî may include: Frequent, watery diarrhea Loss of appetite and weight loss Bloating, flatulence and burping Fatigue ‚Äî this symptom may last long after the active infection has gotten better General feeling of unwellness (malaise) The diarrhea may end by itself within a few days, or it may last for weeks.	general
If you have HIV or another condition that compromises your immune system, the infection can last for months if not treated.	general
When to see a doctor Many conditions can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal signs and symptoms.	general
If you develop persistent diarrhea that lasts several days or recurs, contact your doctor so that he or she can identify the cause and recommend treatment.	general
If you've eaten a food that's been recalled because of a cyclospora outbreak or traveled in an area where parasites such as cyclospora are common, be sure to tell your doctor.	general
If you experience dehydration due to diarrhea, see your doctor.	general
Warning signs of dehydration include: Sunken eyes A one-celled parasite, Cyclospora cayetanensis, causes cyclospora infection.	general
You get it by drinking water or eating food that's been contaminated by a person infected with the parasite.	general
A person infected with cyclospora passes the parasite in stool.	general
However, unlike some other foodborne parasites, cyclospora doesn't become infectious until days or weeks after it's passed in a bowel movement.	general
So it's unlikely that you can get the infection directly from a person infected with cyclospora, such as a restaurant worker who doesn't wash his or her hands adequately after using the toilet.	general
Before the 1990s, sporadic cases of cyclospora infection turned up only in people who traveled in developing countries and in those with HIV or another condition that caused a weakened immune system.	general
However, since the 1990s, lettuce, fresh basil and imported raspberries have been implicated in cyclospora outbreaks in the United States and Canada.	general
Risk factors In the past, people who traveled in developing countries were more likely to get cyclospora infection.	general
These days, the infection is found worldwide, and anyone who ingests contaminated food or water can get it.	general
Complications The prolonged diarrhea of untreated cyclospora infection can cause dehydration.	general
If you're an otherwise healthy adult, you can treat dehydration by drinking more fluids.	general
Some people may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous fluids because they're at higher risk of severe dehydration.	general
Examples include: People with other serious illnesses Infants and young children When traveling to developing nations, it's essential to be careful about what you eat and drink.	general
However, recent cyclospora infection outbreaks have been linked to foods imported to or grown in the United States and Canada.	general
Unfortunately, even careful washing of foods isn't enough to eliminate the parasite that causes the infection.	general
To keep track of what foods have been linked to recent outbreaks of cyclospora infection, you may want to periodically check the food safety alert section of the Food and Drug Administration's website.	general
Cyclothymia (sy-kloe-THIE-me-uh), also called cyclothymic disorder, is a rare mood disorder.	general
Cyclothymia causes emotional ups and downs, but they're not as extreme as those in bipolar I or II disorder.	general
With cyclothymia, you experience periods when your mood noticeably shifts up and down from your baseline.	general
You may feel on top of the world for a time, followed by a low period when you feel somewhat down.	general
Between these cyclothymic highs and lows, you may feel stable and fine.	general
Although the highs and lows of cyclothymia are less extreme than those of bipolar disorder, it's critical to seek help managing these symptoms because they can interfere with your ability to function and increase your risk of bipolar I or II disorder.	general
Treatment options for cyclothymia include talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications and close, ongoing follow-up with your doctor.	general
Cyclothymia symptoms alternate between emotional highs and lows.	general
The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms).	general
The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms.	general
Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe.	general
When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well.	general
The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel.	general
Hypomanic symptoms Signs and symptoms of the highs of cyclothymia may include: An exaggerated feeling of happiness or well-being (euphoria) Extreme optimism Inflated self-esteem Talking more than usual Poor judgment that can result in risky behavior or unwise choices Racing thoughts Excessive physical activity Increased drive to perform or achieve goals (sexual, work related or social) Decreased need for sleep Inability to concentrate Signs and symptoms of the lows of cyclothymia may include: Feeling sad, hopeless or empty Tearfulness Loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable Changes in weight Sleep problems Problems concentrating Thinking of death or suicide When to see a doctor If you have any symptoms of cyclothymia, seek medical help as soon as possible.	general
Cyclothymia generally doesn't get better on its own.	general
If you're reluctant to seek treatment, work up the courage to confide in someone who can help you take that first step.	general
If a loved one has symptoms of cyclothymia, talk openly and honestly with that person about your concerns.	general
You can't force someone to seek professional help, but you can offer support and help find a qualified doctor or mental health provider.	general
Suicidal thoughts Although suicidal thoughts might occur with cyclothymia, they're more likely to occur if you have bipolar I or II disorder.	general
If you're considering suicide right now: Call 911 or your local emergency services number, or go to a hospital emergency department.	general
Call a local crisis center or suicide hotline number ‚Äî in the United States, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor.	general
"Use that same number and press ""1"" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line."	general
If you just can't make that call, reach out to someone else ‚Äî immediately ‚Äî such as your doctor, mental health provider, family member, friend or someone in your faith community.	general
It's not known specifically what causes cyclothymia.	general
As with many mental health disorders, research shows that it may result from a combination of: as cyclothymia tends to run in families such as changes in the brain's neurobiology Differences in the way the brain works, such as traumatic experiences or prolonged periods of stress Environment, Risk factors Cyclothymia is thought to be relatively rare.	general
But true estimates are hard to pin down because people may be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as having other mood disorders, such as depression.	general
Cyclothymia typically starts during the teenage years or young adulthood.	general
It affects about the same number of males and females.	general
Complications If you have cyclothymia: Not treating it can result in significant emotional problems that affect every area of your life There is a high risk of later developing bipolar I or II disorder Substance misuse is common You may also have an anxiety disorder You may be at increased risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide There's no sure way to prevent cyclothymia.	general
However, treatment at the earliest indication of a mental health disorder can help prevent cyclothymia from worsening.	general
Long-term preventive treatment also can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of hypomania, mania or major depression.	general
Ganglion cyst Ganglion cyst Ganglion cysts are lumps that most commonly develop in the wrist.	general
They're typically round or oval and are filled with a jelly-like fluid.	general
Ganglion cysts are noncancerous lumps that most commonly develop along the tendons or joints of your wrists or hands.	general
They also may occur in the ankles and feet.	general
Ganglion cysts are typically round or oval and are filled with a jellylike fluid.	general
Small ganglion cysts can be pea-sized, while larger ones can be around an inch (2.	general
5 centimeters) in diameter.	general
Ganglion cysts can be painful if they press on a nearby nerve.	general
Their location can sometimes interfere with joint movement.	general
If your ganglion cyst is causing you problems, your doctor may suggest trying to drain the cyst with a needle.	general
Removing the cyst surgically also is an option.	general
But if you have no symptoms, no treatment is necessary.	general
In many cases, the cysts go away on their own.	general
The lumps associated with ganglion cysts can be characterized by: Ganglion cysts most commonly develop along the tendons or joints of your wrists or hands.	general
The next most common locations are the ankles and feet.	general
These cysts can occur near other joints as well.	general
Ganglion cysts are round or oval and usually measure less than an inch (2.	general
5 centimeters) in diameter.	general
Some are so small that they can't be felt.	general
The size of a cyst can fluctuate, often getting larger when you use that joint for repetitive motions.	general
Shape and size.	general
Ganglion cysts usually are painless.	general
But if a cyst presses on a nerve ‚Äî even if the cyst is too small to form a noticeable lump ‚Äî it can cause pain, tingling, numbness or muscle weakness.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience a noticeable lump or pain in your wrist, hand, ankle or foot.	general
He or she can make a diagnosis and determine whether you need treatment.	general
No one knows exactly what causes a ganglion cyst to develop.	general
It grows out of a joint or the lining of a tendon, looking like a tiny water balloon on a stalk, and seems to occur when the tissue that surrounds a joint or a tendon bulges out of place.	general
Inside the cyst is a thick lubricating fluid similar to that found in joints or around tendons.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of ganglion cysts include: Ganglion cysts can develop in anyone, but they most commonly occur in women between the ages of 20 and 40.	general
Your sex and age.	general
People who have wear-and-tear arthritis in the finger joints closest to their fingernails are at higher risk of developing ganglion cysts near those joints.	general
Osteoarthritis.	general
Joints or tendons that have been injured in the past are more likely to develop ganglion cysts.	general
Joint or tendon injury.	general
Kidney cyst Kidney cyst A kidney cyst is a round or oval fluid-filled pouch with a well-defined outline.	general
Kidney cysts typically grow on the surface of a kidney, although some may develop inside your kidney.	general
Kidney cysts are round pouches of fluid that form on or in the kidneys.	general
Kidney cysts can be associated with serious disorders that may impair kidney function.	general
But more commonly, kidney cysts are a type called simple kidney cysts ‚Äî noncancerous cysts that rarely cause complications.	general
It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts.	general
Typically, only one cyst occurs on the surface of a kidney, but multiple cysts can affect one or both kidneys.	general
However, simple kidney cysts aren't the same as the cysts that form with polycystic kidney disease.	general
Simple kidney cysts are often detected during an imaging test performed for another condition.	general
Simple kidney cysts that don't cause signs or symptoms usually don't require treatment.	general
Simple kidney cysts typically don't cause signs or symptoms.	general
If a simple kidney cyst grows large enough, symptoms may include: Dull pain in your back or side When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of a kidney cyst.	general
It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts.	general
One theory suggests that kidney cysts develop when the surface layer of the kidney weakens and forms a pouch (diverticulum).	general
The pouch then fills with fluid, detaches and develops into a cyst.	general
Risk factors The risk of having simple kidney cysts increases as you get older, though they can occur at any age.	general
Simple kidney cysts are more common in men.	general
Complications Kidney cysts can occasionally lead to complications, including: A kidney cyst may become infected, causing fever and pain.	general
An infected cyst.	general
A kidney cyst that bursts causes severe pain in your back or side.	general
A burst cyst.	general
A kidney cyst that obstructs the normal flow of urine may lead to swelling of the kidney (hydronephrosis).	general
Urine obstruction.	general
Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.	general
Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs or pockets in an ovary or on its surface.	general
Women have two ovaries ‚Äî each about the size and shape of an almond ‚Äî on each side of the uterus.	general
Eggs (ova), which develop and mature in the ovaries, are released in monthly cycles during the childbearing years.	general
Many women have ovarian cysts at some time.	general
Most ovarian cysts present little or no discomfort and are harmless.	general
The majority disappears without treatment within a few months.	general
However, ovarian cysts ‚Äî especially those that have ruptured ‚Äî can cause serious symptoms.	general
To protect your health, get regular pelvic exams and know the symptoms that can signal a potentially serious problem.	general
Most cysts don't cause symptoms and go away on their own.	general
However, a large ovarian cyst can cause: Pelvic pain ‚Äî a dull or sharp ache in the lower abdomen on the side of the cyst Fullness or heaviness in your abdomen Seek immediate medical attention if you have: Sudden, severe abdominal or pelvic pain Pain with fever or vomiting If you have these signs and symptoms or those of shock ‚Äî cold, clammy skin; rapid breathing; and lightheadedness or weakness ‚Äî see a doctor right away.	general
Follicular cyst Follicular cyst A follicular cyst occurs when the follicle of the ovary doesn't rupture or release its egg.	general
Instead, it grows until it becomes a cyst.	general
Corpus luteum cyst Corpus luteum cyst Abnormal changes in the follicle of the ovary after an egg has been released can cause the egg's escape opening to seal off.	general
Fluid accumulates inside the follicle, and a corpus luteum cyst develops.	general
Most ovarian cysts develop as a result of your menstrual cycle (functional cysts).	general
Other types of cysts are much less common.	general
Functional cysts Your ovaries normally grow cyst-like structures called follicles each month.	general
Follicles produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone and release an egg when you ovulate.	general
If a normal monthly follicle keeps growing, it's known as a functional cyst.	general
There are two types of functional cysts: Around the midpoint of your menstrual cycle, an egg bursts out of its follicle and travels down the fallopian tube.	general
A follicular cyst begins when the follicle doesn't rupture or release its egg, but continues to grow.	general
Follicular cyst.	general
When a follicle releases its egg, it begins producing estrogen and progesterone for conception.	general
This follicle is now called the corpus luteum.	general
Sometimes, fluid accumulates inside the follicle, causing the corpus luteum to grow into a cyst.	general
Corpus luteum cyst.	general
Functional cysts are usually harmless, rarely cause pain, and often disappear on their own within two or three menstrual cycles.	general
Other cysts Types of cysts not related to the normal function of your menstrual cycle include: Also called teratomas, these can contain tissue, such as hair, skin or teeth, because they form from embryonic cells.	general
They're rarely cancerous.	general
Dermoid cysts.	general
These develop on the surface of an ovary and might be filled with a watery or a mucous material.	general
Cystadenomas.	general
These develop as a result of a condition in which uterine endometrial cells grow outside your uterus (endometriosis).	general
Some of the tissue can attach to your ovary and form a growth.	general
Endometriomas.	general
Dermoid cysts and cystadenomas can become large, causing the ovary to move out of position.	general
This increases the chance of painful twisting of your ovary, called ovarian torsion.	general
Ovarian torsion may also result in decreasing or stopping blood flow to the ovary.	general
Video: Ovulation Show transcript for video Video: Ovulation Ovulation is the release of an egg from one of the ovaries.	general
It often happens about midway through the menstrual cycle, although the exact timing may vary.	general
In preparation for ovulation, the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, thickens.	general
The pituitary gland in the brain stimulates one of the ovaries to release an egg.	general
The wall of the ovarian follicle ruptures at the surface of the ovary.	general
The egg is released.	general
Finger-like structures called fimbriae sweep the egg into the neighboring fallopian tube.	general
The egg travels through the fallopian tube, propelled in part by contractions in the fallopian tube walls.	general
Here in the fallopian tube, the egg may be fertilized by a sperm.	general
If the egg is fertilized, the egg and sperm unite to form a one-celled entity called a zygote.	general
As the zygote travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, it begins dividing rapidly to form a cluster of cells called a blastocyst, which resembles a tiny raspberry.	general
When the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it implants in the lining of the uterus and pregnancy begins.	general
If the egg isn't fertilized, it's simply reabsorbed by the body ‚Äî perhaps before it even reaches the uterus.	general
About two weeks later, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina.	general
This is known as menstruation.	general
Risk factors Your risk of developing an ovarian cyst is heightened by: These include taking the fertility drug clomiphene (Clomid), which is used to cause you to ovulate.	general
Hormonal problems.	general
Sometimes, the cyst that forms when you ovulate stays on your ovary throughout your pregnancy.	general
This condition causes uterine endometrial cells to grow outside your uterus.	general
Some of the tissue can attach to your ovary and form a growth.	general
Endometriosis.	general
If the infection spreads to the ovaries, it can cause cysts.	general
A severe pelvic infection.	general
If you've had one, you're likely to develop more.	general
A previous ovarian cyst.	general
Complications Some women develop less common types of cysts that a doctor finds during a pelvic exam.	general
Cystic ovarian masses that develop after menopause might be cancerous (malignant).	general
That's why it's important to have regular pelvic exams.	general
Infrequent complications associated with ovarian cysts include: Cysts that enlarge can cause the ovary to move, increasing the chance of painful twisting of your ovary (ovarian torsion).	general
Symptoms can include an abrupt onset of severe pelvic pain, nausea and vomiting.	general
Ovarian torsion can also decrease or stop blood flow to the ovaries.	general
Ovarian torsion.	general
A cyst that ruptures can cause severe pain and internal bleeding.	general
The larger the cyst, the greater the risk of rupture.	general
Vigorous activity that affects the pelvis, such as vaginal intercourse, also increases the risk.	general
More Information Although there's no way to prevent ovarian cysts, regular pelvic examinations help ensure that changes in your ovaries are diagnosed as early as possible.	general
Be alert to changes in your monthly cycle, including unusual menstrual symptoms, especially ones that persist for more than a few cycles.	general
Talk to your doctor about changes that concern you.	general
The pancreas is a large organ that lies horizontally in your upper abdomen behind your stomach.	general
Types of pancreatic cysts Types of pancreatic cysts Many kinds of cysts can grow on the pancreas, some cancerous and some benign.	general
Pancreatic cysts are saclike pockets of fluid on or in your pancreas, a large organ behind the stomach that produces hormones and enzymes that help digest food.	general
Most pancreatic cysts aren't cancerous, and many don't cause symptoms.	general
They're typically found during imaging testing for another problem.	general
Some are actually noncancerous (benign) pockets of fluids lined with scar or inflammatory tissue, not the type of cells found in true cysts (pseudocysts).	general
But some pancreatic cysts can be or can become cancerous.	general
Your doctor might take a sample of the pancreatic cyst fluid to determine if cancer cells are present.	general
Or your doctor might recommend monitoring a cyst over time for changes that indicate cancer.	general
You may not have symptoms from pancreatic cysts, which are often found when imaging tests of the abdomen are done for another reason.	general
When signs or symptoms of pancreatic cysts do occur, they typically include: Persistent abdominal pain, which may radiate to your back A mass you can feel in your upper abdomen Nausea and vomiting When to see a doctor Rarely, cysts can become infected.	general
See a doctor if you have a fever and persistent abdominal pain.	general
A ruptured pseudocyst can be a medical emergency, but fortunately is rare.	general
Fluid released by the pseudocyst can damage nearby blood vessels and cause massive bleeding.	general
A ruptured pseudocyst can also cause infection of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis).	general
Seek emergency medical treatment if you have signs or symptoms of internal bleeding and shock, including: The cause of most pancreatic cysts is unknown.	general
Some cysts are associated with rare illnesses including von Hippel-Lindau disease, a genetic disorder that can affect the pancreas and other organs.	general
Pseudocysts often follow a bout of a painful condition in which digestive enzymes become prematurely active and irritate the pancreas (pancreatitis).	general
Pseudocysts can also result from injury to the abdomen, such as from a car accident.	general
Risk factors Heavy alcohol use and gallstones are risk factors for pancreatitis, and pancreatitis is a risk factor for pseudocysts.	general
Abdominal injury is also a risk factor for pseudocysts.	general
The best way to avoid pseudocysts is to avoid pancreatitis, which is usually caused by gallstones or heavy alcohol use.	general
If gallstones are triggering pancreatitis, you may need to have your gallbladder removed.	general
If your pancreatitis is due to alcohol use, not drinking can reduce your risk.	general
Pilonidal cyst Pilonidal cyst A pilonidal cyst is an abnormal pocket in the skin that usually contains hair and skin debris.	general
A pilonidal cyst is almost always located near the tailbone at the top of the cleft of the buttocks.	general
A pilonidal (pie-low-NIE-dul) cyst is an abnormal pocket in the skin that usually contains hair and skin debris.	general
A pilonidal cyst is almost always located near the tailbone at the top of the cleft of the buttocks.	general
Pilonidal cysts usually occur when hair punctures the skin and then becomes embedded.	general
If a pilonidal cyst becomes infected, the resulting abscess is often extremely painful.	general
The cyst can be drained through a small incision or removed surgically.	general
Pilonidal cysts most commonly occur in young men, and the problem has a tendency to recur.	general
People who sit for prolonged periods of time, such as truck drivers, are at higher risk of developing a pilonidal cyst.	general
When it's infected, a pilonidal cyst becomes a swollen mass (abscess).	general
Signs and symptoms of an infected pilonidal cyst include: Reddening of the skin Drainage of pus or blood from an opening in the skin Foul smell from draining pus When to see a doctor If you notice any signs or symptoms of a pilonidal cyst, see your doctor.	general
He or she can diagnose the condition by examining the lesion.	general
The exact cause of pilonidal cysts isn't clear.	general
But most pilonidal cysts appear to be caused by loose hairs that penetrate the skin.	general
Friction and pressure ‚Äî skin rubbing against skin, tight clothing, bicycling, long periods of sitting or similar factors ‚Äî force the hair down into skin.	general
Responding to the hair as a foreign substance, the body creates a cyst around the hair.	general
This explanation accounts for rare cases of pilonidal cysts that occur in parts of the body other than near the tailbone.	general
For example, barbers, dog groomers and sheep shearers have developed pilonidal cysts in the skin between fingers.	general
Risk factors Certain factors can make you more susceptible to developing pilonidal cysts, such as: Younger age (pilonidal cysts are most common in people in their 20s) Complications If a chronically infected pilonidal cyst isn't treated properly, you may be at slightly increased risk of developing a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.	general
Keep the area clean Lose weight if needed Avoid prolonged sitting If you've had pilonidal cysts in the past, you might want to regularly shave the area or use hair removal products to reduce the risk of recurrence.	general
Spermatocele Spermatocele A spermatocele, also known as a spermatic cyst, is a typically painless, noncancerous (benign), fluid-filled sac that grows near the top of a testicle.	general
A spermatocele (SPUR-muh-toe-seel) is an abnormal sac (cyst) that develops in the epididymis ‚Äî the small, coiled tube located on the upper testicle that collects and transports sperm.	general
Noncancerous and generally painless, a spermatocele usually is filled with milky or clear fluid that might contain sperm.	general
The exact cause of spermatoceles isn't clear, but they might be due to a blockage in one of the tubes that transport sperm.	general
Spermatoceles, sometimes called spermatic cysts, are common.	general
They typically don't reduce fertility or require treatment.	general
If a spermatocele grows large enough to cause discomfort, your doctor might suggest surgery.	general
A spermatocele usually causes no signs or symptoms and might remain stable in size.	general
If it becomes large enough, however, you might feel: Pain or discomfort in the affected testicle Heaviness in the testicle with the spermatocele Fullness behind and above the testicle When to see a doctor Because a spermatocele usually doesn't cause symptoms, you might discover it only during a testicular self-exam, or your doctor might find it during a routine physical exam.	general
It's a good idea to have your doctor evaluate any scrotal mass to rule out a serious condition, such as testicular cancer.	general
Also, call your doctor if you experience pain or swelling in your scrotum.	general
A number of conditions can cause testicular pain, and some require immediate treatment.	general
The cause of spermatoceles is unknown.	general
Spermatoceles might result from a blockage in one of the multiple tubes within the epididymis that transport and store sperm from the testicle.	general
Risk factors There aren't many known risk factors for developing a spermatocele.	general
Men whose mothers were given the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy to prevent miscarriage and other pregnancy complications appear to have a higher risk of spermatoceles.	general
Use of this drug was stopped in 1971 due to concerns about an increased risk of rare vaginal cancer in women.	general
Complications Male reproductive system Male reproductive system The male reproductive system makes, stores and moves sperm.	general
The testicles produce sperm.	general
Fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland combines with sperm to make semen.	general
The penis ejaculates semen during sexual intercourse.	general
A spermatocele is unlikely to cause complications.	general
However, if your spermatocele is painful or has grown so large that it's causing you discomfort, you might need to have surgery to remove the spermatocele.	general
Surgical removal might damage the epididymis or the vas deferens, a tube that transports sperm from the epididymis to the penis.	general
Damage to either can reduce fertility.	general
Another possible complication that can occur after surgery is that the spermatocele might come back, though this is uncommon.	general
Although there's no way to prevent a spermatocele, it's important for you to conduct scrotal self-exams at least monthly to detect changes, such as masses, in your scrotum.	general
Any new mass in your scrotum should be evaluated promptly.	general
Your doctor can instruct you in how to conduct a testicular self-examination, which can improve your chances of finding a mass.	general
How to examine your testicles A good time to examine your testicles is during or after a warm bath or shower.	general
The heat from the water relaxes your scrotum, making it easier for you to detect anything unusual.	general
Then follow these steps: Look for any swelling on the skin of the scrotum.	general
Stand in front of a mirror.	general
Place the index and middle fingers under the testicle while placing your thumbs on the top.	general
Examine each testicle with both hands.	general
Remember that the testicles are usually smooth, oval shaped and somewhat firm.	general
It's normal for one testicle to be slightly larger than the other.	general
Also, the cord leading upward from the top of the testicle (epididymis) is a normal part of the scrotum.	general
Gently roll the testicle between the thumbs and the fingers.	general
By regularly performing this exam, you'll become more familiar with your testicles and aware of any changes that might be of concern.	general
If you find a lump, call your doctor as soon as possible.	general
Regular self-examination is an important health habit.	general
But it can't substitute for a doctor's examination.	general
Your doctor normally checks your testicles whenever you have a physical exam.	general
Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis In cystic fibrosis, the airways fill with thick, sticky mucus, making it difficult to breathe.	general
The thick mucus is also an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi.	general
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body.	general
Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices.	general
These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery.	general
But in people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick.	general
Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas.	general
Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care, people with the condition are usually able to attend school and work, and often have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in previous decades.	general
Improvements in screening and treatments mean people with cystic fibrosis now may live into their mid- to late 30s, on average, and some are living into their 40s and 50s.	general
Products & Services Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States.	general
As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop.	general
For people born before newborn screening was performed, it's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.	general
Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease.	general
Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes.	general
Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood.	general
People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat.	general
Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children.	general
Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system.	general
However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia.	general
Respiratory signs and symptoms The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.	general
This can cause signs and symptoms such as: A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) Breathlessness Digestive signs and symptoms The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine.	general
Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat.	general
The result is often: Foul-smelling, greasy stools Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum ‚Äî the end of the large intestine ‚Äî to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse).	general
When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis.	general
Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis.	general
Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery.	general
Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis.	general
When to see a doctor If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis ‚Äî or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis ‚Äî talk with your doctor about testing for the disease.	general
Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing.	general
In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells.	general
The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat.	general
Many different defects can occur in the gene.	general
The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition.	general
Children need to inherit one copy of the gene from each parent in order to have the disease.	general
If children inherit only one copy, they won't develop cystic fibrosis.	general
However, they will be carriers and possibly pass the gene to their own children.	general
Risk factors Because cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder, it runs in families.	general
Family history.	general
Although cystic fibrosis occurs in all races, it is most common in white people of Northern European ancestry.	general
Complications Respiratory system complications Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways.	general
This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways (bronchial tubes).	general
Damaged airways (bronchiectasis).	general
Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi.	general
People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia.	general
Chronic infections.	general
Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps).	general
Growths in the nose (nasal polyps).	general
Over time, cystic fibrosis can cause thinning of the airway walls.	general
As a result, teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis may cough up blood.	general
Coughing up blood (hemoptysis).	general
This condition, in which air collects in the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, also is more common in older people with cystic fibrosis.	general
Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and breathlessness.	general
Pneumothorax.	general
Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works.	general
Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening.	general
Respiratory failure.	general
People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, for several days to weeks.	general
This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment in the hospital.	general
Acute exacerbations.	general
Digestive system complications Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines.	general
Without these enzymes, your body can't absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins.	general
Nutritional deficiencies.	general
The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar.	general
Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes.	general
Around 30 percent of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes by age 30.	general
The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed, leading to liver problems and sometimes gallstones.	general
Blocked bile duct.	general
Intestinal obstruction can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages.	general
Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are more likely than are infants to develop intussusception, a condition in which a section of the intestines folds in on itself like an accordion.	general
Intestinal obstruction.	general
is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine.	general
Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS).	general
Reproductive system complications Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely.	general
Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with cystic fibrosis to become biological fathers.	general
Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies.	general
Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor.	general
Other complications People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones.	general
Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis).	general
Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset.	general
Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure.	general
Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.	general
If you or your partner has close relatives with cystic fibrosis, you both may want to undergo genetic testing before having children.	general
The test, which is performed in a lab on a sample of blood, can help determine your risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis.	general
If you're already pregnant and the genetic test shows that your baby may be at risk of cystic fibrosis, your doctor can conduct additional tests on your developing child.	general
Genetic testing isn't for everyone.	general
Before you decide to be tested, you should talk to a genetic counselor about the psychological impact the test results might carry.	general
Epidermoid cyst Epidermoid cyst Epidermoid cysts occur most often on your face, neck and trunk.	general
Epidermoid (ep-ih-DUR-moid) cysts are noncancerous small bumps beneath the skin.	general
They can appear anywhere on the skin, but are most common on the face, neck and trunk.	general
Epidermoid cysts are slow growing and often painless, so they rarely cause problems or need treatment.	general
You might choose to have a cyst removed by a doctor if its appearance bothers you or if it's painful, ruptured or infected.	general
Many people refer to epidermoid cysts as sebaceous cysts, but they're different.	general
True sebaceous cysts are less common.	general
They arise from the glands that secrete oily matter that lubricates hair and skin (sebaceous glands).	general
Epidermoid cyst signs and symptoms include: A small, round bump under the skin, usually on the face, neck or trunk A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst A thick, yellow, smelly material that sometimes drains from the cyst Redness, swelling and tenderness in the area, if inflamed or infected When to see a doctor Most epidermoid cysts don't cause problems or need treatment.	general
See your doctor if you have one or more that: Grows rapidly Occurs in a spot that's constantly irritated Bothers you for cosmetic reasons Is in an unusual location, such as a finger and toe The surface of your skin (epidermis) is made up of a thin, protective layer of cells that your body continuously sheds.	general
Most epidermoid cysts form when these cells move deeper into your skin and multiply rather than slough off.	general
Sometimes the cysts form due to irritation or injury of the skin or the most superficial portion of a hair follicle.	general
The epidermal cells form the walls of the cyst and then secrete the protein keratin into the interior.	general
The keratin is the thick, yellow substance that sometimes drains from the cyst.	general
This abnormal growth of cells may be due to a damaged hair follicle or oil gland in your skin.	general
Many people refer to epidermoid cysts as sebaceous cysts, but they're different.	general
True sebaceous cysts are less common.	general
They arise from the glands that secrete oily matter that lubricates hair and skin (sebaceous glands).	general
Risk factors Nearly anyone can develop one or more epidermoid cysts, but these factors make you more susceptible: Being past puberty Injuring the skin Potential complications of epidermoid cysts include: An epidermoid cyst can become tender and swollen, even if it's not infected.	general
An inflamed cyst is difficult to remove.	general
Your doctor is likely to postpone removing it until the inflammation subsides.	general
Inflammation.	general
A ruptured cyst often leads to a boil-like infection that requires prompt treatment.	general
Cysts can become infected and painful (abscessed).	general
In very rare cases, epidermoid cysts can lead to skin cancer.	general
Skin cancer.	general
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that can infect almost anyone.	general
Once infected, your body retains the virus for life.	general
Most people don't know they have CMV because it rarely causes problems in healthy people.	general
But if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system, CMV is cause for concern.	general
A woman who develops an active CMV infection during pregnancy can pass the virus to her baby, who might then experience signs and symptoms.	general
For people with compromised immunity, especially due to organ transplantation, CMV infection can be fatal.	general
CMV spreads from person to person through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk.	general
There's no cure for the virus.	general
However, medications can help treat newborns and people with weak immune systems.	general
Most people infected with CMV who are otherwise healthy experience few if any signs and symptoms.	general
People at greater risk of signs and symptoms of CMV include: Newborns infected with CMV before birth (congenital CMV).	general
Infants who become infected during birth or shortly afterward (perinatal CMV).	general
This group includes babies infected through breast milk.	general
People with weakened immune systems, for example due to organ transplant or HIV infection.	general
Most babies with congenital CMV appear healthy at birth.	general
A few babies with congenital CMV who appear healthy at birth can develop signs over time ‚Äî sometimes not for months or years after birth.	general
The most common of these late-occurring signs are hearing loss and developmental delay.	general
A small number of babies may also develop vision problems.	general
Babies with congenital CMV who are sick at birth tend to have significant signs and symptoms, including: Premature birth Purple skin splotches or a rash or both Abnormally small head (microencephaly) People with weakened immunity If your immune system is weakened, you might experience more-serious signs and symptoms affecting your: Otherwise healthy adults Most people infected with CMV who are otherwise healthy experience few if any signs or symptoms.	general
When first infected, some adults may have symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis, including: Sore throat Muscle aches CMV mononucleosis is less likely than infectious mononucleosis to cause enlarged lymph nodes and spleen.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if: You have a weakened immune system and you're experiencing signs or symptoms of CMV infection.	general
CMV infection in people with compromised immunity can be serious or even fatal.	general
People who have undergone stem cell or organ transplants seem to be at greatest risk.	general
You develop a mononucleosis-like illness while you're pregnant so that you can be evaluated for CMV infection.	general
If you have CMV but are otherwise healthy, and you're experiencing any mild, generalized illness, you could be in a reactivation period.	general
Practical self-care, such as getting plenty of rest, should be enough for your body to control the infection.	general
When your child should see a doctor If you know you were infected with CMV during your pregnancy, tell your baby's doctor.	general
The doctor should regularly assess your baby for hearing or vision problems.	general
CMV is related to the viruses that cause chickenpox, herpes simplex and mononucleosis.	general
CMV may cycle through periods when it lies dormant and then reactivates.	general
If you're healthy, CMV mainly stays dormant.	general
During activation you can pass the virus to other people.	general
Casual contact doesn't transmit CMV.	general
The virus is spread through body fluids ‚Äî including blood, urine, saliva, breast milk, tears, semen and vaginal fluids.	general
Transmission might occur through: Touching your eyes or the inside of your nose or mouth after coming into contact with the body fluids of an infected person.	general
Sexual contact with an infected person.	general
The breast milk of an infected mother.	general
Organ transplantation or blood transfusions.	general
Birth.	general
An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby before or during birth.	general
The risk of virus transmission to your baby is higher if it's the first time you've had the infection rather than a reactivated infection.	general
Risk factors CMV is a widespread and common virus that can infect almost anyone.	general
Most healthy children and adults who contract the virus have few if any symptoms, so CMV often goes undiagnosed.	general
Complications Complications of CMV infection vary, depending on your overall health and when you were infected.	general
Otherwise healthy adults Rarely, CMV causes a healthy adult to develop mononucleosis.	general
Other rare complications for healthy adults include problems with the digestive system, liver, brain and nervous system.	general
People with weakened immunity Complications of CMV infection can include: Vision loss, due to inflammation of the light-sensing layer of the eye (retinitis) Digestive system problems, including inflammation of the colon (colitis), esophagus (esophagitis) and liver (hepatitis) Nervous system problems, including brain inflammation (encephalitis) Infants with congenital CMV Complications are more likely to develop if the infant's mother had a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, rather than a reactivated infection.	general
Complications for the baby can include: Hearing loss Intellectual disability Vision problems Careful hygiene is the best prevention against CMV.	general
You can take these precautions: Use soap and water for 15 to 20 seconds, especially if you have contact with young children or their diapers, drool or other oral secretions.	general
This is especially important if the children attend child care.	general
Wash your hands often.	general
Instead of kissing a child on the lips, for instance, kiss on the forehead.	general
This is especially important if you're pregnant.	general
Avoid contact with tears and saliva when you kiss a child.	general
Sharing glasses and kitchen utensils can spread the CMV virus.	general
Avoid sharing food or drinking out of the same glass as others.	general
When disposing of diapers, tissues and other items that have been contaminated with bodily fluids, be careful not to touch your hands to your face until after thoroughly washing your hands.	general
Be careful with disposable items.	general
Clean any surfaces that come in contact with children's urine or saliva.	general
Clean toys and countertops.	general
Wear a condom during sexual contact to prevent spreading the CMV virus through semen and vaginal fluids.	general
Practice safe sex.	general
If you have a compromised immune system, you may benefit from taking antiviral medication to prevent CMV disease.	general
Experimental vaccines are being tested for women of childbearing age.	general
These vaccines may be useful in preventing CMV infection in mothers and infants, and reducing the chance that babies born to women who are infected while pregnant will develop disabilities.	general
Dandruff is a common condition that causes the skin on the scalp to flake.	general
It isn't contagious or serious.	general
But it can be embarrassing and difficult to treat.	general
Mild dandruff can be treated with a gentle daily shampoo.	general
If that doesn't work, a medicated shampoo may help.	general
Symptoms may return later.	general
Dandruff is considered to be a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis.	general
In babies, seborrheic dermatitis is called cradle cap.	general
Dandruff signs and symptoms may include: Skin flakes on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache, and shoulders Itchy scalp Scaly, crusty scalp in infants with cradle cap The signs and symptoms may be more severe if you're stressed, and they tend to flare in cold, dry seasons.	general
When to see a doctor Most cases of dandruff don't require a doctor's care.	general
See your primary care doctor or a doctor who specializes in skin conditions (dermatologist) if your condition doesn‚Äôt improve with regular use of over-the-counter dandruff shampoo.	general
Irritated, oily skin Not shampooing enough A yeastlike fungus (malassezia) that feeds on oils on the scalps of most adults Other skin conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema Risk factors Almost anyone can have dandruff, but certain factors can make you more susceptible: Dandruff usually begins in young adulthood and continues through middle age.	general
That doesn't mean older adults don't get dandruff.	general
For some people, the problem can be lifelong.	general
Because more men have dandruff, some researchers think male hormones may play a role.	general
Being male.	general
Parkinson's disease and other diseases that affect the nervous system also seem to increase risk of dandruff.	general
So does having or a weakened immune system.	general
Certain illnesses.	general
Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep.	general
People with narcolepsy often find it difficult to stay awake for long periods of time, regardless of the circumstances.	general
Narcolepsy can cause serious disruptions in your daily routine.	general
Sometimes, narcolepsy can be accompanied by a sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), which can be triggered by strong emotion.	general
Narcolepsy that occurs with cataplexy is called type 1 narcolepsy.	general
Narcolepsy that occurs without cataplexy is known as type 2 narcolepsy.	general
Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there's no cure.	general
However, medications and lifestyle changes can help you manage the symptoms.	general
Support from others ‚Äî family, friends, employers, teachers ‚Äî can help you cope with narcolepsy.	general
The signs and symptoms of narcolepsy may worsen for the first few years and then continue for life.	general
They include: People with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning, anywhere, anytime.	general
For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly you nod off, sleeping for a few minutes up to a half-hour.	general
When you awaken, you feel refreshed, but eventually you get sleepy again.	general
Excessive daytime sleepiness.	general
You may also experience decreased alertness and focus throughout the day.	general
Excessive daytime sleepiness usually is the first symptom to appear and is often the most troublesome, making it difficult for you to concentrate and fully function.	general
This condition, called cataplexy (KAT-uh-plek-see), can cause a number of physical changes, from slurred speech to complete weakness of most muscles, and may last up to a few minutes.	general
Sudden loss of muscle tone.	general
Cataplexy is uncontrollable and is triggered by intense emotions, usually positive ones such as laughter or excitement, but sometimes fear, surprise or anger.	general
For example, when you laugh, your head may droop uncontrollably or your knees may suddenly buckle.	general
Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year, while others have numerous episodes daily.	general
Not everyone with narcolepsy experiences cataplexy.	general
People with narcolepsy often experience a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking.	general
These episodes are usually brief ‚Äî lasting a few seconds or minutes ‚Äî but can be frightening.	general
You may be aware of the condition and have no difficulty recalling it afterward, even if you had no control over what was happening to you.	general
Sleep paralysis.	general
This sleep paralysis mimics the type of temporary paralysis that normally occurs during a period of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.	general
This temporary immobility during REM sleep may prevent your body from acting out dream activity.	general
Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy, however.	general
Many people without narcolepsy experience some episodes of sleep paralysis.	general
REM sleep is typically when most dreaming happens.	general
REM sleep can occur at any time of the day in people with narcolepsy.	general
People with narcolepsy often transition quickly to REM sleep, usually within 15 minutes of falling asleep.	general
Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.	general
These hallucinations are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep and hypnopompic hallucinations if they occur upon waking.	general
An example is feeling as if there is a stranger in your bedroom.	general
These hallucinations may be particularly vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming and you experience your dreams as reality.	general
Hallucinations.	general
Other characteristics People with narcolepsy may have other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea ‚Äî a condition in which breathing starts and stops throughout the night ‚Äî restless legs syndrome and even insomnia.	general
Some people with narcolepsy experience automatic behavior during brief episodes of narcolepsy.	general
For example, you may fall asleep while performing a task you normally perform, such as writing, typing or driving, and you continue to perform that task while asleep.	general
When you awaken, you can't remember what you did, and you probably didn't do it well.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience excessive daytime sleepiness that disrupts your personal or professional life.	general
The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown.	general
People with type 1 narcolepsy have low levels of the chemical hypocretin (hi-poe-KREE-tin).	general
Hypocretin is an important neurochemical in your brain that helps regulate wakefulness and REM sleep.	general
Hypocretin levels are particularly low in those who experience cataplexy.	general
Exactly what causes the loss of hypocretin-producing cells in the brain isn't known, but experts suspect it's due to an autoimmune reaction.	general
It's also likely that genetics play a role in the development of narcolepsy.	general
But the risk of a parent passing this disorder to a child is very low ‚Äî only about 1 percent.	general
Research also indicates a possible association with exposure to the swine flu (H1N1 flu) virus and a certain form of H1N1 vaccine that's currently administered in Europe, though it's not yet clear why.	general
Normal sleep pattern vs.	general
narcolepsy The normal process of falling asleep begins with a phase called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.	general
During this phase, your brain waves slow considerably.	general
After an hour or so of NREM sleep, your brain activity changes, and REM sleep begins.	general
Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep.	general
In narcolepsy, however, you may suddenly enter into REM sleep without first experiencing NREM sleep, both at night and during the day.	general
Some of the characteristics of narcolepsy ‚Äî such as cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hallucinations ‚Äî are similar to changes that occur in REM sleep, but occur during wakefulness or drowsiness.	general
Risk factors There are only a few known risk factors for narcolepsy, including: Narcolepsy typically begins in people between 10 and 30 years old.	general
Your risk of narcolepsy is 20 to 40 times higher if you have a family member who has narcolepsy.	general
Family history.	general
Complications Narcolepsy may cause serious problems for you professionally and personally.	general
Others might see you as lazy or lethargic.	general
Your performance may suffer at school or work.	general
Public misunderstanding of the condition.	general
Intense feelings, such as anger or joy, can trigger signs of narcolepsy such as cataplexy, causing affected people to withdraw from emotional interactions.	general
Interference with intimate relationships.	general
Sleep attacks may result in physical harm to people with narcolepsy.	general
You're at increased risk of a car accident if you have an attack while driving.	general
Your risk of cuts and burns is greater if you fall asleep while preparing food.	general
Physical harm.	general
People with narcolepsy are more likely to be overweight.	general
The weight gain may be related to a low metabolism.	general
Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Each breast contains 15 to 20 lobes of glandular tissue, arranged like the petals of a daisy.	general
The lobes are further divided into smaller lobules that produce milk for breast-feeding.	general
Small tubes (ducts) conduct the milk to a reservoir that lies just beneath your nipple.	general
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells inside a milk duct in the breast.	general
DCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer.	general
DCIS is noninvasive, meaning it hasn't spread out of the milk duct and has a low risk of becoming invasive.	general
DCIS is usually found during a mammogram done as part of breast cancer screening or to investigate a breast lump.	general
While DCIS isn't an emergency, it does require an evaluation and a consideration of treatment options.	general
Treatment may include breast-conserving surgery combined with radiation or surgery to remove all of the breast tissue.	general
A clinical trial studying active monitoring as an alternative to surgery may be another option.	general
Products & Services DCIS doesn't typically have any signs or symptoms.	general
However, DCIS can sometimes cause signs such as: A breast lump Bloody nipple discharge DCIS is usually found on a mammogram and appears as small clusters of calcifications that have irregular shapes and sizes.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice a change in your breasts, such as a lump, an area of puckered or otherwise unusual skin, a thickened region under the skin, or nipple discharge.	general
Ask your doctor when you should consider breast cancer screening and how often it should be repeated.	general
Most groups recommend considering routine breast cancer screening beginning in your 40s.	general
Talk with your doctor about what's right for you.	general
It's not clear what causes DCIS.	general
DCIS forms when genetic mutations occur in the DNA of breast duct cells.	general
The genetic mutations cause the cells to appear abnormal, but the cells don't yet have the ability to break out of the breast duct.	general
Researchers don't know exactly what triggers the abnormal cell growth that leads to DCIS.	general
Factors that may play a part include your lifestyle, your environment and genes passed to you from your parents.	general
Risk factors Increasing age Personal history of benign breast disease, such as atypical hyperplasia Family history of breast cancer Never having been pregnant Beginning menopause after age 55 Genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer, such as those in the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 The Mayo Clinic experience and patient stories Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced.	general

De Quervain's tenosynovitis (dih-kwer-VAINS ten-oh-sine-oh-VIE-tis) is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of your wrist.	general
If you have de Quervain's tenosynovitis, it will probably hurt when you turn your wrist, grasp anything or make a fist.	general
Although the exact cause of de Quervain's tenosynovitis isn't known, any activity that relies on repetitive hand or wrist movement ‚Äî such as working in the garden, playing golf or racket sports, or lifting your baby ‚Äî can make it worse.	general
"Products & Services Pain near the base of your thumb Swelling near the base of your thumb Difficulty moving your thumb and wrist when you're doing something that involves grasping or pinching A ""sticking"" or ""stop-and-go"" sensation in your thumb when moving it If the condition goes too long without treatment, the pain may spread further into your thumb, back into your forearm or both."	general
Pinching, grasping and other movements of your thumb and wrist aggravate the pain.	general
When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if you're still having problems with pain or function and you've already tried: Not using your affected thumb Applying cold to the affected area Using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve) De Quervain‚Äôs tenosynovitis De Quervain‚Äôs tenosynovitis When you grip, grasp, clench, pinch or wring anything in your hand, two tendons in your wrist and lower thumb normally glide smoothly through the small tunnel that connects them to the base of the thumb.	general
Repeating a particular motion day after day may irritate the sheath around the two tendons, causing thickening and swelling that restricts their movement.	general
Chronic overuse of your wrist is commonly associated with de Quervain's tenosynovitis.	general
Tendons are rope-like structures that attach muscle to bone.	general
When you grip, grasp, clench, pinch or wring anything in your hand, two tendons in your wrist and lower thumb normally glide smoothly through the small tunnel that connects them to the base of the thumb.	general
Repeating a particular motion day after day may irritate the sheath around the two tendons, causing thickening and swelling that restricts their movement.	general
Other causes of de Quervain's tenosynovitis include: Direct injury to your wrist or tendon; scar tissue can restrict movement of the tendons Inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis Risk factors Risk factors for de Quervain's tenosynovitis include: If you're between the ages of 30 and 50, you have a higher risk of developing de Quervain's tenosynovitis than do other age groups, including children.	general
The condition is more common in women.	general
The condition may be associated with pregnancy.	general
Being pregnant.	general
Lifting your child repeatedly involves using your thumbs as leverage and may also be associated with the condition.	general
These may contribute to de Quervain's tenosynovitis.	general
Jobs or hobbies that involve repetitive hand and wrist motions.	general
Complications Untreated de Quervain's tenosynovitis might make it hard to use your hand and wrist properly and limit your wrist's range of motion.	general
Dry eyes is a common condition that occurs when your tears aren't able to provide adequate lubrication for your eyes.	general
Tears can be inadequate for many reasons.	general
For example, dry eyes may occur if you don't produce enough tears or if you produce poor-quality tears.	general
Dry eyes feel uncomfortable.	general
If you have dry eyes, your eyes may sting or burn.	general
You may experience dry eyes in certain situations, such as on an airplane, in an air-conditioned room, while riding a bike or after looking at a computer screen for a few hours.	general
Treatments for dry eyes may make you more comfortable.	general
These treatments can include lifestyle changes and eyedrops.	general
You'll likely need to take these measures indefinitely to control the symptoms of dry eyes.	general
Products & Services Signs and symptoms, which usually affect both eyes, may include: A stinging, burning or scratchy sensation in your eyes Stringy mucus in or around your eyes Sensitivity to light Difficulty wearing contact lenses Difficulty with nighttime driving Watery eyes, which is the body's response to the irritation of dry eyes Blurred vision or eye fatigue When to see a doctor See your doctor if you've had prolonged signs and symptoms of dry eyes, including red, irritated, tired or painful eyes.	general
Your doctor can take steps to determine what's bothering your eyes or refer you to a specialist.	general
Tear glands and tear ducts Tear glands and tear ducts The tear glands (lacrimal glands), located above each eyeball, continuously supply tear fluid that's wiped across the surface of your eye each time you blink your eyes.	general
Excess fluid drains through the tear ducts into the nose.	general
Dry eyes are caused by a lack of adequate tears.	general
Your tears are a complex mixture of water, fatty oils and mucus.	general
This mixture helps make the surface of your eyes smooth and clear, and it helps protect your eyes from infection.	general
For some people, the cause of dry eyes is decreased tear production.	general
For others it's increased tear evaporation and an imbalance in the makeup of your tears.	general
Decreased tear production Dry eyes can occur when you're unable to produce enough tears.	general
The medical term for this condition is keratoconjunctivitis sicca (ker-uh-toe-kun-junk-tih-VY-tis SIK-uh).	general
Common causes of decreased tear production include: Certain medical conditions, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, thyroid disorders and vitamin A deficiency Certain medications, including antihistamines, decongestants, hormone replacement therapy, antidepressants, and drugs for high blood pressure, acne, birth control and Parkinson's disease Laser eye surgery, though symptoms of dry eyes related to this procedure are usually temporary Tear gland damage from inflammation or radiation Increased tear evaporation Wind, smoke or dry air Blinking less often, which tends to occur when you're concentrating, for example, while reading, driving or working at a computer Eyelid problems, such as out-turning of the lids (ectropion) and in-turning of the lids (entropion) Imbalance in tear composition The tear film has three basic layers: oil, water and mucus.	general
Problems with any of these layers can cause dry eyes.	general
For example, the oil film produced by small glands on the edge of your eyelids (meibomian glands) might become clogged.	general
Blocked meibomian glands are more common in people with inflammation along the edge of their eyelids (blepharitis), rosacea or other skin disorders.	general
Risk factors Factors that make it more likely that you'll experience dry eyes include: Being older than 50.	general
Tear production tends to diminish as you get older.	general
Dry eyes are more common in people over 50.	general
Being a woman.	general
A lack of tears is more common in women, especially if they experience hormonal changes due to pregnancy, using birth control pills or menopause.	general
Eating a diet that is low in vitamin A, which is found in liver, carrots and broccoli, or low in omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, walnuts and vegetable oils Wearing contact lenses People who have dry eyes may experience these complications: Your tears protect the surface of your eyes from infection.	general
Without adequate tears, you may have an increased risk of eye infection.	general
Eye infections.	general
If left untreated, severe dry eyes may lead to eye inflammation, abrasion of the corneal surface, corneal ulcer and vision problems.	general
Damage to the surface of your eyes.	general
Dry eyes can make it difficult to perform everyday activities, such as reading.	general
Decreased quality of life.	general
If you experience dry eyes, pay attention to the situations that are most likely to cause your symptoms.	general
Then find ways to avoid those situations in order to prevent your dry eyes symptoms.	general
For instance: Don't direct hair dryers, car heaters, air conditioners or fans toward your eyes.	general
Avoid air blowing in your eyes.	general
In winter, a humidifier can add moisture to dry indoor air.	general
Add moisture to the air.	general
Safety shields can be added to the tops and sides of eyeglasses to block wind and dry air.	general
Ask about shields where you buy your eyeglasses.	general
Consider wearing wraparound sunglasses or other protective eyewear.	general
If you're reading or doing another task that requires visual concentration, take periodic eye breaks.	general
Close your eyes for a few minutes.	general
Or blink repeatedly for a few seconds to help spread your tears evenly over your eyes.	general
Take eye breaks during long tasks.	general
The air at high altitudes, in desert areas and in airplanes can be extremely dry.	general
When spending time in such an environment, it may be helpful to frequently close your eyes for a few minutes at a time to minimize evaporation of your tears.	general
Be aware of your environment.	general
If your computer screen is above eye level, you'll open your eyes wider to view the screen.	general
Position your computer screen below eye level so that you won't open your eyes as wide.	general
This may help slow the evaporation of your tears between eye blinks.	general
Position your computer screen below eye level.	general
If you smoke, ask your doctor for help devising a quit-smoking strategy that's most likely to work for you.	general
If you don't smoke, stay away from people who do.	general
Smoke can worsen dry eyes symptoms.	general
Stop smoking and avoid smoke.	general
If you have chronic dry eyes, use eyedrops even when your eyes feel fine to keep them well-lubricated.	general
Use artificial tears regularly.	general
Blood clot in leg vein Blood clot in leg vein A blood clot in a leg vein may cause pain, warmth and tenderness in the affected area.	general
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually in your legs.	general
Deep vein thrombosis can cause leg pain or swelling, but also can occur with no symptoms.	general
Deep vein thrombosis can develop if you have certain medical conditions that affect how your blood clots.	general
It can also happen if you don't move for a long time, such as after surgery or an accident, or when you're confined to bed.	general
Deep vein thrombosis can be very serious because blood clots in your veins can break loose, travel through your bloodstream and lodge in your lungs, blocking blood flow (pulmonary embolism).	general
Products & Services Deep vein thrombosis signs and symptoms can include: Swelling in the affected leg.	general
Rarely, there's swelling in both legs.	general
Pain in your leg.	general
The pain often starts in your calf and can feel like cramping or soreness.	general
Red or discolored skin on the leg.	general
A feeling of warmth in the affected leg.	general
Deep vein thrombosis can occur without noticeable symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor If you develop signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, contact your doctor.	general
If you develop signs or symptoms of a pulmonary embolism ‚Äî a life-threatening complication of deep vein thrombosis ‚Äî seek immediate medical attention.	general
The warning signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include: Sudden shortness of breath Chest pain or discomfort that worsens when you take a deep breath or when you cough Feeling lightheaded or dizzy, or fainting Rapid pulse The blood clots of deep vein thrombosis can be caused by anything that prevents your blood from circulating or clotting normally, such as injury to a vein, surgery, certain medications and limited movement.	general
Risk factors Many factors can increase your risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).	general
The more you have, the greater your risk of DVT.	general
Risk factors include: Some people inherit a disorder that makes their blood clot more easily.	general
This condition on its own might not cause blood clots unless combined with one or more other risk factors.	general
Inheriting a blood-clotting disorder.	general
When your legs remain still for long periods, your calf muscles don't contract to help blood circulate, which can increase the risk of blood clots.	general
Prolonged bed rest, such as during a long hospital stay, or paralysis.	general
Injury to your veins or surgery can increase the risk of blood clots.	general
Injury or surgery.	general
Pregnancy increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs.	general
Women with an inherited clotting disorder are especially at risk.	general
The risk of blood clots from pregnancy can continue for up to six weeks after you have your baby.	general
Both can increase your blood's ability to clot.	general
Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) or hormone replacement therapy.	general
Being overweight increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs.	general
Being overweight or obese.	general
Smoking affects blood clotting and circulation, which can increase your risk of DVT.	general
Some forms of cancer increase substances in your blood that cause your blood to clot.	general
Some forms of cancer treatment also increase the risk of blood clots.	general
This increases your risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism.	general
Because people with heart failure have limited heart and lung function, the symptoms caused by even a small pulmonary embolism are more noticeable.	general
Heart failure.	general
Bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, increase the risk of DVT.	general
Inflammatory bowel disease.	general
If you or someone in your family has had one or both of these, you might be at greater risk of developing a DVT.	general
A personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.	general
Being older than 60 increases your risk of DVT, though it can occur at any age.	general
When your legs remain still for hours, your calf muscles don't contract, which normally helps blood circulate.	general
Blood clots can form in the calves of your legs if your calf muscles don't move for long periods.	general
Sitting for long periods of time, such as when driving or flying.	general
Complications Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot gets lodged in an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow to part of the lung.	general
Blood clots most often originate in the legs and travel up through the right side of the heart and into the lungs.	general
A serious complication associated with deep vein thrombosis is pulmonary embolism.	general
Pulmonary embolism A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood vessel in your lung becomes blocked by a blood clot (thrombus) that travels to your lung from another part of your body, usually your leg.	general
A pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening.	general
It's important to watch for signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism and seek medical attention if they occur.	general
Signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include: Sudden shortness of breath Chest pain or discomfort that worsens when you take a deep breath or when you cough Feeling lightheaded or dizzy, or fainting Rapid pulse Postphlebitic syndrome A common complication that can occur after deep vein thrombosis is known as postphlebitic syndrome, also called postthrombotic syndrome.	general
Damage to your veins from the blood clot reduces blood flow in the affected areas, which can cause: Persistent swelling of your legs (edema) Skin discoloration Measures to prevent deep vein thrombosis include: If you have had surgery or have been on bed rest for other reasons, try to get moving as soon as possible.	general
If you're sitting for a while, don't cross your legs, which can hamper blood flow.	general
If you're traveling a long distance by car, stop every hour or so and walk around.	general
Avoid sitting still.	general
If you're on a plane, stand or walk occasionally.	general
If you can't do that, exercise your lower legs.	general
Try raising and lowering your heels while keeping your toes on the floor, then raising your toes with your heels are on the floor.	general
Lose weight and quit smoking.	general
Make lifestyle changes.	general
Regular exercise lowers your risk of blood clots, which is especially important for people who sit a lot or travel frequently.	general

Tularemia is a rare infectious disease that typically attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs.	general
Tularemia ‚Äî also called rabbit fever or deer fly fever ‚Äî is caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis.	general
The disease mainly affects mammals, especially rodents, rabbits and hares, although it can also infect birds, sheep, and domestic animals, such as dogs, cats and hamsters.	general
Tularemia spreads to humans through several routes, including insect bites and direct exposure to an infected animal.	general
Highly contagious and potentially fatal, tularemia usually can be treated effectively with specific antibiotics if diagnosed early.	general
Most people exposed to tularemia who become sick generally do so within three to five days, although it can take as long as 14 days.	general
Several types of tularemia exist, and which type you get depends on how and where the bacteria enter the body.	general
Each type of tularemia has its own set of symptoms.	general
Ulceroglandular tularemia This is the most common form of the disease.	general
Signs and symptoms include: A skin ulcer that forms at the site of infection ‚Äî usually an insect or animal bite Swollen and painful lymph glands Glandular tularemia People with glandular tularemia have the same signs and symptoms of ulceroglandular tularemia, but without skin ulcers.	general
Oculoglandular tularemia Eye redness Sensitivity to light Oropharyngeal tularemia Usually caused by eating poorly cooked wild animal meat or drinking contaminated water, this form affects the mouth, throat and digestive tract.	general
Signs and symptoms include: Pneumonic tularemia This type of tularemia causes signs and symptoms typical of pneumonia: Difficulty breathing Other forms of tularemia also can spread to the lungs.	general
Typhoidal tularemia This rare and serious form of the disease usually causes: Extreme exhaustion When to see a doctor If you think you may have been exposed to tularemia ‚Äî especially if you've been bitten by a tick or handled a wild animal in an area where tularemia is found and have developed fever, skin ulcers or swollen glands ‚Äî see a doctor as soon as possible.	general
Tularemia doesn't occur naturally in humans and isn't known to pass from person to person.	general
However, tularemia occurs worldwide, especially in rural areas, because many mammals, birds and insects are infected with F. tularensis.	general
The organism can live for weeks in soil, water and dead animals.	general
Unlike some infectious diseases that spread from animals to people through a single route, tularemia has several modes of transmission.	general
How you get the disease usually determines the type and severity of symptoms.	general
In general, you can get tularemia through: Although a number of insects carry tularemia, ticks and deer flies are most likely to transmit the disease to humans.	general
Tick bites cause a large percentage of cases of ulceroglandular tularemia.	general
Insect bites.	general
Ulceroglandular tularemia can also result from handling or being bitten by an infected animal, most often a rabbit or hare.	general
Bacteria enter the skin through small cuts and abrasions or a bite, and an ulcer forms at the wound site.	general
The ocular form of tularemia can occur when you rub your eyes after touching an infected animal.	general
Exposure to sick or dead animals Bacteria in the soil can become airborne during gardening, construction or other activities that disturb the earth.	general
Inhaling the bacteria can lead to pneumonic tularemia.	general
Laboratory workers who work with tularemia also are at risk of airborne infection.	general
Airborne bacteria.	general
Although uncommon, it's possible to get tularemia from eating undercooked meat of an infected animal or drinking contaminated water.	general
The signs include vomiting, diarrhea and other digestive problems (oropharyngeal tularemia).	general
Contaminated food or water.	general
Heat kills F. tularensis, so cook meat to the right temperature ‚Äî a minimum of 165 F (73.	general
8 C) for ground meat and game meat ‚Äî to make it safe to eat.	general
Risk factors Although anyone of any age can develop tularemia, engaging in certain occupations or activities or living in certain areas pose a greater risk.	general
Living in or visiting certain areas Tularemia has been reported in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and Europe.	general
In the United States, it's most common in the south-central states, the Pacific Northwest and parts of Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard.	general
Having certain hobbies or occupations The following can increase your risk of developing tularemia: Because hunters are exposed to wild animal blood and may eat their flesh, they're at risk of tularemia.	general
Hunting and trapping.	general
Gardeners and landscapers may also be at risk of tularemia.	general
It's possible that gardeners inhale bacteria that are stirred up while working the soil or when using mowers and weed trimmers.	general
Gardening or landscaping.	general
People who work with wildlife are at increased risk of tularemia.	general
Working in wildlife management or veterinary medicine.	general
Complications Left untreated, tularemia can be fatal.	general
Other possible complications include: Pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure ‚Äî a condition in which the lungs don't take in enough oxygen, don't release enough carbon dioxide or both.	general
Inflammation of the lungs (pneumonia).	general
Meningitis is a serious and sometimes life-threatening infection of the fluid and membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord.	general
Infection around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).	general
This is swelling and irritation of the pericardium, the thin membrane that surrounds the heart.	general
Mild pericarditis may improve without treatment, but more-serious cases may require antibiotic therapy.	general
Irritation around the heart (pericarditis).	general
Tularemia bacteria sometimes spread to the bones.	general
Bone infection (osteomyelitis).	general
There's currently no publicly available vaccine for tularemia.	general
If you work in a high-risk occupation or live in an area where tularemia is present, these measures may help reduce your chance of infection: Most people in the United States get tularemia through tick bites.	general
In other parts of the world, tularemia is most commonly contracted through mosquito bites.	general
If you spend time in tick or mosquito-infested areas, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, tuck your pants into your socks, and use a broad-brimmed hat to help protect your face and neck.	general
Even bundled up, you'll need to check your skin and clothing often for ticks.	general
Protect yourself from insects.	general
Use an insect repellent with 20 to 30 percent DEET, picaridin or IR3535, but follow the manufacturer's directions carefully.	general
Apply insect repellant in moderation, and wash it off at the end of the day.	general
Check yourself for ticks often and remove them immediately if you find any.	general
Home gardeners and professional landscapers should consider wearing a face mask when excavating the soil, clearing weeds or brush, or mowing lawns.	general
Take care when gardening.	general
If you hunt or handle wild rabbits or hares, wear gloves and protective goggles, and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after touching the animal.	general
Cook all wild meat thoroughly, and avoid skinning or dressing any animal that appeared ill.	general
Handle animals carefully.	general
Livestock and pets can contract tularemia if they eat part of a diseased rabbit or are bitten by an infected tick.	general
To help keep your pets safe, avoid letting them outside unsupervised, provide them with flea and tick protection, and don't let them come in close contact with wild or dead animals.	general
Protect your pets.	general
Dehydration occurs when you use or lose more fluid than you take in, and your body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions.	general
If you don't replace lost fluids, you will get dehydrated.	general
Anyone may become dehydrated, but the condition is especially dangerous for young children and older adults.	general
The most common cause of dehydration in young children is severe diarrhea and vomiting.	general
Older adults naturally have a lower volume of water in their bodies, and may have conditions or take medications that increase the risk of dehydration.	general
This means that even minor illnesses, such as infections affecting the lungs or bladder, can result in dehydration in older adults.	general
Dehydration also can occur in any age group if you don't drink enough water during hot weather ‚Äî especially if you are exercising vigorously.	general
You can usually reverse mild to moderate dehydration by drinking more fluids, but severe dehydration needs immediate medical treatment.	general
Thirst isn't always a reliable early indicator of the body's need for water.	general
Many people, particularly older adults, don't feel thirsty until they're already dehydrated.	general
That's why it's important to increase water intake during hot weather or when you're ill.	general
The signs and symptoms of dehydration also may differ by age.	general
Infant or young child Dry mouth and tongue No tears when crying Sunken eyes, cheeks Listlessness or irritability Call your family doctor if you or a loved one: Has had diarrhea for 24 hours or more Is irritable or disoriented and much sleepier or less active than usual Can't keep down fluids Sometimes dehydration occurs for simple reasons: You don't drink enough because you're sick or busy, or because you lack access to safe drinking water when you're traveling, hiking or camping.	general
Other dehydration causes include: Severe, acute diarrhea ‚Äî that is, diarrhea that comes on suddenly and violently ‚Äî can cause a tremendous loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time.	general
If you have vomiting along with diarrhea, you lose even more fluids and minerals.	general
Diarrhea, vomiting.	general
In general, the higher your fever, the more dehydrated you may become.	general
The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting.	general
You lose water when you sweat.	general
If you do vigorous activity and don't replace fluids as you go along, you can become dehydrated.	general
Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose.	general
Excessive sweating.	general
This may be due to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes.	general
Certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications, also can lead to dehydration, generally because they cause you to urinate more.	general
Increased urination.	general
Risk factors Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain people are at greater risk: The most likely group to experience severe diarrhea and vomiting, infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration.	general
Having a higher surface area to volume area, they also lose a higher proportion of their fluids from a high fever or burns.	general
Young children often can't tell you that they're thirsty, nor can they get a drink for themselves.	general
Infants and children.	general
As you age, your body's fluid reserve becomes smaller, your ability to conserve water is reduced and your thirst sense becomes less acute.	general
These problems are compounded by chronic illnesses such as diabetes and dementia, and by the use of certain medications.	general
Older adults also may have mobility problems that limit their ability to obtain water for themselves.	general
Older adults.	general
Having uncontrolled or untreated diabetes puts you at high risk of dehydration.	general
Kidney disease also increases your risk, as do medications that increase urination.	general
Even having a cold or sore throat makes you more susceptible to dehydration because you're less likely to feel like eating or drinking when you're sick.	general
People with chronic illnesses.	general
When it's hot and humid, your risk of dehydration and heat illness increases.	general
That's because when the air is humid, sweat can't evaporate and cool you as quickly as it normally does, and this can lead to an increased body temperature and the need for more fluids.	general
People who work or exercise outside.	general
Complications Dehydration can lead to serious complications, including: If you don't drink enough fluids when you're exercising vigorously and perspiring heavily, you may end up with a heat injury, ranging in severity from mild heat cramps to heat exhaustion or potentially life-threatening heatstroke.	general
Heat injury.	general
Prolonged or repeated bouts of dehydration can cause urinary tract infections, kidney stones and even kidney failure.	general
Urinary and kidney problems.	general
Electrolytes ‚Äî such as potassium and sodium ‚Äî help carry electrical signals from cell to cell.	general
If your electrolytes are out of balance, the normal electrical messages can become mixed up, which can lead to involuntary muscle contractions and sometimes to a loss of consciousness.	general
This is one of the most serious, and sometimes life-threatening, complications of dehydration.	general
It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body.	general
Low blood volume shock (hypovolemic shock).	general
To prevent dehydration, drink plenty of fluids and eat foods high in water such as fruits and vegetables.	general
Letting thirst be your guide is an adequate daily guideline for most healthy people.	general
People may need to take in more fluids if they are experiencing conditions such as: If your child is vomiting or has diarrhea, start giving extra water or an oral rehydration solution at the first signs of illness.	general
Don't wait until dehydration occurs.	general
Vomiting or diarrhea.	general
In general, it's best to start hydrating the day before strenuous exercise.	general
Producing lots of clear, dilute urine is a good indication that you're well-hydrated.	general
During the activity, replenish fluids at regular intervals and continue drinking water or other fluids after you're finished.	general
Strenuous exercise.	general
You need to drink additional water in hot or humid weather to help lower your body temperature and to replace what you lose through sweating.	general
You may also need extra water in cold weather to combat moisture loss from dry air, particularly at higher altitudes Hot or cold weather.	general
Older adults most commonly become dehydrated during minor illnesses ‚Äî such as influenza, bronchitis or bladder infections.	general
Make sure to drink extra fluids when you're not feeling well.	general
Delayed ejaculation ‚Äî sometimes called impaired ejaculation ‚Äî is a condition in which it takes an extended period of sexual stimulation for men to reach sexual climax and release semen from the penis (ejaculate).	general
Some men with delayed ejaculation are unable to ejaculate at all.	general
Delayed ejaculation can be temporary or a lifelong problem.	general
Possible causes of delayed ejaculation include certain chronic health conditions, surgeries and medications.	general
Treatment for delayed ejaculation depends on the underlying cause.	general
It's normal for men to have delayed ejaculation from time to time.	general
Delayed ejaculation is only a problem if it's ongoing or causes stress for you or your partner.	general
Some men with delayed ejaculation need 30 minutes or more of sexual stimulation to have an orgasm and ejaculate.	general
Other men might not be able to ejaculate at all (anejaculation).	general
But, there's no specific time that indicates a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation.	general
Instead, you are probably experiencing delayed ejaculation if the delay is causing distress or frustration, or if you have to stop sexual activity due to fatigue, physical irritation, loss of erection or a request from your partner.	general
Often, men might have difficulty reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner.	general
Some men can ejaculate only when masturbating.	general
Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms: With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity.	general
Acquired delayed ejaculation occurs after a period of normal sexual functioning.	general
Lifelong vs.	general
acquired.	general
Generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of stimulation.	general
Situational delayed ejaculation occurs only under certain circumstances.	general
Generalized vs.	general
situational.	general
These categories help in diagnosing an underlying cause and determining what might be the most effective treatment.	general
When to see a doctor Your primary care doctor is a good place to start when you have delayed ejaculation.	general
See your doctor if: Delayed ejaculation is an issue for you or your partner You have another known health problem that might be linked to delayed ejaculation, or you take medications that could be causing the problem You have other symptoms along with delayed ejaculation that might or might not seem related Delayed ejaculation can result from medications, certain chronic health conditions and surgeries.	general
Or it might be caused by substance misuse or a mental health concern, such as depression, anxiety or stress.	general
In many cases, it is due to a combination of physical and psychological concerns.	general
Psychological causes of delayed ejaculation include: Depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions Relationship problems due to stress, poor communication or other concerns Anxiety about performance Poor body image Cultural or religious taboos Differences between the reality of sex with a partner and sexual fantasies Medications and other substances that can cause delayed ejaculation include: Some antidepressants Certain diuretics Alcohol ‚Äî particularly drinking too much (excessive alcohol use or alcoholism) Physical causes of delayed ejaculation include: Certain birth defects affecting the male reproductive system Injury to the pelvic nerves that control orgasm Certain infections, such as a urinary tract infection Prostate surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate or prostate removal Neurological diseases, such as diabetic neuropathy, stroke or nerve damage to the spinal cord Hormone-related conditions, such as low thyroid hormone level (hypothyroidism) or low testosterone level (hypogonadism) Retrograde ejaculation, a condition in which the semen goes backward into the bladder rather than out of the penis For some men, a minor physical problem that causes a delay in ejaculation might cause anxiety about ejaculating during a sexual encounter.	general
The resulting anxiety might worsen delayed ejaculation.	general
Stomach and pyloric valve Stomach and pyloric valve Your stomach is a muscular sac about the size of a small melon that expands when you eat or drink to hold as much as a gallon of food or liquid.	general
Once your stomach pulverizes the food, strong muscular contractions (peristaltic waves) push the food toward the pyloric valve, which leads to the upper portion of your small intestine (duodenum).	general
Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal spontaneous movement of the muscles (motility) in your stomach.	general
Ordinarily, strong muscular contractions propel food through your digestive tract.	general
But if you have gastroparesis, your stomach's motility is slowed down or doesn't work at all, preventing your stomach from emptying properly.	general
Certain medications, such as opioid pain relievers, some antidepressants, and high blood pressure and allergy medications, can lead to slow gastric emptying and cause similar symptoms.	general
For people who already have gastroparesis, these medications may make their condition worse.	general
Gastroparesis can interfere with normal digestion, cause nausea and vomiting, and cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition.	general
The cause of gastroparesis is usually unknown.	general
Sometimes it's a complication of diabetes, and some people develop gastroparesis after surgery.	general
Although there's no cure for gastroparesis, changes to your diet, along with medication, can offer some relief.	general
A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites Vomiting undigested food eaten a few hours earlier Acid reflux Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Lack of appetite Weight loss and malnutrition Many people with gastroparesis don't have any noticeable signs and symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
It's not always clear what leads to gastroparesis.	general
But in many cases, gastroparesis is believed to be caused by damage to a nerve that controls the stomach muscles (vagus nerve).	general
The vagus nerve helps manage the complex processes in your digestive tract, including signaling the muscles in your stomach to contract and push food into the small intestine.	general
A damaged vagus nerve can't send signals normally to your stomach muscles.	general
This may cause food to remain in your stomach longer, rather than move normally into your small intestine to be digested.	general
The vagus nerve can be damaged by diseases, such as diabetes, or by surgery to the stomach or small intestine.	general
Risk factors Abdominal or esophageal surgery Infection, usually a virus Certain medications that slow the rate of stomach emptying, such as narcotic pain medications Scleroderma (a connective tissue disease) Nervous system diseases, such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis Hypothyroidism (low thyroid) Women are more likely to develop gastroparesis than are men.	general
Complications Gastroparesis can cause several complications, such as: Ongoing vomiting can cause dehydration.	general
Severe dehydration.	general
Poor appetite can mean you don't take in enough calories, or you may be unable to absorb enough nutrients due to vomiting.	general
Malnutrition.	general
Undigested food in your stomach can harden into a solid mass called a bezoar.	general
Bezoars can cause nausea and vomiting and may be life-threatening if they prevent food from passing into your small intestine.	general
Undigested food that hardens and remains in your stomach.	general
Although gastroparesis doesn't cause diabetes, frequent changes in the rate and amount of food passing into the small bowel can cause erratic changes in blood sugar levels.	general
These variations in blood sugar make diabetes worse.	general
In turn, poor control of blood sugar levels makes gastroparesis worse.	general
Unpredictable blood sugar changes.	general
An acute flare-up of symptoms can make it difficult to work and keep up with other responsibilities.	general
Decreased quality of life.	general
Delayed sleep phase ‚Äî officially known as delayed sleep-wake phase sleep disorder ‚Äî is an internal sleep clock (circadian rhythm) sleep disorder in which your sleep pattern is delayed two hours or more from a conventional sleep pattern, causing you to go to sleep later and wake up later.	general
Delirium is a serious disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of the environment.	general
The start of delirium is usually rapid ‚Äî within hours or a few days.	general
Delirium can often be traced to one or more contributing factors, such as a severe or chronic illness, changes in metabolic balance (such as low sodium), medication, infection, surgery, or alcohol or drug intoxication or withdrawal.	general
Because symptoms of delirium and dementia can be similar, input from a family member or caregiver may be important for a doctor to make an accurate diagnosis.	general
Signs and symptoms of delirium usually begin over a few hours or a few days.	general
They often fluctuate throughout the day, and there may be periods of no symptoms.	general
Symptoms tend to be worse during the night when it's dark and things look less familiar.	general
Primary signs and symptoms include those below.	general
Reduced awareness of the environment This may result in: An inability to stay focused on a topic or to switch topics Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions or conversation Being easily distracted by unimportant things Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to the environment Poor thinking skills (cognitive impairment) This may appear as: Poor memory, particularly of recent events Disorientation ‚Äî for example, not knowing where you are or who you are Difficulty speaking or recalling words Rambling or nonsense speech Restlessness, agitation or combative behavior Calling out, moaning or making other sounds Being quiet and withdrawn ‚Äî especially in older adults Slowed movement or lethargy Emotional disturbances Personality changes Probably the most easily recognized type, this may include restlessness (for example, pacing), agitation, rapid mood changes or hallucinations, and refusal to cooperate with care.	general
Hyperactive delirium.	general
This may include inactivity or reduced motor activity, sluggishness, abnormal drowsiness, or seeming to be in a daze.	general
Hypoactive delirium.	general
This includes both hyperactive and hypoactive signs and symptoms.	general
The person may quickly switch back and forth from hyperactive to hypoactive states.	general
Mixed delirium.	general
Delirium and dementia Dementia and delirium may be particularly difficult to distinguish, and a person may have both.	general
In fact, delirium frequently occurs in people with dementia.	general
But having episodes of delirium does not always mean a person has dementia.	general
So a dementia assessment should not be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading.	general
Dementia is the progressive decline of memory and other thinking skills due to the gradual dysfunction and loss of brain cells.	general
The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease.	general
Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include: The onset of delirium occurs within a short time, while dementia usually begins with relatively minor symptoms that gradually worsen over time.	general
The ability to stay focused or maintain attention is significantly impaired with delirium.	general
A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert.	general
The appearance of delirium symptoms can fluctuate significantly and frequently throughout the day.	general
While people with dementia have better and worse times of day, their memory and thinking skills stay at a fairly constant level during the course of a day.	general
Fluctuation.	general
When to see a doctor If a relative, friend or someone in your care shows any signs or symptoms of delirium, see a doctor.	general
Your input about the person's symptoms, typical thinking and everyday abilities will be important for a proper diagnosis and for finding the underlying cause.	general
If you notice signs and symptoms of delirium in a person in a hospital or nursing home, report your concerns to the nursing staff or doctor rather than assuming that those problems have been observed.	general
Older people recovering in the hospital or living in a long-term care facility are particularly at risk of delirium.	general
Delirium occurs when the normal sending and receiving of signals in the brain become impaired.	general
This impairment is most likely caused by a combination of factors that make the brain vulnerable and trigger a malfunction in brain activity.	general
Delirium may have a single cause or more than one cause, such as a combination of a medical condition and drug toxicity.	general
Sometimes no cause can be identified.	general
Possible causes include: Certain medications or drug toxicity Alcohol or drug intoxication or withdrawal A medical condition, such as a stroke, heart attack, worsening lung or liver disease, or an injury from a fall Metabolic imbalances, such as low sodium or low calcium Severe, chronic or terminal illness Fever and acute infection, particularly in children Urinary tract infection, pneumonia or the flu, especially in older adults Exposure to a toxin, such as carbon monoxide, cyanide or other poisons Malnutrition or dehydration Several medications or combinations of drugs can trigger delirium, including some types of: Sleep medications Allergy medications (antihistamines) Risk factors Any condition that results in a hospital stay, especially in intensive care or after surgery, increases the risk of delirium, as does being a resident in a nursing home.	general
Delirium is more common in older adults.	general
Examples of other conditions that increase the risk of delirium include: Brain disorders such as dementia, stroke or Parkinson's disease Previous delirium episodes Complications Delirium may last only a few hours or as long as several weeks or months.	general
If issues contributing to delirium are addressed, the recovery time is often shorter.	general
The degree of recovery depends to some extent on the health and mental status before the onset of delirium.	general
People with dementia, for example, may experience a significant overall decline in memory and thinking skills.	general
People in better health are more likely to fully recover.	general
People with other serious, chronic or terminal illnesses may not regain the levels of thinking skills or functioning that they had before the onset of delirium.	general
Delirium in seriously ill people is also more likely to lead to: General decline in health Poor recovery from surgery Need for institutional care Increased risk of death The most successful approach to preventing delirium is to target risk factors that might trigger an episode.	general
Hospital environments present a special challenge ‚Äî frequent room changes, invasive procedures, loud noises, poor lighting, and lack of natural light and sleep can worsen confusion.	general
Evidence indicates that certain strategies ‚Äî promoting good sleep habits, helping the person remain calm and well-oriented, and helping prevent medical problems or other complications ‚Äî can help prevent or reduce the severity of delirium.	general
Dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with your daily life.	general
It isn't a specific disease, but several different diseases may cause dementia.	general
Though dementia generally involves memory loss, memory loss has different causes.	general
Having memory loss alone doesn't mean you have dementia.	general
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of a progressive dementia in older adults, but there are a number of causes of dementia.	general
Depending on the cause, some dementia symptoms may be reversible.	general
Products & Services Dementia symptoms vary depending on the cause, but common signs and symptoms include: Cognitive changes Memory loss, which is usually noticed by a spouse or someone else Difficulty communicating or finding words Difficulty with visual and spatial abilities, such as getting lost while driving Difficulty reasoning or problem-solving Difficulty handling complex tasks Difficulty with coordination and motor functions Confusion and disorientation When to see a doctor See a doctor if you or a loved one has memory problems or other dementia symptoms.	general
Some treatable medical conditions can cause dementia symptoms, so it's important to determine the underlying cause.	general
Dementia is caused by damage to or loss of nerve cells and their connections in the brain.	general
Depending on the area of the brain that's affected by the damage, dementia can affect people differently and cause different symptoms.	general
Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common, such as the protein or proteins deposited in the brain or the part of the brain that's affected.	general
Some diseases look like dementias, such as those caused by a reaction to medications or vitamin deficiencies, and they might improve with treatment.	general
Progressive dementias Types of dementias that progress and aren't reversible include: Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.	general
Alzheimer's disease.	general
Although not all causes of Alzheimer's disease are known, experts do know that a small percentage are related to mutations of three genes, which can be passed down from parent to child.	general
While several different genes are probably involved in Alzheimer's disease, one important gene that increases risk is apolipoprotein E4 (APOE).	general
Alzheimer's disease patients have plaques and tangles in their brains.	general
Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid, and tangles are fibrous tangles made up of tau protein.	general
It's thought that these clumps damage healthy neurons and the fibers connecting them.	general
Other genetic factors might make it more likely that people will develop Alzheimer's.	general
This second most common type of dementia is caused by damage to the vessels that supply blood to your brain.	general
Blood vessel problems can cause strokes or damage the brain in other ways, such as by damaging the fibers in the white matter of the brain.	general
The most common symptoms of vascular dementia include difficulties with problem-solving, slowed thinking, focus and organization.	general
These tend to be more noticeable than memory loss.	general
Vascular dementia.	general
Lewy bodies are abnormal balloonlike clumps of protein that have been found in the brains of people with Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.	general
This is one of the more common types of progressive dementia.	general
Common signs and symptoms include acting out one's dreams in sleep, seeing things that aren't there (visual hallucinations), and problems with focus and attention.	general
Other signs include uncoordinated or slow movement, tremors, and rigidity (parkinsonism).	general
Lewy body dementia.	general
This is a group of diseases characterized by the breakdown (degeneration) of nerve cells and their connections in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, the areas generally associated with personality, behavior and language.	general
Common symptoms affect behavior, personality, thinking, judgment, and language and movement.	general
Frontotemporal dementia.	general
Autopsy studies of the brains of people 80 and older who had dementia indicate that many had a combination of several causes, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia.	general
Studies are ongoing to determine how having mixed dementia affects symptoms and treatments.	general
Mixed dementia.	general
Other disorders linked to dementia Caused by a genetic mutation, this disease causes certain nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord to waste away.	general
Signs and symptoms, including a severe decline in thinking (cognitive) skills, usually appear around age 30 or 40.	general
Huntington's disease.	general
This condition is most often caused by repetitive head trauma.	general
People such as boxers, football players or soldiers might experience TBI.	general
Traumatic brain injury (TBI).	general
Depending on the part of the brain that's injured, this condition can cause dementia signs and symptoms such as depression, explosiveness, memory loss and impaired speech.	general
TBI may also cause parkinsonism.	general
Symptoms might not appear until years after the trauma.	general
This rare brain disorder usually occurs in people without known risk factors.	general
This condition might be due to deposits of infectious proteins called prions.	general
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually has no known cause but can be inherited.	general
It may also be caused by exposure to diseased brain or nervous system tissue, such as from a cornea transplant.	general
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.	general
Signs and symptoms of this fatal condition usually appear after age 60.	general
Many people with Parkinson's disease eventually develop dementia symptoms (Parkinson's disease dementia).	general
Parkinson's disease.	general
Dementia-like conditions that can be reversed Some causes of dementia or dementia-like symptoms can be reversed with treatment.	general
They include: Dementia-like symptoms can result from fever or other side effects of your body's attempt to fight off an infection.	general
Multiple sclerosis and other conditions caused by the body's immune system attacking nerve cells also can cause dementia.	general
Infections and immune disorders.	general
People with thyroid problems, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), too little or too much sodium or calcium, or problems absorbing vitamin B-12 can develop dementia-like symptoms or other personality changes.	general
Metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities.	general
Not drinking enough liquids (dehydration); not getting enough thiamin (vitamin B-1), which is common in people with chronic alcoholism; and not getting enough vitamins B-6 and B-12 in your diet can cause dementia-like symptoms.	general
Copper and vitamin E deficiencies also can cause dementia symptoms.	general
Nutritional deficiencies.	general
Side effects of medications, a reaction to a medication or an interaction of several medications can cause dementia-like symptoms.	general
Medication side effects.	general
Bleeding between the surface of the brain and the covering over the brain, which is common in the elderly after a fall, can cause symptoms similar to those of dementia.	general
Subdural hematomas.	general
Exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, and other poisons, such as pesticides, as well as recreational drug or heavy alcohol use can lead to symptoms of dementia.	general
Symptoms might resolve with treatment.	general
Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain tumor.	general
Brain tumors.	general
This condition, also called hypoxia, occurs when organ tissues aren't getting enough oxygen.	general
Anoxia can occur due to severe sleep apneas, asthma, heart attack, carbon monoxide poisoning or other causes.	general
This condition, which is caused by enlarged ventricles in the brain, can cause walking problems, urinary difficulty and memory loss.	general
Normal-pressure hydrocephalus.	general
Risk factors Many factors can eventually contribute to dementia.	general
Some factors, such as age, can't be changed.	general
Others can be addressed to reduce your risk.	general
Risk factors that can't be changed The risk rises as you age, especially after age 65.	general
However, dementia isn't a normal part of aging, and dementia can occur in younger people.	general
Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition.	general
However, many people with a family history never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do.	general
There are tests to determine whether you have certain genetic mutations.	general
Family history.	general
By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease.	general
Down syndrome.	general
Risk factors you can change You might be able to control the following risk factors for dementia.	general
Research shows that lack of exercise increases the risk of dementia.	general
And while no specific diet is known to reduce dementia risk, research indicates a greater incidence of dementia in people who eat an unhealthy diet compared with those who follow a Mediterranean-style diet rich in produce, whole grains, nuts and seeds.	general
Diet and exercise.	general
If you drink large amounts of alcohol, you might have a higher risk of dementia.	general
While some studies have shown that moderate amounts of alcohol might have a protective effect, results are inconsistent.	general
The relationship between moderate amounts of alcohol and dementia risk isn't well-understood.	general
Heavy alcohol use.	general
These include high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, buildup of fats in your artery walls (atherosclerosis) and obesity.	general
Cardiovascular risk factors.	general
Although not yet well-understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia.	general
Depression.	general
Having diabetes may increase your risk of dementia, especially if it's poorly controlled.	general
Smoking might increase your risk of developing dementia and blood vessel (vascular) diseases.	general
People who snore and have episodes where they frequently stop breathing while asleep may have reversible memory loss.	general
Sleep apnea.	general
Low levels of vitamin D, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folate may increase your risk of dementia.	general
Vitamin and nutritional deficiencies.	general
Complications Dementia can affect many body systems and, therefore, the ability to function.	general
Dementia can lead to: Many people with dementia eventually reduce or stop eating, affecting their nutrient intake.	general
Ultimately, they may be unable to chew and swallow.	general
Poor nutrition.	general
Difficulty swallowing increases the risk of choking or aspirating food into the lungs, which can block breathing and cause pneumonia.	general
As dementia progresses, it can interfere with bathing, dressing, brushing hair or teeth, using the toilet independently, and taking medications accurately.	general
Inability to perform self-care tasks.	general
Some day-to-day situations can present safety issues for people with dementia, including driving, cooking and walking alone.	general
Personal safety challenges.	general
Late-stage dementia results in coma and death, often from infection.	general
There's no sure way to prevent dementia, but there are steps you can take that might help.	general
More research is needed, but it might be beneficial to do the following: Mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, solving puzzles and playing word games, and memory training might delay the onset of dementia and decrease its effects.	general
Keep your mind active.	general
Physical activity and social interaction might delay the onset of dementia and reduce its symptoms.	general
Move more and aim for 150 minutes of exercise a week.	general
Be physically and socially active.	general
Some studies have shown that smoking in middle age and beyond may increase your risk of dementia and blood vessel (vascular) conditions.	general
Quitting smoking might reduce your risk and will improve your health.	general
Quit smoking.	general
Some research suggests that people with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.	general
You can get vitamin D through certain foods, supplements and sun exposure.	general
Get enough vitamins.	general
More study is needed before an increase in vitamin D intake is recommended for preventing dementia, but it's a good idea to make sure you get adequate vitamin D. Taking a daily B-complex vitamin and vitamin C may also be helpful.	general
Treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and high body mass index (BMI).	general
High blood pressure might lead to a higher risk of some types of dementia.	general
More research is needed to determine whether treating high blood pressure may reduce the risk of dementia.	general
Manage cardiovascular risk factors.	general
See your doctor for treatment if you experience hearing loss, depression or anxiety.	general
Treat health conditions.	general
Eating a healthy diet is important for many reasons, but a diet such as the Mediterranean diet ‚Äî rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and omega-3 fatty acids, which are commonly found in certain fish and nuts ‚Äî might promote health and lower your risk of developing dementia.	general
This type of diet also improves cardiovascular health, which may help lower dementia risk.	general
Try eating fatty fish such as salmon three times a week, and a handful of nuts ‚Äî especially almonds and walnuts ‚Äî daily.	general
Maintain a healthy diet.	general
Practice good sleep hygiene, and talk to your doctor if you snore loudly or have periods where you stop breathing or gasp during sleep.	general
Get quality sleep.	general
Frontotemporal dementia is an umbrella term for a group of uncommon brain disorders that primarily affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.	general
These areas of the brain are generally associated with personality, behavior and language.	general
In frontotemporal dementia, portions of these lobes shrink (atrophy).	general
Signs and symptoms vary, depending on which part of the brain is affected.	general
Some people with frontotemporal dementia have dramatic changes in their personality and become socially inappropriate, impulsive or emotionally indifferent, while others lose the ability to use language properly.	general
Frontotemporal dementia is often misdiagnosed as a psychiatric problem or as Alzheimer's disease.	general
But frontotemporal dementia tends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimer's disease.	general
Frontotemporal dementia often begins between the ages of 40 and 65.	general
Signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia can be different from one individual to the next.	general
Signs and symptoms get progressively worse over time, usually over years.	general
Clusters of symptom types tend to occur together, and people may have more than one cluster of symptom types.	general
Behavioral changes The most common signs of frontotemporal dementia involve extreme changes in behavior and personality.	general
These include: Increasingly inappropriate social behavior Loss of empathy and other interpersonal skills, such as having sensitivity to another's feelings Lack of judgment Loss of inhibition Lack of interest (apathy), which can be mistaken for depression Repetitive compulsive behavior, such as tapping, clapping or smacking lips A decline in personal hygiene Changes in eating habits, usually overeating or developing a preference for sweets and carbohydrates Eating inedible objects Speech and language problems Some subtypes of frontotemporal dementia lead to language problems or impairment or loss of speech.	general
Primary progressive aphasia, semantic dementia and progressive agrammatic (nonfluent) aphasia are all considered to be frontotemporal dementia.	general
"Problems caused by these conditions include: Increasing difficulty in using and understanding written and spoken language, such as having trouble finding the right word to use in speech or naming objects Trouble naming things, possibly replacing a specific word with a more general word such as ""it"" for pen No longer knowing word meanings Having hesitant speech that may sound telegraphic Making mistakes in sentence construction Movement disorders Rarer subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are characterized by problems with movement, similar to those associated with Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."	general
Movement-related problems may include: In frontotemporal dementia, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain shrink.	general
In addition, certain substances accumulate in the brain.	general
What causes these changes is usually unknown.	general
There are genetic mutations that have been linked to frontotemporal dementia.	general
But more than half of the people who develop frontotemporal dementia have no family history of dementia.	general
Recently, researchers have confirmed shared genetics and molecular pathways between frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).	general
More research needs to be done to understand the connection between these conditions, however.	general
Risk factors Your risk of developing frontotemporal dementia is higher if you have a family history of dementia.	general
There are no other known risk factors.	general
Lewy body dementia, also known as dementia with Lewy bodies, is the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's disease dementia.	general
Protein deposits, called Lewy bodies, develop in nerve cells in the brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement (motor control).	general
Lewy body dementia causes a progressive decline in mental abilities.	general
People with Lewy body dementia may experience visual hallucinations and changes in alertness and attention.	general
Other effects include Parkinson's disease-like signs and symptoms such as rigid muscles, slow movement and tremors.	general
Products & Services Lewy body dementia signs and symptoms may include: Hallucinations may be one of the first symptoms, and they often recur.	general
They may include seeing shapes, animals or people that aren't there.	general
Sound (auditory), smell (olfactory) or touch (tactile) hallucinations are possible.	general
Visual hallucinations.	general
Signs of Parkinson's disease (parkinsonian signs), such as slowed movement, rigid muscles, tremor or a shuffling walk may occur.	general
This can also result in falls.	general
Movement disorders.	general
Blood pressure, pulse, sweating and the digestive process are regulated by a part of the nervous system that is often affected by Lewy body dementia.	general
This can result in dizziness, falls and bowel issues such as constipation.	general
Poor regulation of body functions (autonomic nervous system).	general
You may experience thinking (cognitive) problems similar to those of Alzheimer's disease, such as confusion, poor attention, visual-spatial problems and memory loss.	general
Cognitive problems.	general
You may have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, which can cause you to physically act out your dreams while you're asleep.	general
Sleep difficulties.	general
Episodes of drowsiness, long periods of staring into space, long naps during the day or disorganized speech are possible.	general
Fluctuating attention.	general
You may experience depression sometime during the course of your illness.	general
Depression.	general
You may have loss of motivation.	general
Lewy body dementia is characterized by the abnormal buildup of proteins into masses known as Lewy bodies.	general
This protein is also associated with Parkinson's disease.	general
People who have Lewy bodies in their brains also have the plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease.	general
Risk factors A few factors seem to increase the risk of developing Lewy body dementia, including: People older than 60 are at greater risk.	general
Lewy body dementia affects more men than women.	general
Those who have a family member with Lewy body dementia or Parkinson's disease are at greater risk.	general
Family history.	general
Complications Lewy body dementia is progressive.	general
Vascular dementia is a general term describing problems with reasoning, planning, judgment, memory and other thought processes caused by brain damage from impaired blood flow to your brain.	general
You can develop vascular dementia after a stroke blocks an artery in your brain, but strokes don't always cause vascular dementia.	general
Whether a stroke affects your thinking and reasoning depends on your stroke's severity and location.	general
Vascular dementia can also result from other conditions that damage blood vessels and reduce circulation, depriving your brain of vital oxygen and nutrients.	general
Factors that increase your risk of heart disease and stroke ‚Äî including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking ‚Äî also raise your vascular dementia risk.	general
Controlling these factors may help lower your chances of developing vascular dementia.	general
Products & Services Vascular dementia symptoms vary, depending on the part of your brain where blood flow is impaired.	general
Symptoms often overlap with those of other types of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease dementia.	general
Vascular dementia signs and symptoms include: Reduced ability to organize thoughts or actions Decline in ability to analyze a situation, develop an effective plan and communicate that plan to others Difficulty deciding what to do next Problems with memory Restlessness and agitation Unsteady gait Sudden or frequent urge to urinate or inability to control passing urine Depression or apathy Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear-cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke.	general
When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementia.	general
Sometimes a characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms follows a series of strokes or ministrokes.	general
Changes in your thought processes occur in noticeable steps downward from your previous level of function, unlike the gradual, steady decline that typically occurs in Alzheimer's disease dementia.	general
But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer's disease dementia.	general
What's more, vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease often occur together.	general
Studies show that many people with dementia and evidence of brain vascular disease also have Alzheimer's disease.	general
Vascular dementia results from conditions that damage your brain's blood vessels, reducing their ability to supply your brain with the amounts of nutrition and oxygen it needs to perform thought processes effectively.	general
Common conditions that may lead to vascular dementia include: Strokes that block a brain artery usually cause a range of symptoms that may include vascular dementia.	general
But some strokes don't cause any noticeable symptoms.	general
These silent strokes still increase dementia risk.	general
Stroke (infarction) blocking a brain artery.	general
With both silent and apparent strokes, the risk of vascular dementia increases with the number of strokes that occur over time.	general
One type of vascular dementia involving many strokes is called multi-infarct dementia.	general
Conditions that narrow or inflict long-term damage on your brain blood vessels also can lead to vascular dementia.	general
These conditions include the wear and tear associated with aging, high blood pressure, abnormal aging of blood vessels (atherosclerosis), diabetes, and brain hemorrhage.	general
Narrowed or chronically damaged brain blood vessels.	general
Risk factors In general, the risk factors for vascular dementia are the same as those for heart disease and stroke.	general
Risk factors for vascular dementia include: Your risk of vascular dementia rises as you grow older.	general
The disorder is rare before age 65, and the risk rises substantially by your 90s.	general
Increasing age.	general
If you've had a heart attack, you may be at increased risk of having blood vessel problems in your brain.	general
The brain damage that occurs with a stroke or a ministroke (transient ischemic attack) may increase your risk of developing dementia.	general
History of heart attack, strokes or ministrokes.	general
This condition occurs when deposits of cholesterol and other substances (plaques) build up in your arteries and narrow your blood vessels.	general
Atherosclerosis can increase your risk of vascular dementia by reducing the flow of blood that nourishes your brain.	general
Abnormal aging of blood vessels (atherosclerosis).	general
"Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the ""bad"" cholesterol, are associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia."	general
High cholesterol.	general
When your blood pressure's too high, it puts extra stress on blood vessels everywhere in your body, including your brain.	general
This increases the risk of vascular problems in the brain.	general
High blood pressure.	general
High glucose levels damage blood vessels throughout your body.	general
Damage in brain blood vessels can increase your risk of stroke and vascular dementia.	general
Smoking directly damages your blood vessels, increasing your risk of atherosclerosis and other circulatory diseases, including vascular dementia.	general
Being overweight is a well-known risk factor for vascular diseases in general, and therefore, presumably increases your risk of vascular dementia.	general
In this abnormal heart rhythm, the upper chambers of your heart begin to beat rapidly and irregularly, out of coordination with your heart's lower chambers.	general
Atrial fibrillation increases your risk of stroke because it causes blood clots to form in the heart that can break off and go to the brain blood vessels.	general
Atrial fibrillation.	general
The health of your brain's blood vessels is closely linked to your overall heart health.	general
Taking these steps to keep your heart healthy may also help reduce your risk of vascular dementia: Keeping your blood pressure in the normal range may help prevent both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.	general
Maintain a healthy blood pressure.	general
Avoiding the onset of type 2 diabetes, with diet and exercise, is another possible way to decrease your risk of dementia.	general
If you already have diabetes, controlling your glucose levels may help protect your brain blood vessels from damage.	general
Prevent or control diabetes.	general
Smoking tobacco damages blood vessels everywhere in your body.	general
Quit smoking.	general
Regular physical activity should be a key part of everyone's wellness plan.	general
In addition to all of its other benefits, exercise may help you avoid vascular dementia.	general
Get physical exercise.	general
A healthy, low-fat diet and cholesterol-lowering medications if you need them may reduce your risk of strokes and heart attacks that could lead to vascular dementia, probably by reducing the amount of plaque deposits building up inside your brain's arteries.	general
Keep your cholesterol in check.	general
Dengue (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world.	general
Mild dengue fever causes a high fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain.	general
A severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause severe bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.	general
Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year.	general
Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific islands, but the disease has been increasing rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean.	general
Researchers are working on dengue fever vaccines.	general
For now the best prevention is to reduce mosquito habitat in areas where dengue fever is common.	general
Many people, especially children and teens, may experience no signs or symptoms during a mild case of dengue fever.	general
When symptoms do occur, they usually begin four to seven days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito.	general
Dengue fever causes a high fever ‚Äî 104 F degrees ‚Äî and at least two of the following symptoms: Most people recover within a week or so.	general
In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening.	general
Blood vessels often become damaged and leaky.	general
And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops.	general
This can cause a severe form of dengue fever, called dengue hemorrhagic fever, severe dengue or dengue shock syndrome.	general
Signs and symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever or severe dengue ‚Äî a life-threatening emergency ‚Äî include: Severe abdominal pain Blood in your urine, stools or vomit Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising Difficult or rapid breathing When to see a doctor Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room if you've recently visited a region in which dengue fever is known to occur and you develop emergency symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing, or blood in your nose, gums, vomit or stools.	general
If you develop a fever and milder symptoms common to dengue fever, call your doctor.	general
Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses spread by mosquitoes that thrive in and near human lodgings.	general
When a mosquito bites a person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito.	general
When the infected mosquito then bites another person, the virus enters that person's bloodstream.	general
After you've recovered from dengue fever, you have immunity to the type of virus that infected you ‚Äî but not to the other three dengue fever virus types.	general
The risk of developing severe dengue fever, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, actually increases if you're infected a second, third or fourth time.	general
Risk factors Factors that put you at greater risk of developing dengue fever or a more severe form of the disease include: Being in tropical and subtropical areas increases your risk of exposure to the virus that causes dengue fever.	general
Especially high-risk areas are Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and the Caribbean.	general
Living or traveling in tropical areas.	general
Previous infection with a dengue fever virus increases your risk of having severe symptoms if you're infected again.	general
Prior infection with a dengue fever virus.	general
Complications If severe, dengue fever can damage the lungs, liver or heart.	general
Blood pressure can drop to dangerous levels, causing shock and, in some cases, death.	general
One dengue fever vaccine, Dengvaxia, is currently approved for use in those ages 9 to 45 who live in areas with a high incidence of dengue fever.	general
The vaccine is given in three doses over the course of 12 months.	general
Dengvaxia prevents dengue infections slightly more than half the time.	general
The vaccine is approved only for older children because younger vaccinated children appear to be at increased risk of severe dengue fever and hospitalization two years after receiving the vaccine.	general
The World Health Organization stresses that the vaccine is not an effective tool, on its own, to reduce dengue fever in areas where the illness is common.	general
Controlling the mosquito population and human exposure is still the most critical part of prevention efforts.	general
So for now, if you're living or traveling in an area where dengue fever is known to be, the best way to avoid dengue fever is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes that carry the disease.	general
If you are living or traveling in tropical areas where dengue fever is common, these tips may help reduce your risk of mosquito bites: The mosquitoes that carry the dengue viruses are most active from dawn to dusk, but they can also bite at night.	general
Stay in air-conditioned or well-screened housing.	general
When you go into mosquito-infested areas, wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and shoes.	general
Wear protective clothing.	general
Permethrin can be applied to your clothing, shoes, camping gear and bed netting.	general
You can also buy clothing made with permethrin already in it.	general
For your skin, use a repellent containing at least a 10 percent concentration of DEET.	general
Use mosquito repellent.	general
The mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus typically live in and around houses, breeding in standing water that can collect in such things as used automobile tires.	general
You can help lower mosquito populations by eliminating habitats where they lay their eggs.	general
At least once a week, empty and clean containers that hold standing water, such as planting containers, animal dishes and flower vases.	general
Keep standing water containers covered between cleanings.	general
Reduce mosquito habitat.	general
A personality disorder is a type of mental disorder in which you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, functioning and behaving.	general
A person with a personality disorder has trouble perceiving and relating to situations and people.	general
This causes significant problems and limitations in relationships, social activities, work and school.	general
In some cases, you may not realize that you have a personality disorder because your way of thinking and behaving seems natural to you.	general
And you may blame others for the challenges you face.	general
Personality disorders usually begin in the teenage years or early adulthood.	general
There are many types of personality disorders.	general
Some types may become less obvious throughout middle age.	general
Types of personality disorders are grouped into three clusters, based on similar characteristics and symptoms.	general
Many people with one personality disorder also have signs and symptoms of at least one additional personality disorder.	general
It's not necessary to exhibit all the signs and symptoms listed for a disorder to be diagnosed.	general

But it can also result in something you might not expect ‚Äî depression.	general
"Most new moms experience postpartum ""baby blues"" after childbirth, which commonly include mood swings, crying spells, anxiety and difficulty sleeping."	general
Baby blues typically begin within the first two to three days after delivery, and may last for up to two weeks.	general
But some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression.	general
Rarely, an extreme mood disorder called postpartum psychosis also may develop after childbirth.	general
Postpartum depression isn't a character flaw or a weakness.	general
Sometimes it's simply a complication of giving birth.	general
If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms and help you bond with your baby.	general

Symptoms usually develop within the first few weeks after giving birth, but may begin earlier ‚Äï during pregnancy ‚Äï or later ‚Äî up to a year after birth.	general
Postpartum depression signs and symptoms may include: Depressed mood or severe mood swings Excessive crying Loss of appetite or eating much more than usual Inability to sleep (insomnia) or sleeping too much Overwhelming fatigue or loss of energy Reduced interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy Intense irritability and anger Hopelessness Diminished ability to think clearly, concentrate or make decisions Restlessness Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide Untreated, postpartum depression may last for many months or longer.	general

Daily cleansing with a gentle soap and shampoo can help reduce oiliness and dead skin buildup.	general
Seborrheic dermatitis is also called dandruff, seborrheic eczema and seborrheic psoriasis.	general
For infants, the condition is known as cradle cap and causes crusty, scaly patches on the scalp.	general
Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin disorder that mainly affects the scalp, causing itchy, yellow or white patchy scales or thick crusts that may attach to the hair shaft, as seen in the lower left side of the image.	general
Cradle cap on light skin Cradle cap on light skin Cradle cap is characterized by scaly patches on a baby's scalp.	general
You may notice thick, yellow patches of skin.	general
The patches may be crusty or greasy.	general
Cradle cap on dark skin Cradle cap on dark skin Cradle cap appears as patchy scaling or thick crusts on the scalp and greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales.	general
Cradle cap usually doesn't bother the infant.	general
Seborrheic dermatitis signs and symptoms may include: Skin flakes (dandruff) on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache Patches of greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales or crust on the scalp, face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids, chest, armpits, groin area or under the breasts The signs and symptoms may be more severe if you're stressed, and they tend to flare in cold, dry seasons.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if: You're so uncomfortable that you're losing sleep or being distracted from your daily routines Your condition is causing embarrassment and anxiety Doctors don't yet know the exact cause of seborrheic dermatitis.	general
As dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans grows, lumps of tissue (protuberans) may form near the surface of the skin.	general
Skin anatomy Skin anatomy Your skin has three layers that house your sweat and oil glands, hair follicles, melanocytes, and blood vessels.	general
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a very rare type of skin cancer that begins in connective tissue cells in the middle layer of your skin (dermis).	general
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans may at first appear as a bruise or scar.	general
As it grows, lumps of tissue (protuberans) may form near the surface of the skin.	general
This skin cancer often forms on the arms, legs and trunk.	general
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans grows slowly and rarely spreads beyond the skin.	general
Tests and procedures used to diagnose dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans include: Your doctor will carefully inspect your skin to understand your condition.	general
Skin examination.	general
Your doctor will remove a small amount of tissue for testing.	general
Specialized laboratory tests can determine if cancer cells are present.	general
Skin biopsy.	general
In certain cases, your doctor may recommend imaging tests, such as an MRI, to better understand the extent of your cancer and to help with treatment planning.	general
Imaging tests.	general
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans treatment typically involves surgery to remove the cancer.	general
Other treatments may be used to kill cancer cells that might remain after surgery.	general
Treatment options may include: For most cancers, your doctor may recommend a procedure to remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue that surrounds it (excisional surgery with a normal margin of tissue).	general
This makes it more likely that all of the cancer cells are removed during surgery.	general
Surgery to remove the cancer.	general
Mohs surgery is a specialized type of surgery that involves progressively removing thin layers of cancer-containing skin until only cancer-free tissue remains.	general
After each layer of skin is removed, it's examined for signs of cancer.	general
The process continues until there are no signs of cancer.	general
Mohs surgery.	general
Mohs surgery may be particularly helpful for treating larger cancers because dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tends to grow in an irregular shape that makes it difficult to remove completely.	general
Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells.	general
Your doctor may recommend radiation therapy if all of your cancer couldn't be removed during surgery.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack cancer cells by focusing on particular traits that make them vulnerable.	general
Some people with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans have cancer cells that produce an excess protein.	general
A drug called imatinib (Gleevec) can target those cells and cause them to die.	general
Your doctor may recommend this treatment if your cancer returns after surgery.	general
Targeted therapy.	general
Clinical trials to test new treatments may be an option.	general
Ask your doctor whether you're eligible to participate in a clinical trial.	general
Clinical trials.	general
Dermatographia Dermatographia Dermatographia is a condition in which lightly scratching your skin causes raised, red lines where you've scratched.	general
Though not serious, it can be uncomfortable.	general
Dermatographia is a condition also known as skin writing.	general
When people who have dermatographia lightly scratch their skin, the scratches redden into a raised wheal similar to hives.	general
These marks usually disappear within 30 minutes.	general
The cause of dermatographia is unknown, but it can be triggered in some people by infections, emotional upset or medications such as penicillin.	general
Most people who have dermatographia don't seek treatment.	general
If your signs and symptoms are especially bothersome, your doctor may recommend allergy medications such as cetirizine (Zyrtec) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl).	general
Raised red lines The signs and symptoms may occur within a few minutes of your skin being rubbed or scratched and usually disappear within 30 minutes.	general
Rarely, dermatographia develops more slowly and lasts several hours to several days.	general
The condition itself can last for months or years.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if your signs and symptoms are particularly bothersome.	general
The exact cause of dermatographia isn't clear.	general
It may be caused by an allergic response, yet no specific allergen has been identified.	general
Simple things can trigger symptoms of dermatographia.	general
For example, rubbing from your clothes or bedsheets may irritate your skin.	general
Sometimes, dermatographia is preceded by an infection, emotional upset or medications, such as penicillin.	general
Risk factors Dermatographia can occur at any age, but it tends to be more common in teenagers and young adults.	general
If you have other skin conditions, such as dry skin or dermatitis, you may be more susceptible to dermatographia.	general
Any skin condition that causes a frequent urge to scratch may increase your risk.	general
To reduce discomfort and prevent the symptoms of dermatographia, try these tips: Refrain from using harsh soaps on your skin.	general
Don't wear clothing made of itchy material, such as wool.	general
Hot showers or baths may worsen the symptoms.	general
Avoid irritating your skin.	general
If you have dermatographia or other skin conditions that may cause frequent itching, try to avoid scratching your skin.	general
Scratching will aggravate the condition.	general
Don't scratch your skin.	general
Dry skin tends to make skin itchy.	general
Keep your skin moisturized by using lotions and creams after bathing.	general
Keep your skin moisturized.	general
Dermatomyositis (dur-muh-toe-my-uh-SY-tis) is an uncommon inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a distinctive skin rash.	general
The condition can affect adults and children.	general
In adults, dermatomyositis usually occurs from the late 40s to early 60s.	general
In children, it most often appears between 5 and 15 years of age.	general
Dermatomyositis affects more females than males.	general
There's no cure for dermatomyositis, but periods of symptom improvement (remission) can occur.	general
Treatment can clear the skin rash and help you regain muscle strength and function.	general
Products & Services The most common signs and symptoms of dermatomyositis include: A violet-colored or dusky red rash develops, most commonly on your face and eyelids and on knuckles, elbows, knees, chest and back.	general
The rash, which can be itchy and painful, is often the first sign of dermatomyositis.	general
Skin changes.	general
Progressive muscle weakness involves the muscles closest to the trunk, such as those in your hips, thighs, shoulders, upper arms and neck.	general
The weakness affects both the left and right sides of your body, and tends to gradually worsen.	general
Muscle weakness.	general
When to see a doctor Seek medical attention if you develop muscle weakness or an unexplained rash.	general
The cause of dermatomyositis is unknown, but the disease has much in common with autoimmune disorders, in which your immune system mistakenly attacks your body tissues.	general
Small blood vessels in muscular tissue are particularly affected in dermatomyositis.	general
Inflammatory cells surround the blood vessels and eventually lead to destruction of muscle fibers.	general
Complications Possible complications of dermatomyositis include: If the muscles in your esophagus are affected, you can have problems swallowing (dysphagia), which can cause weight loss and malnutrition.	general
Difficulty swallowing.	general
Difficulty swallowing can also cause you to breathe food or liquids, including saliva, into your lungs (aspiration).	general
Aspiration pneumonia.	general
If the condition affects your chest muscles, you might have breathing problems, such as shortness of breath.	general
Breathing problems.	general
These can occur in your muscles, skin and connective tissues (calcinosis) as the disease progresses.	general
These deposits are more common in children with dermatomyositis and develop earlier in the course of the disease.	general
Calcium deposits.	general
Associated conditions Dermatomyositis may cause other conditions or put you at higher risk of developing them, including: This condition causes your fingers, toes, cheeks, nose and ears to turn pale when exposed to cold temperatures.	general
Raynaud's phenomenon.	general
Other conditions, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and Sjogren's syndrome, can occur with dermatomyositis (overlap syndromes).	general
Other connective tissue diseases.	general
Dermatomyositis can cause heart muscle inflammation (myocarditis).	general
In a small number of people who have dermatomyositis, congestive heart failure and heart arrhythmias develop.	general
Cardiovascular disease.	general
Interstitial lung disease can occur with dermatomyositis.	general
Interstitial lung disease refers to a group of disorders that cause scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue, making the lungs stiff and inelastic.	general
Signs and symptoms include a dry cough and shortness of breath.	general
Lung disease.	general
Dermatomyositis in adults has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing cancer, particularly of the cervix, lungs, pancreas, breasts, ovaries and gastrointestinal tract.	general
Risk of cancer increases with age, although it appears to level off three years or so after a diagnosis of dermatomyositis.	general
Dermatomyositis can also develop after you receive a diagnosis of cancer.	general
Desmoid tumors are noncancerous growths that occur in the connective tissue.	general
Desmoid tumors most often occur in the abdomen, arms and legs.	general
Another term for desmoid tumors is aggressive fibromatosis.	general
Desmoid tumors that grow can extend to involve nearby tissues and organs, causing signs, symptoms and complications.	general
Treatment may involve surgery to remove the desmoid tumor, when possible.	general
Sometimes the tumor can't be removed without damaging nearby structures.	general
In these cases, other treatments may be recommended.	general
Desmoplastic (des-moe-PLAS-tik) small round cell tumors are a type of soft tissue cancer that typically begins in the abdomen.	general
Rarely, this type of cancer can occur in other parts of the body.	general
Desmoplastic small round cell tumors occur most often in young men and boys, though they can occur at any age and can also affect women.	general
These aggressive cancers often form as multiple tumors in the tissue (peritoneum) that lines the inside of the abdomen and pelvis.	general
They quickly spread to other structures within the abdomen.	general
Desmoplastic small round cell tumors are a type of soft tissue sarcoma.	general
Treatment for desmoplastic small round cell tumors typically involves a combination of treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.	general
Retinal detachment Retinal detachment Retinal detachment describes an emergency situation in which a thin layer of tissue (the retina) at the back of the eye pulls away from the layer of blood vessels that provides it with oxygen and nutrients.	general
Retinal detachment is often accompanied by flashes and floaters in your vision.	general
Retinal detachment describes an emergency situation in which a thin layer of tissue (the retina) at the back of the eye pulls away from its normal position.	general
Retinal detachment separates the retinal cells from the layer of blood vessels that provides oxygen and nourishment.	general
The longer retinal detachment goes untreated, the greater your risk of permanent vision loss in the affected eye.	general
Warning signs of retinal detachment may include one or all of the following: the sudden appearance of floaters and flashes and reduced vision.	general
Contacting an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) right away can help save your vision.	general
Products & Services Retinal detachment itself is painless.	general
But warning signs almost always appear before it occurs or has advanced, such as: The sudden appearance of many floaters ‚Äî tiny specks that seem to drift through your field of vision Flashes of light in one or both eyes (photopsia) Blurred vision A curtain-like shadow over your visual field When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical attention if you are experiencing the signs or symptoms of retinal detachment.	general
Retinal detachment is a medical emergency in which you can permanently lose your vision.	general
Mayo Clinic Minute: What are eye floaters?	general
Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: What are eye floaters?	general
Having vision problems?	general
Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes?	general
It could be eye floaters.	general
"""In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called 'the vitreous."	general
' When we're young, it's a firm clump of jelly.	general
As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces.	general
"Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floaters,"" says Dr. Khan."	general
Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you're nearsighted.	general
The biggest concern ‚Äì they can cause retinal tears.	general
"""If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall,"" says Dr. Khan."	general
"""And that's a retinal detachment""."	general
And that can cause blindness, which is why it's especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision.	general
Most eye floaters don't require treatment, but your eye doctor likely will recommend regular eye exams to ensure the condition doesn't worsen.	general
There are three different types of retinal detachment: These types of retinal detachments are the most common.	general
Rhegmatogenous detachments are caused by a hole or tear in the retina that allows fluid to pass through and collect underneath the retina, pulling the retina away from underlying tissues.	general
The areas where the retina detaches lose their blood supply and stop working, causing you to lose vision.	general
Rhegmatogenous (reg-ma-TODGE-uh-nus).	general
The most common cause of rhegmatogenous detachment is aging.	general
As you age, the gel-like material that fills the inside of your eye, known as the vitreous (VIT-ree-us), may change in consistency and shrink or become more liquid.	general
Normally, the vitreous separates from the surface of the retina without any complications ‚Äî a common condition called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).	general
One complication of this separation is a tear.	general
As the vitreous separates or peels off the retina, it may tug on the retina with enough force to create a retinal tear.	general
Left untreated, the liquid vitreous can pass through the tear into the space behind the retina, causing the retina to become detached.	general
This type of detachment can occur when scar tissue grows on the retina's surface, causing the retina to pull away from the back of the eye.	general
Tractional detachment is typically seen in people who have poorly controlled diabetes or other conditions.	general
Tractional.	general
In this type of detachment, fluid accumulates beneath the retina, but there are no holes or tears in the retina.	general
Exudative detachment can be caused by age-related macular degeneration, injury to the eye, tumors or inflammatory disorders.	general
Risk factors The following factors increase your risk of retinal detachment: Aging ‚Äî retinal detachment is more common in people over age 50 Previous retinal detachment in one eye Family history of retinal detachment Extreme nearsightedness (myopia) Previous severe eye injury Previous other eye disease or disorder, including retinoschisis, uveitis or thinning of the peripheral retina (lattice degeneration) The Mayo Clinic experience and patient stories Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced.	general

Deviated septum Deviated septum A deviated septum occurs when your nasal septum is significantly displaced to one side, making one nasal air passage smaller than the other.	general
A deviated septum occurs when the thin wall (nasal septum) between your nasal passages is displaced to one side.	general
In many people, the nasal septum is off-center ‚Äî or deviated ‚Äî making one nasal passage smaller.	general
When a deviated septum is severe, it can block one side of your nose and reduce airflow, causing difficulty breathing.	general
The additional exposure of a deviated septum to the drying effect of airflow through the nose may sometimes contribute to crusting or bleeding in certain people.	general
A nasal blockage or congestion (obstruction) can occur from a deviated nasal septum, from swelling of the tissues lining the nose or from both.	general
Treatment of nasal obstruction may include medications to reduce the swelling or nasal dilators that help open the nasal passages.	general
You'll need surgery to correct a deviated septum.	general
Most septal deformities result in no symptoms, and you may not even know you have a deviated septum.	general
Some septal deformities, however, may cause the following signs and symptoms: This blockage (obstruction) can make it difficult to breathe through the nostril or nostrils.	general
You may notice this more when you have a cold (upper respiratory tract infection) or allergies that can cause your nasal passages to swell and narrow.	general
Obstruction of one or both nostrils.	general
The surface of your nasal septum may become dry, increasing your risk of nosebleeds.	general
Nosebleeds.	general
There is some debate about the possible nasal causes of facial pain.	general
A possible cause of one-sided facial pain could be a severe deviated septum in which surfaces within the nose touch and cause pressure.	general
Facial pain.	general
A deviated septum or swelling of the intranasal tissues can be one of the many reasons for noisy breathing during sleep.	general
Noisy breathing during sleep.	general
It is normal for the nose to alternate being obstructed on one side, then change to being obstructed on the other.	general
This is called the nasal cycle.	general
The nasal cycle is normal, but being aware of the nasal cycle isn't typical and can indicate nasal obstruction.	general
Awareness of the nasal cycle.	general
Some people may prefer to sleep on a particular side in order to optimize breathing through the nose at night if one nasal passage is narrowed.	general
Preference for sleeping on a particular side.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience: A blocked nostril (or nostrils) that doesn't respond to treatment Frequent nosebleeds A deviated septum occurs when your nasal septum ‚Äî the thin wall that separates your right and left nasal passages ‚Äî is displaced to one side.	general
A deviated septum can be caused by: In some cases, a deviated septum occurs during fetal development and is apparent at birth.	general
A condition present at birth.	general
A deviated septum can also be the result of an injury that causes the nasal septum to be moved out of position.	general
Injury to the nose.	general
In infants, such an injury may occur during childbirth.	general
In children and adults, a wide array of accidents may lead to a nose injury and deviated septum.	general
Trauma to the nose most commonly occurs during contact sports, rough play such as wrestling or automobile accidents.	general
The normal aging process may affect nasal structures, worsening a deviated septum over time.	general
Swelling and irritation of the nasal cavities (rhinitis) or sinus cavities (rhinosinusitis) also can further narrow the nasal passage from a deviated septum, resulting in nasal obstruction.	general
Risk factors For some people, a deviated septum is present at birth ‚Äî occurring during fetal development or due to injury during childbirth.	general
After birth, a deviated septum is most commonly caused by an injury that moves your nasal septum out of place.	general
Risk factors include: Playing contact sports Not wearing your seat belt while riding in a motorized vehicle Complications If you have a severely deviated septum causing nasal blockage (obstruction), it can lead to: due to chronic mouth breathing or congestion in your nasal passages A feeling of pressure due to the unpleasantness of not being able to breathe comfortably through your nose at night Disturbed sleep, You may be able to prevent the injuries to your nose that can cause a deviated septum with these precautions: or a midface mask when playing contact sports, such as football and volleyball.	general

Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose).	general
Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues.	general
It's also your brain's main source of fuel.	general
The underlying cause of diabetes varies by type.	general
But, no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in your blood.	general
Too much sugar in your blood can lead to serious health problems.	general
Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.	general
Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes ‚Äî when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes ‚Äî and gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy but may resolve after the baby is delivered.	general
Products & Services Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated.	general
Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not experience symptoms initially.	general
In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.	general
Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst Frequent urination Extreme hunger Unexplained weight loss Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin) Irritability Blurred vision Slow-healing sores Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence.	general
Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.	general
When to see a doctor If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor.	general
The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.	general
If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes.	general
After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize.	general
If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes.	general
More Information To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body.	general
How insulin works Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas).	general
The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.	general
The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.	general
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.	general
As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.	general
The role of glucose Glucose ‚Äî a sugar ‚Äî is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.	general
Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.	general
Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.	general
Your liver stores and makes glucose.	general
When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range.	general
Causes of type 1 diabetes The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown.	general
What is known is that your immune system ‚Äî which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses ‚Äî attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.	general
This leaves you with little or no insulin.	general
Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.	general
Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear.	general
Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes.	general
Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes In prediabetes ‚Äî which can lead to type 2 diabetes ‚Äî and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance.	general
Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.	general
Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too.	general
Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight.	general
Causes of gestational diabetes During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy.	general
These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin.	general
Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance.	general
But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up.	general
When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.	general
More Information Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes.	general
Risk factors for type 1 diabetes Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes.	general
Family history.	general
Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes.	general
Environmental factors.	general
Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies.	general
If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes.	general
But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.	general
The presence of damaging immune system cells (autoantibodies).	general
Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes.	general
Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't.	general
It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin.	general
The less active you are, the greater your risk.	general
Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.	general
Inactivity.	general
Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.	general
Family history.	general
Although it's unclear why, people of certain races ‚Äî including black people, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans ‚Äî are at higher risk.	general
Your risk increases as you get older.	general
This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age.	general
But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults.	general
If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later increases.	general
If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes.	general
Gestational diabetes.	general
For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome ‚Äî a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity ‚Äî increases the risk of diabetes.	general
Polycystic ovary syndrome.	general
Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.	general
High blood pressure.	general
"If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher."	general
Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood.	general
People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.	general
Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are.	general
Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels.	general
Risk factors for gestational diabetes Any pregnant woman can develop gestational diabetes, but some women are at greater risk than are others.	general
Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Women older than age 25 are at increased risk.	general
Your risk increases if you have prediabetes ‚Äî a precursor to type 2 diabetes ‚Äî or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes.	general
You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth.	general
Family or personal history.	general
Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk.	general
For reasons that aren't clear, women who are black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.	general
Complications Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually.	general
The longer you have diabetes ‚Äî and the less controlled your blood sugar ‚Äî the higher the risk of complications.	general
Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening.	general
Possible complications include: Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis).	general
If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke.	general
Cardiovascular disease.	general
Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs.	general
This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.	general
Nerve damage (neuropathy).	general
Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs.	general
Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.	general
For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction.	general
The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood.	general
Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system.	general
Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.	general
Kidney damage (nephropathy).	general
Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness.	general
Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.	general
Eye damage (retinopathy).	general
Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications.	general
Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly.	general
These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation.	general
Foot damage.	general
Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.	general
Skin conditions.	general
Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.	general
Hearing impairment.	general
Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease.	general
The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be.	general
Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved.	general
Alzheimer's disease.	general
Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.	general
Depression can affect diabetes management.	general
Depression.	general
Complications of gestational diabetes Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies.	general
However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby.	general
can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Complications in your baby Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin.	general
This can cause your baby to grow too large (macrosomia).	general
Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth.	general
Excess growth.	general
Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high.	general
Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal.	general
Low blood sugar.	general
Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.	general
Type 2 diabetes later in life.	general
Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.	general
also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Complications in the mother This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet.	general
Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby.	general
Preeclampsia.	general
Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy.	general
You're also more likely to develop diabetes ‚Äî typically type 2 diabetes ‚Äî as you get older.	general
Subsequent gestational diabetes.	general
Complications of prediabetes More Information Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented.	general
However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber.	general
Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.	general
Strive for variety to prevent boredom.	general
Eat healthy foods.	general
Aim for 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day.	general
Take a brisk daily walk.	general
Ride your bike.	general
Swim laps.	general
If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions spread throughout the day.	general
Get more physical activity.	general
If you're overweight, losing even 7 percent of your body weight ‚Äî for example, 14 pounds (6.	general
4 kilograms) if you weigh 200 pounds (90.	general
7 kilograms) ‚Äî can reduce the risk of diabetes.	general
Lose excess pounds.	general
Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however.	general
Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy.	general
To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits.	general
Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem.	general
Sometimes medication is an option as well.	general
Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others) may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes ‚Äî but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential.	general
Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.	general
Diabetes insipidus (die-uh-BEE-teze in-SIP-uh-dus) is an uncommon disorder that causes an imbalance of fluids in the body.	general
This imbalance makes you very thirsty even if you've had something to drink.	general
It also leads you to produce large amounts of urine.	general
"While the terms ""diabetes insipidus"" and ""diabetes mellitus"" sound similar, they're not related."	general
Diabetes mellitus ‚Äî which can occur as type 1 or type 2 ‚Äî is the more common form of diabetes.	general
There's no cure for diabetes insipidus.	general
But treatments can relieve your thirst and decrease your urine output.	general
Extreme thirst Frequent need to get up to urinate during the night Preference for cold drinks If your condition is serious, urine output can be as much as 20 quarts (about 19 liters) a day if you're drinking a lot of fluids.	general
A healthy adult typically urinates an average of 1 or 2 quarts (about 1 to 2 liters) a day.	general
An infant or young child with diabetes insipidus may have the following signs and symptoms: Heavy, wet diapers When to see a doctor See your doctor immediately if you notice excessive urination and extreme thirst.	general
Female urinary system Female urinary system Your urinary system ‚Äî which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra ‚Äî is responsible for removing waste from your body through urine.	general
Your kidneys, located toward the back in your upper abdomen, produce urine by filtering waste and fluid from your blood.	general
That urine then travels through your ureters to your bladder, where the urine is stored until you can eliminate it at an appropriate time.	general
Pituitary gland and hypothalamus Pituitary gland and hypothalamus The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are located within the brain and control hormone production.	general
Diabetes insipidus occurs when your body can't properly balance the body's fluid levels.	general
When your fluid regulation system is working properly, your kidneys help maintain this balance.	general
The kidneys remove fluids from your bloodstream.	general
This fluid waste is temporarily stored in your bladder as urine, until you urinate.	general
The body can also rid itself of excess fluids through sweating, breathing or diarrhea.	general
A hormone called anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), or vasopressin, helps control how fast or slow fluids are excreted.	general
ADH is made in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland, a small gland found in the base of the brain.	general
If you have diabetes insipidus, your body can't properly balance fluid levels.	general
The cause varies depending on the type of diabetes insipidus you have: Damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus from surgery, a tumor, a head injury or an illness can cause central diabetes insipidus by affecting the usual production, storage and release of ADH.	general
An inherited genetic disease can also cause this condition.	general
Central diabetes insipidus.	general
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when there's a defect in the kidney tubules ‚Äî the structures in your kidneys that cause water to be excreted or reabsorbed.	general
This defect makes your kidneys unable to properly respond to ADH.	general
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.	general
The defect may be due to an inherited (genetic) disorder or a chronic kidney disorder.	general
Certain drugs, such as lithium or antiviral medications such as foscarnet (Foscavir), also can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.	general
Gestational diabetes insipidus is rare.	general
It occurs only during pregnancy when an enzyme made by the placenta destroys ADH in the mother.	general
Gestational diabetes insipidus.	general
Also known as dipsogenic diabetes insipidus, this condition can cause production of large amounts of diluted urine.	general
The underlying cause is drinking an excessive amount of fluids.	general
Primary polydipsia.	general
Primary polydipsia can be caused by damage to the thirst-regulating mechanism in the hypothalamus.	general
The condition has also been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia.	general
Sometimes, there's no obvious cause of diabetes insipidus.	general
However, in some people, the disorder may be the result of an autoimmune reaction that causes the immune system to damage the cells that make vasopressin.	general
Risk factors Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus that's present at or shortly after birth usually has an inherited (genetic) cause that permanently changes the kidneys' ability to concentrate the urine.	general
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus usually affects males, though women can pass the gene on to their children.	general
Complications Dehydration Electrolyte imbalance Diabetes insipidus can cause an imbalance in electrolytes ‚Äî minerals in your blood, such as sodium and potassium, that maintain the fluid balance in your body.	general
Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy (gestation).	general
Like other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes affects how your cells use sugar (glucose).	general
Gestational diabetes causes high blood sugar that can affect your pregnancy and your baby's health.	general
Any pregnancy complication is concerning, but there's good news.	general
Expectant women can help control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising and, if necessary, taking medication.	general
Controlling blood sugar can prevent a difficult birth and keep you and your baby healthy.	general
In gestational diabetes, blood sugar usually returns to normal soon after delivery.	general
But if you've had gestational diabetes, you're at risk for type 2 diabetes.	general
You'll continue working with your health care team to monitor and manage your blood sugar.	general
Products & Services For most women, gestational diabetes doesn't cause noticeable signs or symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor If possible, seek health care early ‚Äî when you first think about trying to get pregnant ‚Äî so your doctor can evaluate your risk of gestational diabetes as part of your overall childbearing wellness plan.	general
Once you're pregnant, your doctor will check you for gestational diabetes as part of your prenatal care.	general
If you develop gestational diabetes, you may need more-frequent checkups.	general
These are most likely to occur during the last three months of pregnancy, when your doctor will monitor your blood sugar level and your baby's health.	general
Your doctor may refer you to additional health professionals who specialize in diabetes, such as an endocrinologist, a registered dietitian or a diabetes educator.	general
They can help you learn to manage your blood sugar level during your pregnancy.	general
To make sure your blood sugar level has returned to normal after your baby is born, your health care team will check your blood sugar right after delivery and again in six weeks.	general
Once you've had gestational diabetes, it's a good idea to have your blood sugar level tested regularly.	general
The frequency of blood sugar tests will, in part, depend on your test results soon after you deliver your baby.	general
Researchers don't know why some women develop gestational diabetes.	general
To understand how gestational diabetes occurs, it can help to understand how pregnancy affects your body's glucose processing.	general
Your body digests the food you eat to produce sugar (glucose) that enters your bloodstream.	general
In response, your pancreas ‚Äî a large gland behind your stomach ‚Äî produces insulin.	general
Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose move from your bloodstream into your body's cells, where it's used as energy.	general
During pregnancy, the placenta, which connects your baby to your blood supply, produces high levels of various other hormones.	general
Almost all of them impair the action of insulin in your cells, raising your blood sugar.	general
Modest elevation of blood sugar after meals is normal during pregnancy.	general
As your baby grows, the placenta produces more and more insulin-counteracting hormones.	general
In gestational diabetes, the placental hormones provoke a rise in blood sugar to a level that can affect the growth and welfare of your baby.	general
Gestational diabetes usually develops during the last half of pregnancy ‚Äî sometimes as early as the 20th week, but generally not until later.	general
Risk factors Any woman can develop gestational diabetes, but some women are at greater risk.	general
Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Women older than age 25 are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.	general
Age greater than 25.	general
Your risk of developing gestational diabetes increases if you have prediabetes ‚Äî slightly elevated blood sugar that may be a precursor to type 2 diabetes ‚Äî or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes.	general
You're also more likely to develop gestational diabetes if you had it during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds (4.	general
1 kilograms) or if you had an unexplained stillbirth.	general
Family or personal health history.	general
You're more likely to develop gestational diabetes if you're significantly overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.	general
Excess weight.	general
For reasons that aren't clear, women who are black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian are at higher risk to develop gestational diabetes.	general
Nonwhite race.	general
Complications Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies.	general
However, gestational diabetes that's not carefully managed can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels and cause problems for you and your baby, including an increased likelihood of needing a C-section to deliver.	general
Complications that may affect your baby If you have gestational diabetes, your baby may be at increased risk of: Extra glucose in your bloodstream crosses the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin.	general
This can cause your baby to grow too large (macrosomia).	general
Very large babies ‚Äî those that weigh 9 pounds or more ‚Äî are more likely to become wedged in the birth canal, sustain birth injuries or require a C-section birth.	general
Excessive birth weight.	general
A mother's high blood sugar may increase her risk of early labor and delivering her baby before the baby's due date.	general
Or her doctor may recommend early delivery because the baby is large.	general
Early (preterm) birth and respiratory distress syndrome.	general
Babies born early may experience respiratory distress syndrome ‚Äî a condition that makes breathing difficult.	general
Babies with this syndrome may need help breathing until their lungs mature and become stronger.	general
Babies of mothers with gestational diabetes may experience respiratory distress syndrome even if they're not born early.	general
Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high.	general
Severe episodes of hypoglycemia may provoke seizures in the baby.	general
Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal.	general
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).	general
Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.	general
Type 2 diabetes later in life.	general
Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.	general
Complications that may affect you Gestational diabetes may also increase the mother's risk of: Gestational diabetes raises your risk of high blood pressure, as well as preeclampsia ‚Äî a serious complication of pregnancy that causes high blood pressure and other symptoms that can threaten the lives of both mother and baby.	general
High blood pressure and preeclampsia.	general
If you have gestational diabetes, you're more likely to get it again during a future pregnancy.	general
You're also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as you get older.	general
However, making healthy lifestyle choices such as eating healthy foods and exercising can help reduce the risk of future type 2 diabetes.	general
Future diabetes.	general
Of those women with a history of gestational diabetes who reach their ideal body weight after delivery, fewer than 1 in 4 eventually develop type 2 diabetes.	general
There are no guarantees when it comes to preventing gestational diabetes ‚Äî but the more healthy habits you can adopt before pregnancy, the better.	general
If you've had gestational diabetes, these healthy choices may also reduce your risk of having it in future pregnancies or developing type 2 diabetes down the road.	general
Choose foods high in fiber and low in fat and calories.	general
Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.	general
Strive for variety to help you achieve your goals without compromising taste or nutrition.	general
Watch portion sizes.	general
Eat healthy foods.	general
Exercising before and during pregnancy can help protect you from developing gestational diabetes.	general
Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days of the week.	general
Take a brisk daily walk.	general
Ride your bike.	general
Swim laps.	general
Keep active.	general
If you can't fit a single 30-minute workout into your day, several shorter sessions can do just as much good.	general
Park in the distant lot when you run errands.	general
Get off the bus one stop before you reach your destination.	general
Every step you take increases your chances of staying healthy.	general
Doctors don't recommend weight loss during pregnancy.	general
But if you're planning to get pregnant, losing extra weight beforehand may help you have a healthier pregnancy.	general
Lose excess pounds before pregnancy.	general
Focus on permanent changes to your eating habits.	general
Motivate yourself by remembering the long-term benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem.	general
Hypoglycemia is a condition caused by a very low level of blood sugar (glucose), your body's main energy source.	general
Hypoglycemia is often related to the treatment of diabetes.	general
However, a variety of conditions ‚Äî many rare ‚Äî can cause low blood sugar in people without diabetes.	general
Like fever, hypoglycemia isn't a disease itself ‚Äî it's an indicator of a health problem.	general
Immediate treatment of hypoglycemia is necessary when blood sugar levels are at 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 3.	general
9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or below.	general
Treatment involves quick steps to get your blood sugar level back into a normal range either with high-sugar foods or drinks or with medications.	general
Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the underlying cause of hypoglycemia.	general
If blood sugar levels become too low, signs and symptoms may include: An irregular heart rhythm Crying out during sleep As hypoglycemia worsens, signs and symptoms may include: Confusion, abnormal behavior or both, such as the inability to complete routine tasks Visual disturbances, such as blurred vision Loss of consciousness People with severe hypoglycemia may appear as if they're intoxicated.	general
They may slur their words and move clumsily.	general
When to see a doctor Seek a doctor's help immediately if: You have what may be symptoms of hypoglycemia and you don't have diabetes.	general
You have diabetes and hypoglycemia isn't responding to treatment.	general
Initial treatment of hypoglycemia is drinking juice or regular soft drinks, eating candy or taking glucose tablets.	general
If this treatment doesn't raise your blood sugar and improve your symptoms, contact your doctor right away.	general
Seek emergency help if: Someone with diabetes or a history of recurring hypoglycemia has symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or loses consciousness Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low.	general
There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes.	general
Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar.	general
When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods ‚Äî such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products ‚Äî into various sugar molecules, including glucose.	general
Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin ‚Äî a hormone secreted by your pancreas.	general
When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin.	general
This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly.	general
Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen.	general
If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream.	general
This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again.	general
Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose.	general
This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys.	general
Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes).	general
As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels.	general
To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels.	general
But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia.	general
Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would.	general
Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common.	general
Causes may include the following: Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia.	general
Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure.	general
One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria.	general
Medications.	general
Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia.	general
Excessive alcohol consumption.	general
Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia.	general
Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications.	general
Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia.	general
Some critical illnesses.	general
A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia.	general
Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances.	general
Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia.	general
Insulin overproduction.	general
Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production.	general
Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone.	general
Hormone deficiencies.	general
Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case.	general
Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed.	general
This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery.	general
It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery.	general
Complications If you ignore the symptoms of hypoglycemia too long, you may lose consciousness.	general
That's because your brain needs glucose to function properly.	general
Recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia early because untreated hypoglycemia can lead to: Hypoglycemia unawareness Over time, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can lead to hypoglycemia unawareness.	general
The body and brain no longer produce signs and symptoms that warn of a low blood sugar, such as shakiness or irregular heartbeats.	general
When this happens, the risk of severe, life-threatening hypoglycemia is increased.	general
Undertreated diabetes If you have diabetes, episodes of low blood sugar are uncomfortable and can be frightening.	general
Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia may cause you to take less insulin to ensure that your blood sugar level doesn't go too low.	general
But long-term high blood sugar levels can be dangerous too, possibly causing damage to your nerves, blood vessels and various organs.	general
Continuous glucose monitor Continuous glucose monitor A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is a device that measures your blood sugar every few minutes using a sensor inserted under the skin.	general
carefully follow the diabetes management plan you and your doctor have developed.	general
If you're taking new medications, changing your eating or medication schedules, or adding new exercise, talk to your doctor about how these changes might affect your diabetes management and your risk of low blood sugar.	general
If you have diabetes, A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is an option for some people, particularly those with hypoglycemia unawareness.	general
These devices insert a tiny wire under the skin that can send blood glucose readings to a receiver.	general
If blood sugar levels are dropping too low, some models of CGM will alert you with an alarm.	general
Some insulin pumps are now integrated with CGMs and can shut off insulin delivery when blood sugar levels are dropping too quickly to help prevent hypoglycemia.	general
Be sure to always have a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, such as juice or glucose tablets so that you can treat a falling blood sugar before it dips dangerously low.	general
but have recurring episodes of hypoglycemia, eating frequent small meals throughout the day is a stopgap measure to help prevent your blood sugar levels from getting too low.	general
However, this approach isn't an advisable long-term strategy.	general
Work with your doctor to identity and treat the underlying cause of hypoglycemia.	general
Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin.	general
Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.	general
Different factors, including genetics and some viruses, may contribute to type 1 diabetes.	general
Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults.	general
Despite active research, type 1 diabetes has no cure.	general
Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels with insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.	general
Products & Services Type 1 diabetes signs and symptoms can appear relatively suddenly and may include: Increased thirst Frequent urination Bed-wetting in children who previously didn't wet the bed during the night Extreme hunger Fatigue and weakness When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if you notice any of the above signs and symptoms in you or your child.	general
The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown.	general
Usually, the body's own immune system ‚Äî which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses ‚Äî mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing (islet, or islets of Langerhans) cells in the pancreas.	general
Other possible causes include: The role of insulin Once a significant number of islet cells are destroyed, you'll produce little or no insulin.	general
Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas).	general
The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.	general
Insulin circulates, allowing sugar to enter your cells.	general
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.	general
As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.	general
The role of glucose Glucose ‚Äî a sugar ‚Äî is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.	general
Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.	general
Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.	general
Your liver stores glucose as glycogen.	general
When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down the stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose levels within a normal range.	general
In type 1 diabetes, there's no insulin to let glucose into the cells, so sugar builds up in your bloodstream.	general
This can cause life-threatening complications.	general
Risk factors Some known risk factors for type 1 diabetes include: Anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition.	general
Family history.	general
The presence of certain genes indicates an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes.	general
The incidence of type 1 diabetes tends to increase as you travel away from the equator.	general
Although type 1 diabetes can appear at any age, it appears at two noticeable peaks.	general
The first peak occurs in children between 4 and 7 years old, and the second is in children between 10 and 14 years old.	general
Complications Over time, type 1 diabetes complications can affect major organs in your body, including heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys.	general
Maintaining a normal blood sugar level can dramatically reduce the risk of many complications.	general
Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening.	general
Diabetes dramatically increases your risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure.	general
Heart and blood vessel disease.	general
Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in the legs.	general
This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.	general
Poorly controlled blood sugar could cause you to eventually lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs.	general
Nerve damage (neuropathy).	general
Damage to the nerves that affect the gastrointestinal tract can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.	general
For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue.	general
The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood.	general
Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system.	general
Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant.	general
Kidney damage (nephropathy).	general
Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially causing blindness.	general
Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.	general
Eye damage.	general
Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications.	general
Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections that may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation.	general
Foot damage.	general
Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to infections of the skin and mouth, including bacterial and fungal infections.	general
Gum disease and dry mouth also are more likely.	general
Skin and mouth conditions.	general
High blood sugar levels can be dangerous for both the mother and the baby.	general
The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects increases when diabetes isn't well-controlled.	general
For the mother, diabetes increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic eye problems (retinopathy), pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and preeclampsia.	general
Pregnancy complications.	general
There's no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes.	general
But researchers are working on preventing the disease or further destruction of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed.	general
Ask your doctor if you might be eligible for one of these clinical trials, but carefully weigh the risks and benefits of any treatment available in a trial.	general

Type 1 diabetes in children is a condition in which your child's body no longer produces an important hormone (insulin).	general
Your child needs insulin to survive, so you'll have to replace the missing insulin.	general
Type 1 diabetes in children used to be known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes.	general
The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children can be overwhelming at first.	general
Suddenly you and your child ‚Äî depending on his or her age ‚Äî must learn how to give injections, count carbohydrates and monitor blood sugar.	general
Type 1 diabetes in children requires consistent care.	general
But advances in blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery have improved the daily management of the condition.	general
Products & Services The signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children usually develop quickly, over a period of weeks.	general
These signs and symptoms include: Excess sugar building up in your child's bloodstream pulls fluid from tissues.	general
As a result your child might be thirsty ‚Äî and drink and urinate more than usual.	general
A young, toilet-trained child might suddenly experience bed-wetting.	general
Increased thirst and frequent urination.	general
Without enough insulin to move sugar into your child's cells, your child's muscles and organs lack energy.	general
This triggers intense hunger.	general
Extreme hunger.	general
Despite eating more than usual to relieve hunger, your child may lose weight ‚Äî sometimes rapidly.	general
Without the energy sugar supplies, muscle tissues and fat stores simply shrink.	general
Unexplained weight loss is often the first sign of type 1 diabetes to be noticed in children.	general
Weight loss.	general
Lack of sugar in your child's cells might make him or her tired and lethargic.	general
In addition to mood problems, your child might suddenly have a decline in performance at school.	general
Irritability or behavior changes.	general
Burning fat instead of sugar produces certain substances (ketones) that can cause a fruity breath odor.	general
Fruity-smelling breath.	general
If your child's blood sugar is too high, fluid may be pulled from the lenses of your child's eyes.	general
Your child might be unable to focus clearly.	general
Blurred vision.	general
Girls with type 1 diabetes may have a genital yeast infections.	general
Babies can develop diaper rashes caused by yeast.	general
Yeast infection.	general
When to see a doctor See your child's doctor if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of type 1 diabetes.	general
The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown.	general
But in most people with type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system ‚Äî which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses ‚Äî mistakenly destroys insulin-producing (islet) cells in the pancreas.	general
Genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role in this process.	general
Insulin performs the critical job of moving sugar (glucose) from the bloodstream to the body's cells.	general
Sugar enters the bloodstream when food is digested.	general
Once the islet cells of the pancreas are destroyed, your child produces little or no insulin.	general
As a result, glucose builds up in your child's bloodstream, where it can cause life-threatening complications.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for type 1 diabetes in children include: Anyone with a parent or siblings with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition.	general
Family history.	general
The presence of certain genes indicates an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes.	general
Genetic susceptibility.	general
In the United States, type 1 diabetes is more common among non-Hispanic white children than among other races.	general
Environmental risk factors might include: Exposure to various viruses may trigger the autoimmune destruction of the islet cells.	general
Certain viruses.	general
No specific dietary factor or nutrient in infancy has been shown to play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes.	general
However, early intake of cow's milk has been linked to an increased risk of type 1 diabetes, while breast-feeding might lower the risk.	general
The timing of the introduction of cereal into a baby's diet also may affect a child's risk of type 1 diabetes.	general
Complications Complications of type 1 diabetes develop gradually.	general
If blood sugar levels aren't well-controlled over a prolonged period of time, diabetes complications can eventually be disabling or even life-threatening.	general
Complications can include: Diabetes dramatically increases your child's risk of developing conditions such as coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure later in life.	general
Heart and blood vessel disease.	general
Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your child's nerves, especially in the legs.	general
This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain.	general
Nerve damage usually happens gradually over a long period of time.	general
Nerve damage.	general
Diabetes can damage the numerous tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your child's blood.	general
Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant.	general
Kidney damage.	general
Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, which may lead to poor vision and even possibly causing blindness.	general
Diabetes can also lead to cataracts and a greater risk of glaucoma.	general
Eye damage.	general
Diabetes may leave your child more prone to skin problems, including bacterial infections, fungal infections and itching.	general
Skin conditions.	general
Diabetes may lead to lower than normal bone mineral density, increasing your child's risk of osteoporosis as an adult.	general
Osteoporosis.	general
There's currently no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes.	general
Children who have a high risk of developing type 1 diabetes can be tested for antibodies associated with the disorder.	general
But the presence of these antibodies doesn't make diabetes inevitable.	general
And there's currently no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes if the antibodies are found.	general
Researchers are working on preventing type 1 diabetes in people who have a high risk of developing the disease.	general
Other research focuses on preventing further destruction of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed.	general
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose) ‚Äî an important source of fuel for your body.	general
With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin ‚Äî a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells ‚Äî or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.	general
Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but today more children are being diagnosed with the disorder, probably due to the rise in childhood obesity.	general
There's no cure for type 2 diabetes, but losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease.	general
If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage your blood sugar well, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy.	general
Products & Services Signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly.	general
In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it.	general
Look for: Increased thirst Frequent urination Increased hunger Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck When to see a doctor See your doctor if you notice type 2 diabetes symptoms.	general
Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin.	general
Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as being overweight and inactive, seem to be contributing factors.	general
How insulin works Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas).	general
The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.	general
The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.	general
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.	general
As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.	general
The role of glucose Glucose ‚Äî a sugar ‚Äî is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.	general
Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.	general
Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.	general
Your liver stores and makes glucose.	general
When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range.	general
In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well.	general
Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.	general
As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's demands.	general
In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes include: Being overweight is a main risk factor for type 2 diabetes.	general
However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes.	general
If you store fat mainly in the abdomen, you have a greater risk of type 2 diabetes than if you store fat elsewhere, such as in your hips and thighs.	general
Your risk of type 2 diabetes rises if you're a man with a waist circumference above 40 inches (101.	general
6 centimeters) or a woman with a waist that's greater than 35 inches (88.	general
9 centimeters).	general
Fat distribution.	general
The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes.	general
Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.	general
Inactivity.	general
The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.	general
Family history.	general
Although it's unclear why, people of certain races ‚Äî including black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian-American people ‚Äî are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white people are.	general
The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45.	general
That's probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age.	general
But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults.	general
Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes.	general
Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes.	general
Prediabetes.	general
If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases.	general
If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes.	general
Gestational diabetes.	general
For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome ‚Äî a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity ‚Äî increases the risk of diabetes Polycystic ovarian syndrome.	general
This condition often indicates insulin resistance.	general
Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck.	general
Complications Type 2 diabetes can be easy to ignore, especially in the early stages when you're feeling fine.	general
But diabetes affects many major organs, including your heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys.	general
Controlling your blood sugar levels can help prevent these complications.	general
Although long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually, they can eventually be disabling or even life-threatening.	general
Some of the potential complications of diabetes include: Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and narrowing of blood vessels (atherosclerosis).	general
Heart and blood vessel disease.	general
Excess sugar can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.	general
Eventually, you may lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs.	general
Nerve damage (neuropathy).	general
Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.	general
For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue.	general
Diabetes can sometimes lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.	general
Kidney damage.	general
Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye diseases, such as cataracts and glaucoma, and may damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness.	general
Eye damage.	general
Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections, which may heal poorly.	general
Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation.	general
Slow healing.	general
Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.	general
Hearing impairment.	general
Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.	general
Skin conditions.	general
Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people with type 2 diabetes.	general
Obesity may be the main contributing factor to both conditions.	general
Treating sleep apnea may lower your blood pressure and make you feel more rested, but it's not clear whether it helps improve blood sugar control.	general
Sleep apnea.	general
Type 2 diabetes seems to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, though it's not clear why.	general
The worse your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be.	general
Alzheimer's disease.	general
Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes, and that's true even if you have diabetes in your family.	general
If you've already received a diagnosis of diabetes, you can use healthy lifestyle choices to help prevent complications.	general
If you have prediabetes, lifestyle changes can slow or stop the progression to diabetes.	general
A healthy lifestyle includes: Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber.	general
Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.	general
Eating healthy foods.	general
Aim for a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of moderate physical activity ‚Äî or 15 to 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity ‚Äî on most days.	general
Take a brisk daily walk.	general
Ride a bike.	general
Swim laps.	general
If you can't fit in a long workout, spread your activity throughout the day.	general
Getting active.	general
If you're overweight, losing 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can reduce the risk of diabetes.	general
To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits.	general
Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem.	general
Losing weight.	general
Sitting still for long periods can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes.	general
Try to get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes.	general
Avoiding being sedentary for long periods.	general
Sometimes medication is an option as well.	general
Metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others), an oral diabetes medication, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.	general
But even if you take medication, healthy lifestyle choices remain essential for preventing or managing diabetes.	general

Type 2 diabetes in children is a chronic disease that affects the way your child's body processes sugar (glucose).	general
It's important to manage your child's diabetes because its long-term consequences can be disabling or even life-threatening.	general
Type 2 diabetes is more commonly associated with adults.	general
In fact, it used to be called adult-onset diabetes.	general
But type 2 diabetes in children is on the rise, fueled largely by the obesity epidemic.	general
There's plenty you can do to help manage or prevent type 2 diabetes in children.	general
Encourage your child to eat healthy foods, get plenty of physical activity and maintain a healthy weight.	general
If diet and exercise aren't enough to control type 2 diabetes in children, oral medication or insulin treatment may be needed.	general
Products & Services Type 2 diabetes in children may develop gradually.	general
About 40 percent of children who have type 2 diabetes have no signs or symptoms and are diagnosed during routine physical exams.	general
Other children might experience: Excess sugar building up in your child's bloodstream pulls fluid from tissues.	general
As a result your child might be thirsty ‚Äî and drink and urinate more than usual.	general
Increased thirst and frequent urination.	general
Without the energy that sugar supplies, muscle tissues and fat stores simply shrink.	general
However, weight loss is less common in children with type 2 diabetes than in children with type 1 diabetes.	general
Weight loss.	general
Lack of sugar in your child's cells might make him or her tired and lethargic.	general
If your child's blood sugar is too high, fluid may be pulled from the lenses of your child's eyes.	general
Your child might be unable to focus clearly.	general
Blurred vision.	general
Type 2 diabetes affects your child's ability to heal and resist infections.	general
Slow-healing sores or frequent infections.	general
When to see a doctor See your child's doctor if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of type 2 diabetes.	general
Undiagnosed, the disease can cause serious damage.	general
Diabetes screening is recommended for all children and adolescents who are overweight and have at least two other risk factors for type 2 diabetes.	general
The exact cause of type 2 diabetes is unknown.	general
But family history and genetics appear to play an important role.	general
Inactivity and excess fat ‚Äî especially abdominal fat ‚Äî also seem to be important factors.	general
What is clear is that people with type 2 diabetes don't process glucose properly anymore.	general
As a result, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream instead of doing its normal job of fueling the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.	general
Most of the glucose in people's bodies comes from the food they eat.	general
When food is digested, sugar enters the bloodstream.	general
Moving sugar from the bloodstream to the body's cells requires a hormone (insulin).	general
Insulin comes from the pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach.	general
The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream after a person eats.	general
As insulin circulates, it allows sugar to enter the cells ‚Äî and lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.	general
As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.	general
Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas stops making enough insulin.	general
The resulting buildup of sugar in the bloodstream can cause life-threatening complications.	general
Risk factors Researchers don't fully understand why some children develop type 2 diabetes and others don't, even if they have similar risk factors.	general
However, it's clear that certain factors increase the risk, including: Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes.	general
The more fatty tissue children have ‚Äî especially inside and between the muscle and skin around the abdomen ‚Äî the more resistant their bodies' cells become to insulin.	general
The association between obesity and type 2 diabetes is even stronger in youth than in adults.	general
The less active your child is, the greater his or her risk of type 2 diabetes.	general
Physical activity helps your child control his or her weight, uses glucose as energy, and makes your child's cells more responsive to insulin.	general
Inactivity.	general
Children's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if they have a parent or sibling with the disease.	general
Family history.	general
Although it's unclear why, people of certain races ‚Äî including African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders ‚Äî are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.	general
Many children develop type 2 diabetes at the start of puberty.	general
Adolescent girls are likelier to develop type 2 diabetes than are adolescent boys.	general
Age and sex.	general
Low birth weight and being born to a mother who had gestational diabetes during the pregnancy are both associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.	general
Birth weight and gestational diabetes.	general
Complications Type 2 diabetes can affect nearly every major organ in your child's body, including the blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys.	general
The long-term complications of type 2 diabetes develop gradually.	general
But eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening.	general
Complications of type 2 diabetes include: High blood pressure Certain skin conditions Keeping your child's blood sugar level close to normal most of the time can dramatically reduce the risk of these complications.	general
Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children and its complications.	general
And if your child already has type 2 diabetes, lifestyle changes can reduce the need for medications.	general
Encourage your child to: Offer your child foods low in fat and calories.	general
Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.	general
Strive for variety to prevent boredom.	general
Eat healthy foods.	general
Encourage your child to become active.	general
Sign up for a sports team or dance lessons, or look for active things to do together.	general
Get more physical activity.	general
Better yet, make it a family affair.	general
The same lifestyle choices that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children can do the same for adults.	general
The best diet for a child with diabetes is also the best diet for the whole family.	general
A diabetic coma is a life-threatening diabetes complication that causes unconsciousness.	general
If you have diabetes, dangerously high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) or dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can lead to a diabetic coma.	general
If you lapse into a diabetic coma, you're alive ‚Äî but you can't awaken or respond purposefully to sights, sounds or other types of stimulation.	general
Left untreated, a diabetic coma can be fatal.	general
The idea of a diabetic coma is scary, but you can take steps to help prevent it.	general
Start by following your diabetes treatment plan.	general
Products & Services Before developing a diabetic coma, you'll usually experience signs and symptoms of high blood sugar or low blood sugar.	general
High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) If your blood sugar level is too high, you may experience: Increased thirst Frequent urination Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Signs and symptoms of a low blood sugar level may include: Shakiness or nervousness Some people, especially those who've had diabetes for a long time, develop a condition known as hypoglycemia unawareness and won't have the warning signs that signal a drop in blood sugar.	general
If you experience any symptoms of high or low blood sugar, test your blood sugar and follow your diabetes treatment plan based on the test results.	general
If you don't start to feel better quickly, or you start to feel worse, call for emergency help.	general
When to see a doctor A diabetic coma is a medical emergency.	general
If you feel extreme high or low blood sugar signs or symptoms and think you might pass out, call 911 or your local emergency number.	general
If you're with someone with diabetes who has passed out, call for emergency help, and be sure to let the emergency personnel know that the unconscious person has diabetes.	general
Blood sugar that's either too high or too low for too long may cause various serious conditions, all of which can lead to a diabetic coma.	general
If your muscle cells become starved for energy, your body may respond by breaking down fat stores.	general
This process forms toxic acids known as ketones.	general
If you have ketones (measured in blood or urine) and high blood sugar, the condition is called diabetic ketoacidosis.	general
Left untreated, it can lead to a diabetic coma.	general
Diabetic ketoacidosis.	general
Diabetic ketoacidosis is most common in type 1 diabetes but sometimes occurs in type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes.	general
If your blood sugar level tops 600 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 33.	general
3 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), the condition is called diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.	general
Diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.	general
Severely high blood sugar turns your blood thick and syrupy.	general
The excess sugar passes from your blood into your urine, which triggers a filtering process that draws tremendous amounts of fluid from your body.	general
Left untreated, this can lead to life-threatening dehydration and a diabetic coma.	general
About 25 to 50 percent of people with diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome develop a coma.	general
Your brain needs glucose to function.	general
In severe cases, low blood sugar may cause you to pass out.	general
Hypoglycemia can be caused by too much insulin or not enough food.	general
Exercising too vigorously or drinking too much alcohol can have the same effect.	general
Hypoglycemia.	general
Risk factors Anyone who has diabetes is at risk of a diabetic coma, but the following factors can increase the risk: If you're on an insulin pump, you have to check your blood sugar frequently.	general
Insulin delivery can stop if the pump fails or the tubing (catheter) is twisted or falls out of place.	general
A lack of insulin can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.	general
Insulin delivery problems.	general
When you're sick or injured, blood sugar levels tend to rise, sometimes dramatically.	general
This may cause diabetic ketoacidosis if you have type 1 diabetes and don't increase your insulin dosage to compensate.	general
An illness, trauma or surgery.	general
Medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure or kidney disease, also may increase your risk of diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.	general
If you don't monitor your blood sugar properly or take your medications as directed, you'll have a higher risk of developing long-term complications and a diabetic coma.	general
Poorly managed diabetes.	general
Sometimes, people with diabetes who also have an eating disorder choose not to use their insulin as directed with the hope of losing weight.	general
This is a dangerous, life-threatening practice that increases the risk of a diabetic coma.	general
Deliberately skipping meals or insulin.	general
Alcohol can have unpredictable effects on your blood sugar.	general
Alcohol's sedating effects may make it harder for you to know when you're having low blood sugar symptoms.	general
This can increase your risk of a diabetic coma caused by hypoglycemia.	general
Drinking alcohol.	general
Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and ecstasy, can increase your risk of severe high blood sugar levels and conditions linked to diabetic coma.	general
Illegal drug use.	general
Complications Permanent brain damage Good day-to-day control of your diabetes can help you prevent a diabetic coma.	general
Keep these tips in mind: Consistent snacks and meals can help you control your blood sugar level.	general
Follow your meal plan.	general
Frequent blood sugar tests can tell you whether you're keeping your blood sugar level in your target range ‚Äî and alert you to dangerous highs or lows.	general
Check more frequently if you've exercised because exercise can cause blood sugar levels to drop, even hours later, especially if you don't exercise regularly.	general
Keep an eye on your blood sugar level.	general
If you have frequent episodes of high or low blood sugar, let your doctor know.	general
He or she may need to adjust the dose or the timing of your medication.	general
Take your medication as directed.	general
Illness can cause an unexpected change in blood sugar.	general
If you are sick and unable to eat, your blood sugar may drop.	general
Before you get sick, talk with your doctor about how to best manage your blood sugar levels.	general
Consider storing at least three days' worth of diabetes supplies and an extra glucagon kit in case of emergencies.	general
Have a sick-day plan.	general
Check your urine for ketones when your blood sugar level is over 250 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) on more than two consecutive tests, especially if you are sick.	general
If you have a large amount of ketones, call your doctor for advice.	general
Call your doctor immediately if you have any level of ketones and are vomiting.	general
High levels of ketones can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can lead to coma.	general
Check for ketones when your blood sugar is high.	general
If you take insulin for your diabetes, make sure you have an up-to-date glucagon kit and fast-acting sources of sugar, such as glucose tablets or orange juice, readily available to treat low blood sugar levels.	general
Have glucagon and fast-acting sources of sugar available.	general
especially if you have trouble maintaining stable blood sugar levels or you don't feel symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia unawareness).	general
Consider a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), CGMs are devices that use a small sensor inserted underneath the skin to track trends in your blood sugar levels and transmit the information to a wireless device.	general
These devices can alert you when your blood sugar is dangerously low or if it is dropping too fast.	general
However, you still need to test your blood sugar levels using a blood glucose meter even if you're using a CGM.	general
CGMs are more expensive than conventional glucose monitoring methods, but they may help you control your glucose better.	general
Because alcohol can have an unpredictable effect on your blood sugar, be sure to have a snack or a meal when you drink, if you choose to drink at all.	general
Drink alcohol with caution.	general
Teach loved ones and other close contacts how to recognize the early signs and symptoms of blood sugar extremes and how to give emergency injections.	general
If you pass out, someone should be able to call for emergency help.	general
Educate your loved ones, friends and co-workers.	general
If you're unconscious, the ID can provide valuable information to your friends, co-workers and others ‚Äî including emergency personnel.	general
Wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace.	general
Diabetic hyperosmolar (hi-pur-oz-MOE-lur) syndrome is a serious condition caused by extremely high blood sugar levels.	general
The condition most commonly occurs in people with type 2 diabetes.	general
It's often triggered by illness or infection.	general
As a result of diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome, your body tries to rid itself of the excess blood sugar by passing it into your urine.	general
Left untreated, diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome can lead to life-threatening dehydration.	general
Prompt medical care is essential.	general
Products & Services Diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome can take days or weeks to develop.	general
Possible signs and symptoms include: Blood sugar level of 600 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 33.	general
3 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or higher Excessive thirst Increased urination When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if your blood sugar is persistently higher than the target range your doctor recommends, or if you have signs or symptoms of diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome, such as: Excessive thirst Increased urination Seek emergency care if: Your blood sugar level is 400 mg/dL (22.	general
2 mmol/L) or higher and doesn't improve despite following your doctor's instructions for treatment.	general
Don't wait until your blood sugar is high enough to cause diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.	general
You have confusion, vision changes or other signs of dehydration.	general
Illness or infection Not following a diabetes treatment plan or having an inadequate treatment plan Certain medications, such as water pills (diuretics) Sometimes undiagnosed diabetes results in diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.	general
Risk factors Your risk of developing diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome might be higher if you: If you don't monitor your blood sugar or you don't yet know you have type 2 diabetes, your risk is higher.	general
Have type 2 diabetes.	general
Are older than age 65.	general
such as congestive heart failure or kidney disease.	general
Have another chronic health condition, such as pneumonia, a urinary tract infection or a virus, which causes your blood sugar levels to rise.	general
Have an infection, Some drugs ‚Äî such as corticosteroids (prednisone), diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone) and the anti-seizure medication phenytoin (Dilantin).	general
Take certain medications.	general
Complications Good daily control of your diabetes can help you prevent diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome.	general
Be alert for the warning symptoms of high blood sugar, as well as the situations that put you at risk of developing hyperosmolar syndrome, such as illness or infections.	general
Know the symptoms of high blood sugar.	general
Monitoring will help you stay in your target range and alert you to dangerous highs.	general
Ask your doctor how often you should test your blood sugar.	general
Monitor more often when you're sick.	general
Monitor your blood sugar level.	general
Drink a glass of nonalcoholic, caffeine-free beverage hourly until you can ask your doctor for advice.	general
When you're sick, drink plenty of liquids.	general
Eat nutritious meals, take medications as directed and exercise regularly.	general
Follow your diabetes management plan.	general
Teach people you spend time with to recognize early signs and symptoms of blood sugar extremes ‚Äî and to summon emergency help if you pass out.	general
Educate your loved ones, friends and co-workers.	general
If you're unconscious, the ID can provide valuable information to others, including emergency personnel.	general
Wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace.	general
Get an annual flu shot and ask your doctor if you need the pneumococcal vaccine, which protects against some forms of pneumonia.	general
Stay current on vaccinations.	general
For people with diabetes, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) occurs when there's too much insulin and not enough sugar (glucose) in the blood.	general
Hypoglycemia is defined as blood sugar below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.	general
9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).	general
Several factors can cause hypoglycemia in people with diabetes, including taking too much insulin or other diabetes medications, skipping a meal, or exercising harder than usual.	general
Pay attention to early warning signs, so you can treat low blood sugar promptly.	general
Treatment involves short-term solutions ‚Äî such as taking glucose tablets or drinking fruit juice ‚Äî to raise your blood sugar into a normal range.	general
Untreated, diabetic hypoglycemia can lead to seizures and loss of consciousness ‚Äî a medical emergency.	general
Rarely, it can be deadly.	general
Tell family and friends what symptoms to look for and what to do in case you're not able to treat the condition yourself.	general
Products & Services Early signs and symptoms of diabetic hypoglycemia include: Nighttime symptoms Diabetic hypoglycemia can also occur while you sleep.	general
Signs and symptoms, which can awaken you, include: Damp sheets or bedclothes due to perspiration Severe symptoms If diabetic hypoglycemia goes untreated, signs and symptoms of severe hypoglycemia can occur.	general
These include: Clumsiness or jerky movements Blurry or double vision Take your symptoms seriously.	general
Diabetic hypoglycemia can increase the risk of serious ‚Äî even deadly ‚Äî accidents.	general
Identifying and correcting the factors contributing to hypoglycemia, such as medications you take or irregular mealtimes, can prevent serious complications.	general
Informing people you trust, such as family, friends and co-workers, about hypoglycemia is important.	general
Their knowing what symptoms to look for and what to do in case you're not able to help yourself can make a potentially difficult situation easier to manage.	general
It's also important that they know how to give you a glucagon injection, in case it becomes necessary.	general
Symptoms can differ from person to person or from time to time, so it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly and keep track of how you're feeling when your blood sugar is low.	general
Some people don't have or don't recognize early symptoms (hypoglycemia unawareness).	general
If you have hypoglycemia unawareness, you may require a higher glucose goal range.	general
When to see a doctor Hypoglycemia can leave you confused or even unconscious, which requires emergency care.	general
Make sure your family, friends and co-workers know what to do.	general
If you lose consciousness or can't swallow: You shouldn't be given fluids or food, which could cause choking You need an injection of glucagon ‚Äî a hormone that stimulates the release of sugar into the blood You need emergency treatment in a hospital if a glucagon injection isn't on hand If you have symptoms of hypoglycemia several times a week, see your doctor.	general
You may need to change your medication or your dosage or otherwise adjust your diabetes treatment program.	general
Hypoglycemia is most common among people who take insulin, but it can also occur if you're taking certain oral diabetes medications.	general
Common causes of diabetic hypoglycemia include: Taking too much insulin or diabetes medication Not eating enough Postponing or skipping a meal or snack Increasing exercise or physical activity without eating more or adjusting your medications Drinking alcohol Blood sugar regulation The hormone insulin lowers glucose levels when glucose is elevated.	general
If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and need insulin to control your blood sugar, taking more insulin than you need can cause your blood sugar level to drop too low and result in hypoglycemia.	general
Hypoglycemia also may result if, after taking your diabetes medication, you eat less than usual or exercise more than you normally do.	general
Your doctor can work with you to prevent this imbalance by finding the dose that fits your regular eating and activity patterns.	general
Complications If you ignore the symptoms of hypoglycemia too long, you may lose consciousness.	general
That's because your brain needs glucose to function.	general
Recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia early because if untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to: On the other hand, be careful not to overtreat your low blood sugar.	general
If you do, you may cause your blood sugar level to rise too high (hyperglycemia), which can become a problem with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia.	general
To help prevent diabetic hypoglycemia: If you take insulin or oral diabetes medication, be consistent about the amount you eat and the timing of your meals and snacks.	general
Don't skip or delay meals or snacks.	general
Depending on your treatment plan, you may check and record your blood sugar level several times a week or several times a day.	general
Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range.	general
Monitor your blood sugar.	general
Take your medication as recommended by your doctor.	general
Measure medication carefully, and take it on time.	general
The adjustment depends on the blood sugar test results and on the type and length of the activity.	general
Adjust your medication or eat additional snacks if you increase your physical activity.	general
Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can cause hypoglycemia.	general
Eat a meal or snack with alcohol, if you choose to drink.	general
This can help you and your health care team identify patterns contributing to hypoglycemia and find ways to prevent them.	general
Record your low glucose reactions.	general
Use a medical identification necklace or bracelet and wallet card.	general
Carry some form of diabetes identification so that in an emergency others will know that you have diabetes.	general
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when your body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones.	general
The condition develops when your body can't produce enough insulin.	general
Insulin normally plays a key role in helping sugar (glucose) ‚Äî a major source of energy for your muscles and other tissues ‚Äî enter your cells.	general
Without enough insulin, your body begins to break down fat as fuel.	general
This process produces a buildup of acids in the bloodstream called ketones, eventually leading to diabetic ketoacidosis if untreated.	general
If you have diabetes or you're at risk of diabetes, learn the warning signs of diabetic ketoacidosis ‚Äî and know when to seek emergency care.	general
Diabetic ketoacidosis signs and symptoms often develop quickly, sometimes within 24 hours.	general
For some, these signs and symptoms may be the first indication of having diabetes.	general
You may notice: Excessive thirst Frequent urination More-specific signs of diabetic ketoacidosis ‚Äî which can be detected through home blood and urine testing kits ‚Äî include: High blood sugar level (hyperglycemia) High ketone levels in your urine When to see a doctor If you feel ill or stressed or you've had a recent illness or injury, check your blood sugar level often.	general
You might also try an over-the-counter urine ketones testing kit.	general
Contact your doctor immediately if: You're vomiting and unable to tolerate food or liquid Your blood sugar level is higher than your target range and doesn't respond to home treatment Your urine ketone level is moderate or high Seek emergency care if: Your blood sugar level is consistently higher than 300 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 16.	general
7 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) You have ketones in your urine and can't reach your doctor for advice You have multiple signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis ‚Äî excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, fruity-scented breath, confusion Remember, untreated diabetic ketoacidosis can be fatal.	general
Sugar is a main source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and other tissues.	general
Normally, insulin helps sugar enter your cells.	general
Without enough insulin, your body can't use sugar properly for energy.	general
This prompts the release of hormones that break down fat as fuel, which produces acids known as ketones.	general
"Excess ketones build up in the blood and eventually ""spill over"" into the urine."	general
Diabetic ketoacidosis is usually triggered by: An infection or other illness can cause your body to produce higher levels of certain hormones, such as adrenaline or cortisol.	general
Unfortunately, these hormones counter the effect of insulin ‚Äî sometimes triggering an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis.	general
Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common culprits.	general
An illness.	general
Missed insulin treatments or inadequate insulin therapy can leave you with too little insulin in your system, triggering diabetic ketoacidosis.	general
A problem with insulin therapy.	general
Other possible triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis include: Physical or emotional trauma Certain medications, such as corticosteroids and some diuretics Risk factors Have type 1 diabetes Frequently miss insulin doses Uncommonly, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur if you have type 2 diabetes.	general
In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis may be the first sign that a person has diabetes.	general
Complications Diabetic ketoacidosis is treated with fluids, electrolytes ‚Äî such as sodium, potassium and chloride ‚Äî and insulin.	general
Perhaps surprisingly, the most common complications of diabetic ketoacidosis are related to this lifesaving treatment.	general
Possible complications of the treatments Treatment complications include: Insulin allows sugar to enter your cells, causing your blood sugar level to drop.	general
If your blood sugar level drops too quickly, you can develop low blood sugar.	general
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).	general
The fluids and insulin used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis can cause your potassium level to drop too low.	general
A low potassium level can impair the activities of your heart, muscles and nerves.	general
Low potassium (hypokalemia).	general
Adjusting your blood sugar level too quickly can produce swelling in your brain.	general
This complication appears to be more common in children, especially those with newly diagnosed diabetes.	general
Swelling in the brain (cerebral edema).	general
Left untreated, the risks are much greater.	general
Diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to loss of consciousness and, eventually, it can be fatal.	general
There's much you can do to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis and other diabetes complications.	general
Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine.	general
Take oral diabetes medications or insulin as directed.	general
Commit to managing your diabetes.	general
You might need to check and record your blood sugar level at least three to four times a day ‚Äî more often if you're ill or under stress.	general
Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure your blood sugar level remains within your target range.	general
Monitor your blood sugar level.	general
Talk to your doctor or diabetes educator about how to adjust your insulin dosage in relation to your blood sugar level, what you eat, how active you are, whether you're ill and other factors.	general
If your blood sugar level begins to rise, follow your diabetes treatment plan to return your blood sugar level to your target range.	general
Adjust your insulin dosage as needed.	general
When you're ill or under stress, test your urine for excess ketones with an over-the-counter urine ketones test kit.	general
If your ketone level is moderate or high, contact your doctor right away or seek emergency care.	general
If you find anything higher than trace levels of ketones you may need to take more insulin.	general
Check your ketone level.	general
If you suspect that you have diabetic ketoacidosis ‚Äî your blood sugar level is high, and you have excess ketones in your urine ‚Äî seek emergency care.	general
Be prepared to act quickly.	general
Diabetes complications are scary.	general
But don't let fear keep you from taking good care of yourself.	general
Follow your diabetes treatment plan carefully, and ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.	general
Diabetic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that can occur if you have diabetes.	general
High blood sugar (glucose) can injure nerves throughout your body.	general
Diabetic neuropathy most often damages nerves in your legs and feet.	general
Depending on the affected nerves, symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can range from pain and numbness in your legs and feet to problems with your digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels and heart.	general
Some people have mild symptoms.	general
But for others, diabetic neuropathy can be quite painful and disabling.	general
Diabetic neuropathy is a common and serious complication of diabetes.	general
But you can often prevent diabetic neuropathy or slow its progress with tight blood sugar control and a healthy lifestyle.	general
Products & Services There are four main types of diabetic neuropathy.	general
You can have one or more than one type of neuropathy.	general
Your symptoms will depend on the type you have and which nerves are affected.	general
Usually, symptoms develop gradually.	general
You may not notice anything wrong until considerable nerve damage has occurred.	general
Peripheral neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy is the most common type of diabetic neuropathy.	general
It affects the feet and legs first, followed by the hands and arms.	general
Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are often worse at night, and may include: Numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes Tingling or burning sensation Sharp pains or cramps Increased sensitivity to touch ‚Äî for some people, even the weight of a bedsheet can be painful Muscle weakness Loss of balance and coordination Serious foot problems, such as ulcers, infections, and bone and joint pain Autonomic neuropathy The autonomic nervous system controls your heart, bladder, stomach, intestines, sex organs and eyes.	general
Diabetes can affect nerves in any of these areas, possibly causing: A lack of awareness that blood sugar levels are low (hypoglycemia unawareness) Bladder problems, including urinary tract infections or urinary retention or incontinence Constipation, uncontrolled diarrhea or both Slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis), causing nausea, vomiting, bloating and loss of appetite Difficulty swallowing Increased or decreased sweating Problems controlling body temperature Changes in the way your eyes adjust from light to dark Increased heart rate at rest Sharp drops in blood pressure after sitting or standing that may cause you to faint or feel lightheaded Erectile dysfunction Vaginal dryness Radiculoplexus neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy) Radiculoplexus neuropathy affects nerves in the thighs, hips, buttocks or legs.	general
It's more common in people with type 2 diabetes and older adults.	general
Other names for this type are diabetic amyotrophy, femoral neuropathy or proximal neuropathy.	general
Symptoms are usually on one side of the body, but sometimes may spread to the other side.	general
You may have: Severe pain in a hip and thigh or buttock that occurs in a day or more Eventual weak and shrinking thigh muscles Difficulty rising from a sitting position Abdominal swelling, if the abdomen is affected Weight loss Most people improve at least partially over time, though symptoms may worsen before they get better.	general
Mononeuropathy Mononeuropathy, or focal neuropathy, is damage to a specific nerve in the face, middle of the body (torso) or leg.	general
It's most common in older adults.	general
Mononeuropathy often strikes suddenly and can cause severe pain.	general
However, it usually doesn't cause any long-term problems.	general
Symptoms usually go away without treatment over a few weeks or months.	general
Your specific signs and symptoms depend on which nerve is involved.	general
You may have pain in the: Shin or foot Front of thigh Chest or abdomen Mononeuropathy may also cause nerve problems in the eyes and face, leading to: Difficulty focusing Double vision Paralysis on one side of your face (Bell's palsy) Sometimes mononeuropathy occurs when something is pressing on a nerve (nerve compression).	general
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common type of compression neuropathy in people with diabetes.	general
It can cause numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers, except your pinkie (little finger).	general
Your hand may feel weak, and you may drop things.	general
When to see a doctor Call your doctor for an appointment if you have: A cut or sore on your foot that is infected or won't heal Burning, tingling, weakness or pain in your hands or feet that interferes with daily activities or sleep Changes in digestion, urination or sexual function These signs and symptoms don't always mean you have nerve damage.	general
But they can be a sign of another condition that requires medical care.	general
Early diagnosis and treatment of any health condition gives you the best chance for controlling your diabetes and preventing future problems.	general
More Information Damage to nerves and blood vessels The exact cause likely differs for each type of neuropathy.	general
Researchers think that over time, uncontrolled high blood sugar damages nerves and interferes with their ability to send signals, leading to diabetic neuropathy.	general
High blood sugar also weakens the walls of the small blood vessels (capillaries) that supply the nerves with oxygen and nutrients.	general
However, a combination of factors may lead to nerve damage, including: caused by an autoimmune response.	general
The immune system mistakes nerves as foreign and attacks them.	general
Inflammation in the nerves unrelated to diabetes may make some people more likely to develop nerve damage.	general
Genetic factors damage both nerves and blood vessels and significantly increase the risk of infection.	general
Smoking and alcohol abuse Risk factors Anyone who has diabetes can develop neuropathy, but these risk factors make you more likely to get nerve damage: Uncontrolled blood sugar puts you at risk of every diabetes complication, including nerve damage.	general
Poor blood sugar control.	general
Your risk of diabetic neuropathy increases the longer you have diabetes, especially if your blood sugar isn't well-controlled.	general
Diabetes history.	general
Diabetes can damage the kidneys.	general
Kidney damage sends toxins into the blood, which can lead to nerve damage.	general
Kidney disease.	general
Having a body mass index (BMI) greater than 24 may increase your risk of diabetic neuropathy.	general
Being overweight.	general
Smoking narrows and hardens your arteries, reducing blood flow to your legs and feet.	general
This makes it more difficult for wounds to heal and damages the peripheral nerves.	general
Complications Diabetic neuropathy can cause a number of serious complications, including: Nerve damage can make you lose feeling in your feet.	general
Foot sores and cuts may silently become severely infected or turn into ulcers.	general
Even minor foot sores that don't heal can turn into ulcers.	general
In severe cases, infection can spread to the bone, and ulcers can lead to tissue death (gangrene).	general
Removal (amputation) of a toe, foot or even the lower leg may be necessary.	general
Loss of a toe, foot or leg.	general
Nerve damage can cause a joint to deteriorate, causing a condition called Charcot joint.	general
This usually occurs in the small joints in the feet.	general
Symptoms include loss of sensation and joint swelling, instability and sometimes joint deformity.	general
Prompt treatment can help you heal and prevent further joint damage.	general
Joint damage.	general
If the nerves that control your bladder are damaged, you may be unable to fully empty your bladder.	general
Bacteria can build up in the bladder and kidneys, causing urinary tract infections.	general
Nerve damage can also affect your ability to feel when you need to urinate or to control the muscles that release urine, leading to leakage (incontinence).	general
Urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence.	general
Low blood sugar (below 70 milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dL) normally causes shakiness, sweating and a fast heartbeat.	general
But if you have autonomic neuropathy, you may not notice these warning signs.	general
Hypoglycemia unawareness.	general
Damage to the nerves that control blood flow can affect your body's ability to adjust blood pressure.	general
This can cause a sharp drop in pressure when you stand after sitting (orthostatic hypotension), which may lead to dizziness and fainting.	general
Sharp drops in blood pressure.	general
If nerve damage strikes your digestive tract, you can have constipation or diarrhea, or bouts of both.	general
Diabetes-related nerve damage can lead to gastroparesis, a condition in which the stomach empties too slowly or not at all.	general
This can interfere with digestion and severely affect blood sugar levels and nutrition.	general
Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting and bloating.	general
Digestive problems.	general
Autonomic neuropathy often damages the nerves that affect the sex organs.	general
Men may experience erectile dysfunction.	general
Women may have difficulty with lubrication and arousal.	general
Sexual dysfunction.	general
Nerve damage can disrupt how your sweat glands work and make it difficult for your body to control its temperature properly.	general
Some people with autonomic neuropathy have excessive sweating, particularly at night or while eating.	general
Too little or no sweating at all (anhidrosis) can be life-threatening.	general
Increased or decreased sweating.	general
More Information You can prevent or delay diabetic neuropathy and its complications by keeping tight control of your blood sugar and taking good care of your feet.	general
Blood sugar control Use an at-home blood sugar monitor to check your blood sugar and make sure it consistently stays within target range.	general
It's important to do this on schedule.	general
Shifts in blood sugar levels can accelerate nerve damage.	general
The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with diabetes have the A1C test at least twice a year.	general
This blood test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months.	general
If your blood sugar isn't well-controlled or you change medications, you may need to get tested more often.	general
Follow your doctor's recommendations for good foot care.	general
Foot problems, including sores that don't heal, ulcers and even amputation, are a common complication of diabetic neuropathy.	general
But you can prevent many of these problems by having a comprehensive foot exam at least once a year, having your doctor check your feet at each office visit and taking good care of your feet at home.	general
To protect the health of your feet: Look for blisters, cuts, bruises, cracked and peeling skin, redness, and swelling.	general
Use a mirror or ask a friend or family member to help examine parts of your feet that are hard to see.	general
Check your feet every day.	general
Wash your feet every day with lukewarm water and mild soap.	general
Avoid soaking your feet.	general
Dry your feet and between your toes carefully by blotting or patting with a soft towel.	general
Keep your feet clean and dry.	general
Moisturize your feet thoroughly to prevent cracking.	general
Avoid getting lotion between your toes, however, as this can encourage fungal growth.	general
Cut your toenails straight across, and file the edges carefully so there are no sharp edges.	general
Trim your toenails carefully.	general
Look for socks made of cotton or moisture-wicking fibers that don't have tight bands or thick seams.	general
Wear clean, dry socks.	general
Always wear shoes or slippers to protect your feet from injury.	general
Make sure that your shoes fit properly and allow your toes to move.	general
A podiatrist (foot doctor) can teach you how to buy properly fitted shoes and to prevent problems such as corns and calluses.	general
Wear cushioned shoes that fit well.	general
If problems do occur, your doctor can help treat them to prevent more-serious conditions.	general
Even small sores can quickly turn into severe infections if left untreated.	general
If you qualify for Medicare, your plan may cover the cost of at least one pair of shoes each year.	general
Talk to your doctor or diabetes educator for more information.	general
Diabetic retinopathy (die-uh-BET-ik ret-ih-NOP-uh-thee) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes.	general
It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).	general
At first, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems.	general
Eventually, it can cause blindness.	general
The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.	general
The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.	general
Products & Services You might not have symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy.	general
As the condition progresses, diabetic retinopathy symptoms may include: Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters) Blurred vision Fluctuating vision Vision loss When to see a doctor Careful management of your diabetes is the best way to prevent vision loss.	general
If you have diabetes, see your eye doctor for a yearly eye exam with dilation ‚Äî even if your vision seems fine.	general
Pregnancy may worsen diabetic retinopathy, so if you're pregnant, your eye doctor may recommend additional eye exams throughout your pregnancy.	general
Contact your eye doctor right away if your vision changes suddenly or becomes blurry, spotty or hazy.	general
More Information Diabetic retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken.	general
Tiny bulges protrude from the vessel walls, sometimes leaking or oozing fluid and blood into the retina.	general
Nerve fibers in the retina may swell, producing white spots in the retina.	general
As diabetic retinopathy progresses, new blood vessels may grow and threaten your vision.	general
Over time, too much sugar in your blood can lead to the blockage of the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina, cutting off its blood supply.	general
As a result, the eye attempts to grow new blood vessels.	general
But these new blood vessels don't develop properly and can leak easily.	general
There are two types of diabetic retinopathy: In this more common form ‚Äî called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) ‚Äî new blood vessels aren't growing (proliferating).	general
Early diabetic retinopathy.	general
When you have NPDR, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken.	general
Tiny bulges (microaneurysms) protrude from the vessel walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid and blood into the retina.	general
Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter, as well.	general
NPDR can progress from mild to severe, as more blood vessels become blocked.	general
Nerve fibers in the retina may begin to swell.	general
Sometimes the central part of the retina (macula) begins to swell (macular edema), a condition that requires treatment.	general
Diabetic retinopathy can progress to this more severe type, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy.	general
In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina, and can leak into the clear, jelly-like substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous).	general
Advanced diabetic retinopathy.	general
Eventually, scar tissue stimulated by the growth of new blood vessels may cause the retina to detach from the back of your eye.	general
If the new blood vessels interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, pressure may build up in the eyeball.	general
This can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve), resulting in glaucoma.	general
Risk factors Anyone who has diabetes can develop diabetic retinopathy.	general
Risk of developing the eye condition can increase as a result of: Duration of diabetes ‚Äî the longer you have diabetes, the greater your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy Poor control of your blood sugar level High blood pressure Complications Diabetic retinopathy involves the abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina.	general
Complications can lead to serious vision problems: The new blood vessels may bleed into the clear, jelly-like substance that fills the center of your eye.	general
If the amount of bleeding is small, you might see only a few dark spots (floaters).	general
In more-severe cases, blood can fill the vitreous cavity and completely block your vision.	general
Vitreous hemorrhage.	general
Vitreous hemorrhage by itself usually doesn't cause permanent vision loss.	general
The blood often clears from the eye within a few weeks or months.	general
Unless your retina is damaged, your vision may return to its previous clarity.	general
The abnormal blood vessels associated with diabetic retinopathy stimulate the growth of scar tissue, which can pull the retina away from the back of the eye.	general
This may cause spots floating in your vision, flashes of light or severe vision loss.	general
Retinal detachment.	general
New blood vessels may grow in the front part of your eye and interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, causing pressure in the eye to build up (glaucoma).	general
This pressure can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve).	general
Eventually, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma or both can lead to complete vision loss.	general
You can't always prevent diabetic retinopathy.	general
However, regular eye exams, good control of your blood sugar and blood pressure, and early intervention for vision problems can help prevent severe vision loss.	general
If you have diabetes, reduce your risk of getting diabetic retinopathy by doing the following: Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine.	general
Try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as walking, each week.	general
Take oral diabetes medications or insulin as directed.	general
Manage your diabetes.	general
You may need to check and record your blood sugar level several times a day ‚Äî more-frequent measurements may be required if you're ill or under stress.	general
Ask your doctor how often you need to test your blood sugar.	general
Monitor your blood sugar level.	general
The glycosylated hemoglobin test, or hemoglobin A1C test, reflects your average blood sugar level for the two- to three-month period before the test.	general
For most people, the A1C goal is to be under 7 percent.	general
Ask your doctor about a glycosylated hemoglobin test.	general
.	general
Eating healthy foods, exercising regularly and losing excess weight can help.	general
Sometimes medication is needed, too.	general
Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control Smoking increases your risk of various diabetes complications, including diabetic retinopathy.	general
If you smoke or use other types of tobacco, ask your doctor to help you quit.	general
Contact your eye doctor right away if you experience sudden vision changes or your vision becomes blurry, spotty or hazy.	general
Pay attention to vision changes.	general
Remember, diabetes doesn't necessarily lead to vision loss.	general
Taking an active role in diabetes management can go a long way toward preventing complications.	general
The Mayo Clinic experience and patient stories Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced.	general
See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.	general
Diaper rash is a common form of inflamed skin (dermatitis) that appears as a patchwork of bright red skin on your baby's bottom.	general
Diaper rash is often related to wet or infrequently changed diapers, skin sensitivity, and chafing.	general
It usually affects babies, though anyone who wears a diaper regularly can develop the condition.	general
Diaper rash can alarm parents and annoy babies.	general
But it usually clears up with simple at-home treatments, such as air drying, more frequent diaper changes and ointment.	general
Diaper rash is characterized by the following: Diaper rash is marked by red, tender-looking skin in the diaper region ‚Äî buttocks, thighs and genitals.	general
Skin signs.	general
You may notice your baby seems more uncomfortable than usual, especially during diaper changes.	general
A baby with a diaper rash often fusses or cries when the diaper area is washed or touched.	general
Changes in your baby's disposition.	general
When to see a doctor If your baby's skin doesn't improve after a few days of home treatment, talk with your doctor.	general
Sometimes, you'll need a prescription medication to treat diaper rash.	general
Have your child examined if the rash: Is severe or unusual Bleeds, itches or oozes Causes burning or pain with urination or a bowel movement Is accompanied by a fever Diaper rash can be traced to a number of sources, including: Prolonged exposure to urine or stool can irritate a baby's sensitive skin.	general
Your baby may be more prone to diaper rash if he or she is experiencing frequent bowel movements or diarrhea because feces are more irritating than urine.	general
Irritation from stool and urine.	general
Tightfitting diapers or clothing that rubs against the skin can lead to a rash.	general
Chafing or rubbing.	general
Your baby's skin may react to baby wipes, a new brand of disposable diapers, or a detergent, bleach or fabric softener used to launder cloth diapers.	general
Other substances that can add to the problem include ingredients found in some baby lotions, powders and oils.	general
Irritation from a new product.	general
What begins as a simple skin infection may spread to the surrounding region.	general
The area covered by a diaper ‚Äî buttocks, thighs and genitals ‚Äî is especially vulnerable because it's warm and moist, making a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and yeast.	general
These rashes can be found within the creases of the skin, and there may be red dots scattered around the creases.	general
Bacterial or yeast (fungal) infection.	general
As babies start to eat solid foods, the content of their stool changes.	general
This increases the likelihood of diaper rash.	general
Changes in your baby's diet can also increase the frequency of stools, which can lead to diaper rash.	general
If your baby is breast-fed, he or she may develop diaper rash in response to something the mother has eaten.	general
Introduction of new foods.	general
Babies with skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis or seborrheic dermatitis (eczema), may be more likely to develop diaper rash.	general
However, the irritated skin of atopic dermatitis and eczema primarily affects areas other than the diaper area.	general
Sensitive skin.	general
Antibiotics kill bacteria ‚Äî the good kinds as well as the bad.	general
When a baby takes antibiotics, bacteria that keep yeast growth in check may be depleted, resulting in diaper rash due to yeast infection.	general
Antibiotic use also increases the risk of diarrhea.	general
Breast-fed babies whose mothers take antibiotics are also at increased risk of diaper rash.	general
Use of antibiotics.	general
The best way to prevent diaper rash is to keep the diaper area clean and dry.	general
A few simple strategies can help decrease the likelihood of diaper rash developing on your baby's skin.	general
Remove wet or dirty diapers promptly.	general
If your child is in child care, ask staff members to do the same.	general
Change diapers often.	general
You can use a sink, tub or water bottle for this purpose.	general
Moist washcloths, cotton balls and baby wipes can aid in cleaning the skin, but be gentle.	general
Don't use wipes with alcohol or fragrance.	general
If you wish to use soap, select a mild, fragrance-free type.	general
Rinse your baby's bottom with warm water as part of each diaper change.	general
Don't scrub your baby's bottom.	general
Scrubbing can further irritate the skin.	general
Gently pat the skin dry with a clean towel or let it air dry.	general
Tight diapers prevent airflow into the diaper region, which sets up a moist environment favorable to diaper rashes.	general
Tight diapers can also cause chafing at the waist or thighs.	general
Don't overtighten diapers.	general
When possible, let your baby go without a diaper.	general
Exposing skin to air is a natural and gentle way to let it dry.	general
To avoid messy accidents, try laying your baby on a large towel and engage in some playtime while he or she is bare-bottomed.	general
Give your baby's bottom more time without a diaper.	general
If your baby gets rashes often, apply a barrier ointment during each diaper change to prevent skin irritation.	general
Petroleum jelly and zinc oxide are the time-proven ingredients in many diaper ointments.	general
Consider using ointment regularly.	general
Hand-washing can prevent the spread of bacteria or yeast to other parts of your baby's body, to you or to other children.	general
After changing diapers, wash your hands well.	general
In the past, it was common to use powders, such as cornstarch or talcum powder, to protect a baby's skin and absorb excess moisture.	general
Doctors no longer recommend this.	general
Inhaled powder can irritate a baby's lungs.	general
Cloth or disposable diapers?	general
Many parents wonder about what kind of diapers to use.	general
When it comes to preventing diaper rash, there's no compelling evidence that cloth diapers are better than disposable diapers or vice versa.	general
Because there's no one best diaper, use whatever works for you and your baby.	general
If one brand of disposable diaper irritates your baby's skin, try another.	general
If the laundry soap you use on cloth diapers seems to cause a diaper rash, switch products.	general
Whether you use cloth diapers, disposables or both kinds, always change your baby as soon as possible after he or she wets or soils the diaper to keep the bottom as clean and dry as possible.	general
Washing cloth diapers If you use cloth diapers, careful washing can help prevent diaper rash.	general
Washing methods vary and many routines work well.	general
They key is to clean, disinfect and remove soap residue.	general
Here's one effective method: Pre-soak heavily soiled cloth diapers in cold water.	general
Wash diapers in hot water with a mild detergent and bleach.	general
Bleach kills germs.	general
You could also add vinegar to the wash cycle to eliminate odors and rinse out soap residue.	general
Double rinse the diapers in cold water to remove traces of chemicals and soap.	general
Skip fabric softener and dryer sheets because they can contain fragrances that may irritate your baby's skin.	general
Colon and small intestine Colon and small intestine The small intestine and colon are components of your digestive tract, which processes the foods you eat.	general
The intestines extract nutrients from the foods.	general
What isn't absorbed by the intestines continues along the digestive tract and is expelled as stool during a bowel movement.	general
Diarrhea ‚Äî loose, watery and possibly more-frequent bowel movements ‚Äî is a common problem.	general
Luckily, diarrhea is usually short-lived, lasting no more than a few days.	general
But, when diarrhea lasts for weeks, it usually indicates that's there's another problem.	general
If you have diarrhea for weeks or longer, you may have a condition such as irritable bowel disorder, or a more serious disorder, such as a persistent infection or inflammatory bowel disease.	general
Products & Services Loose, watery stools When to see a doctor If you're an adult, see your doctor if: Your diarrhea persists beyond a few days You become dehydrated You have bloody or black stools You have a fever above 102 F (39 C) In children, particularly young children, diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration.	general
Call your doctor if your child's diarrhea doesn't improve within 24 hours or if your baby: Becomes dehydrated Has bloody or black stools A number of diseases and conditions can cause diarrhea, including Viruses that can cause diarrhea include Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus and viral hepatitis.	general
Rotavirus is a common cause of acute childhood diarrhea.	general
Contaminated food or water can transmit bacteria and parasites to your body.	general
When traveling in developing countries, diarrhea caused by bacteria and parasites is often called traveler's diarrhea.	general
Clostridium difficile is another type of bacteria that can cause serious infections that cause diarrhea, and it can occur after a course of antibiotics or during a hospitalization.	general
Bacteria and parasites.	general
Many medications, such as antibiotics, can cause diarrhea.	general
Antibiotics destroy both good and bad bacteria, which can disturb the natural balance of bacteria in your intestines.	general
Other drugs that cause diarrhea are cancer drugs and antacids with magnesium.	general
Medications.	general
Lactose is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products.	general
People who have difficulty digesting lactose have diarrhea after eating dairy products.	general
Lactose intolerance can increase with age because levels of the enzyme that helps digest lactose drop after childhood.	general
Lactose intolerance.	general
Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits and honey.	general
It's sometimes added as a sweetener to certain beverages.	general
In people who have trouble digesting fructose, it can lead to diarrhea.	general
Sorbitol and mannitol ‚Äî artificial sweeteners found in chewing gum and other sugar-free products ‚Äî can cause diarrhea in some otherwise healthy people.	general
Artificial sweeteners.	general
Abdominal or gallbladder removal surgeries can sometimes cause diarrhea.	general
Chronic diarrhea has a number of other causes, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, microscopic colitis and irritable bowel syndrome.	general
Other digestive disorders.	general
More Information Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which can be life-threatening if untreated.	general
Dehydration is particularly dangerous in children, older adults and those with weakened immune systems.	general
If you have signs of serious dehydration, seek medical help.	general
Indications of dehydration in adults These include: Excessive thirst These include: Not having a wet diaper in three or more hours Dry mouth and tongue Crying without tears Preventing viral diarrhea Wash your hands to prevent the spread of viral diarrhea.	general
To ensure adequate hand-washing: Wash your hands before and after preparing food.	general
Wash your hands after handling uncooked meat, using the toilet, changing diapers, sneezing, coughing and blowing your nose.	general
Wash frequently.	general
After putting soap on your hands, rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.	general
"This is about as long as it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice through."	general
Lather with soap for at least 20 seconds.	general
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you can't get to a sink.	general
Apply the hand sanitizer as you would hand lotion, making sure to cover the fronts and backs of both hands.	general
Use a product that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.	general
Use hand sanitizer when washing isn't possible.	general
Vaccination You can help protect your infant from rotavirus, the most common cause of viral diarrhea in children, with one of two approved vaccines.	general
Ask your baby's doctor about having your baby vaccinated.	general
Preventing traveler's diarrhea Diarrhea commonly affects people who travel to countries where there's inadequate sanitation and contaminated food.	general
To reduce your risk: Eat hot, well-cooked foods.	general
Avoid raw fruits and vegetables unless you can peel them yourself.	general
Also avoid raw or undercooked meats and dairy foods.	general
Watch what you eat.	general
Drink bottled water, soda, beer or wine served in its original container.	general
Avoid tap water and ice cubes.	general
Use bottled water even for brushing your teeth.	general
Keep your mouth closed while you shower.	general
Watch what you drink.	general
Beverages made with boiled water, such as coffee and tea, are probably safe.	general
Remember that alcohol and caffeine can aggravate diarrhea and worsen dehydration.	general
If you're traveling to a developing country for an extended time, ask your doctor about antibiotics before you go, especially if you have a weakened immune system.	general
Ask your doctor about antibiotics.	general
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains a travelers' health website where disease warnings are posted for various countries.	general
If you're planning to travel outside of the United States, check there for warnings and tips for reducing your risk.	general
Check for travel warnings.	general
Gastrointestinal tract Gastrointestinal tract Your digestive tract stretches from your mouth to your anus.	general
It includes the organs necessary to digest food and process waste.	general
Traveler's diarrhea is a digestive tract disorder that commonly causes loose stools and abdominal cramps.	general
It's caused by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water.	general
Fortunately, traveler's diarrhea usually isn't serious ‚Äî it's just unpleasant.	general
When you visit a place where the climate or sanitary practices are different from yours at home, you have an increased risk of developing traveler's diarrhea.	general
To reduce your risk of traveler's diarrhea, be careful about what you eat and drink while traveling.	general
If you do develop traveler's diarrhea, chances are it will resolve without treatment.	general
However, it's a good idea to have doctor-approved medications with you when you travel to high-risk areas in case diarrhea persists.	general
Traveler's diarrhea usually begins abruptly during your trip or shortly after you return home.	general
Most cases improve within one to two days without treatment and clear up completely within a week.	general
However, you can have multiple episodes of traveler's diarrhea during one trip.	general
The most common signs and symptoms of traveler's diarrhea are: Abrupt onset of passage of three or more loose stools a day An urgent need to defecate Abdominal cramps Sometimes, people experience moderate to severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, a high fever, bloody stools, or severe pain in the abdomen or rectum.	general
If you or your child experiences any of these signs or symptoms or if the diarrhea lasts longer than a few days, it's time to see a doctor.	general
When to see a doctor Traveler's diarrhea usually goes away on its own within several days.	general
Signs and symptoms may last longer and be more severe if the condition is caused by organisms other than common bacteria.	general
In such cases, you may need prescription medications to help you get better.	general
Your diarrhea persists beyond two days You become dehydrated You have bloody or black stools You have a fever above 102 F (39 C) A local embassy or consulate may be able to help you find a well-regarded medical professional who speaks your language.	general
For children Be especially cautious with children because traveler's diarrhea can cause severe dehydration in a short time.	general
Call a doctor if your child is sick and exhibits any of the following signs or symptoms: Persistent vomiting Bloody stools or severe diarrhea Dry mouth or crying without tears Signs of being unusually sleepy, drowsy or unresponsive Decreased volume of urine, including fewer wet diapers in infants It's possible that traveler's diarrhea may stem from the stress of traveling or a change in diet.	general
But usually an infectious agent ‚Äî including various bacteria, viruses and parasites ‚Äî is to blame.	general
You typically develop traveler's diarrhea after ingesting food or water that's contaminated with organisms from feces.	general
So why aren't natives of high-risk countries affected in the same way?	general
Often their bodies have become accustomed to the bacteria and have developed immunity to them.	general
Risk factors Central America South America Traveling to Eastern Europe, South Africa and a few Caribbean islands also poses some risk.	general
However, your risk of traveler's diarrhea is generally low in Northern and Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.	general
Your chances of getting traveler's diarrhea are mostly determined by your destination.	general
But certain groups of people have a greater risk of developing the condition.	general
These include: The condition is slightly more common in young adult tourists.	general
Though the reasons why aren't clear, it's possible that young adults lack acquired immunity.	general
They may also be more adventurous than older people in their travels and dietary choices, or they may be less vigilant in avoiding contaminated foods.	general
Young adults.	general
A weakened immune system increases vulnerability to infections.	general
People with weakened immune systems.	general
These conditions can leave you more prone to infection or increase your risk of a more-severe infection.	general
People with diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease or cirrhosis of the liver.	general
Acid in the stomach tends to destroy organisms, so a reduction in stomach acid may leave more opportunity for bacterial survival.	general
People who take acid blockers or antacids.	general
The risk of traveler's diarrhea varies by season in certain parts of the world.	general
For example, risk is highest in South Asia during the hot months just before the monsoons.	general
People who travel during certain seasons.	general
Complications Because you lose vital fluids, salts and minerals during a bout with traveler's diarrhea, you may become dehydrated.	general
Dehydration is especially dangerous for children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.	general
Dehydration caused by diarrhea can cause serious complications, including organ damage, shock or coma.	general
Signs and symptoms of dehydration include a very dry mouth, intense thirst, little or no urination, and extreme weakness.	general
Watch what you eat The general rule of thumb when traveling to another country is this: Boil it, cook it, peel it or forget it.	general
But, it's still possible to get sick even if you follow these rules.	general
Other tips that may help decrease your risk of getting sick include: Don't consume food from street vendors.	general
Avoid unpasteurized milk and dairy products, including ice cream.	general
Avoid raw or undercooked meat, fish and shellfish.	general
Steer clear of moist food at room temperature, such as sauces and buffet offerings.	general
Eat foods that are well cooked and served hot.	general
Stick to fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself, such as bananas, oranges and avocados.	general
Stay away from salads and fruits you can't peel, such as grapes and berries.	general
Be aware that alcohol in a drink won't keep you safe from contaminated water or ice.	general
Don't drink the water When visiting high-risk countries, keep the following tips in mind: Avoid unsterilized water ‚Äî from tap, well or stream.	general
If you need to consume local water, boil it for three minutes.	general
Avoid locally made ice cubes or mixed fruit juices made with tap water.	general
Beware of sliced fruit that may have been washed in contaminated water.	general
Don't swim in water that may be contaminated.	general
Keep your mouth closed while showering.	general
Feel free to drink canned or bottled drinks in their original containers ‚Äî including water, carbonated beverages, beer or wine ‚Äî as long as you break the seals on the containers yourself.	general
Wipe off any can or bottle before drinking or pouring.	general
Use bottled water to brush your teeth.	general
Use bottled or boiled water to mix baby formula.	general
Order hot beverages, such as coffee or tea, and make sure they're steaming hot.	general
If it's not possible to buy bottled water or boil your water, bring some means to purify water.	general
Consider a water-filter pump with a microstrainer filter that can filter out small microorganisms.	general
You can also chemically disinfect water with iodine or chlorine.	general
Iodine tends to be more effective, but is best reserved for short trips, as too much iodine can be harmful to your system.	general
You can purchase iodine tablets or crystals at camping stores and pharmacies.	general
Be sure to follow the directions on the package.	general
Follow additional tips Here are other ways to reduce your risk of traveler's diarrhea: Make sure dishes and utensils are clean and dry before using them.	general
Wash your hands often and always before eating.	general
If washing isn't possible, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol to clean your hands before eating.	general
Seek out food items that require little handling in preparation.	general
Keep children from putting things ‚Äî including their dirty hands ‚Äî in their mouths.	general
If possible, keep infants from crawling on dirty floors.	general
Tie a colored ribbon around the bathroom faucet to remind you not to drink ‚Äî or brush your teeth with ‚Äî tap water.	general
Other preventive measures Public health experts generally don't recommend taking antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, because doing so can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.	general
Antibiotics provide no protection against viruses and parasites, but they can give travelers a false sense of security about the risks of consuming local foods and beverages.	general
They can also cause unpleasant side effects, such as skin rashes, skin reactions to the sun and vaginal yeast infections.	general
As a preventive measure, some doctors suggest taking bismuth subsalicylate, which has been shown to decrease the likelihood of diarrhea.	general
However, don't take this medication for longer than three weeks, and don't take it at all if you're pregnant or allergic to aspirin.	general
Talk to your doctor before taking bismuth subsalicylate if you're taking certain medications, such as anticoagulants.	general
Common harmless side effects of bismuth subsalicylate include a black-colored tongue and dark stools.	general
In some cases it can cause constipation, nausea and, rarely, ringing in your ears (tinnitus).	general
People develop voice problems for many reasons.	general
Doctors who specialize in ear, nose and throat disorders and speech-language pathologists are involved in diagnosing and treating voice disorders.	general
Treatment depends on what's causing your voice disorder, but may include voice therapy, medication, injections or surgery.	general
Your voice box (larynx) is made of cartilage, muscle and mucous membranes located at the top of your windpipe (trachea) and the base of your tongue.	general
Sound is created when your vocal cords vibrate.	general
This vibration comes from air moving through the larynx, bringing your vocal cords closer together.	general
Your vocal cords also help close your voice box when you swallow, preventing you from inhaling food or liquid.	general
If your vocal cords become inflamed, develop growths or become paralyzed, they can't work properly, and you may develop a voice disorder.	general
The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects your mouth and your stomach.	general
Rings of muscle (sphincters) in the upper and lower portions contract and relax to allow food and liquid to pass.	general
Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) means it takes more time and effort to move food or liquid from your mouth to your stomach.	general
Dysphagia may also be associated with pain.	general
In some cases, swallowing may be impossible.	general
Occasional difficulty swallowing, which may occur when you eat too fast or don't chew your food well enough, usually isn't cause for concern.	general
But persistent dysphagia may indicate a serious medical condition requiring treatment.	general
Dysphagia can occur at any age, but it's more common in older adults.	general
The causes of swallowing problems vary, and treatment depends on the cause.	general
Having pain while swallowing (odynophagia) Being unable to swallow Having the sensation of food getting stuck in your throat or chest or behind your breastbone (sternum) Having frequent heartburn Having food or stomach acid back up into your throat Unexpectedly losing weight Coughing or gagging when swallowing Having to cut food into smaller pieces or avoiding certain foods because of trouble swallowing When to see a doctor See your doctor if you regularly have difficulty swallowing or if weight loss, regurgitation or vomiting accompanies your dysphagia.	general
If an obstruction interferes with breathing, call for emergency help immediately.	general
If you're unable to swallow because you feel that the food is stuck in your throat or chest, go to the nearest emergency department.	general
Swallowing is complex, and a number of conditions can interfere with this process.	general
Sometimes the cause of dysphagia can't be identified.	general
However, dysphagia generally falls into one of the following categories.	general
Esophageal dysphagia Esophageal dysphagia refers to the sensation of food sticking or getting hung up in the base of your throat or in your chest after you've started to swallow.	general
Some of the causes of esophageal dysphagia include: When your lower esophageal muscle (sphincter) doesn't relax properly to let food enter your stomach, it may cause you to bring food back up into your throat.	general
Muscles in the wall of your esophagus may be weak as well, a condition that tends to worsen over time.	general
This condition produces multiple high-pressure, poorly coordinated contractions of your esophagus, usually after you swallow.	general
Diffuse spasm affects the involuntary muscles in the walls of your lower esophagus.	general
Diffuse spasm.	general
A narrowed esophagus (stricture) can trap large pieces of food.	general
Tumors or scar tissue, often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause narrowing.	general
Esophageal stricture.	general
Difficulty swallowing tends to get progressively worse when esophageal tumors are present.	general
Esophageal tumors.	general
Sometimes food or another object can partially block your throat or esophagus.	general
Older adults with dentures and people who have difficulty chewing their food may be more likely to have a piece of food become lodged in the throat or esophagus.	general
Foreign bodies.	general
A thin area of narrowing in the lower esophagus can intermittently cause difficulty swallowing solid foods.	general
Esophageal ring.	general
Damage to esophageal tissues from stomach acid backing up into your esophagus can lead to spasm or scarring and narrowing of your lower esophagus.	general
This condition, which may be related to a food allergy, is caused by an overpopulation of cells called eosinophils in the esophagus.	general
Eosinophilic esophagitis.	general
Development of scar-like tissue, causing stiffening and hardening of tissues, can weaken your lower esophageal sphincter, allowing acid to back up into your esophagus and cause frequent heartburn.	general
Scleroderma.	general
This cancer treatment can lead to inflammation and scarring of the esophagus.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Oropharyngeal dysphagia Certain conditions can weaken your throat muscles, making it difficult to move food from your mouth into your throat and esophagus when you start to swallow.	general
You may choke, gag or cough when you try to swallow or have the sensation of food or fluids going down your windpipe (trachea) or up your nose.	general
This may lead to pneumonia.	general
Causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia include: Certain disorders ‚Äî such as multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson's disease ‚Äî can cause dysphagia.	general
Neurological disorders.	general
Sudden neurological damage, such as from a stroke or brain or spinal cord injury, can affect your ability to swallow.	general
Neurological damage.	general
A small pouch that forms and collects food particles in your throat, often just above your esophagus, leads to difficulty swallowing, gurgling sounds, bad breath, and repeated throat clearing or coughing.	general
Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum (Zenker's diverticulum).	general
Certain cancers and some cancer treatments, such as radiation, can cause difficulty swallowing.	general
Risk factors The following are risk factors for dysphagia: Due to natural aging and normal wear and tear on the esophagus and a greater risk of certain conditions, such as stroke or Parkinson's disease, older adults are at higher risk of swallowing difficulties.	general
But, dysphagia isn't considered a normal sign of aging.	general
People with certain neurological or nervous system disorders are more likely to experience difficulty swallowing.	general
Certain health conditions.	general
Complications Difficulty swallowing can lead to: Dysphagia can make it difficult to take in adequate nourishment and fluids.	general
Malnutrition, weight loss and dehydration.	general
Food or liquid entering your airway when you try to swallow can cause aspiration pneumonia, because the food can introduce bacteria to the lungs.	general
Aspiration pneumonia.	general
When food gets stuck in the throat, choking can occur.	general
If food completely blocks the airway, and no one intervenes with a successful Heimlich maneuver, death can occur.	general
Although swallowing difficulties can't be prevented, you can reduce your risk of occasional difficulty swallowing by eating slowly and chewing your food well.	general
Early detection and effective treatment of can lower your risk of developing dysphagia associated with an esophageal stricture.	general
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a bony hardening of ligaments in areas where they attach to your spine.	general
Also known as Forestier's disease, this condition might not cause symptoms or require treatment.	general
If it does cause symptoms, the most common are mild to moderate pain and stiffness in your upper back.	general
DISH can also affect your neck and lower back, and some people have DISH in other areas, such as shoulders, elbows, knees and heels.	general
DISH can be progressive.	general
As it worsens, it can cause serious complications.	general
You might have no signs or symptoms with DISH.	general
For those who have signs and symptoms, the upper portion of the back is most commonly affected.	general
Signs and symptoms might include: Stiffness may be most noticeable in the morning.	general
You might feel pain in your back or in other affected areas, such as your shoulder, elbow, knee or heel.	general
You might notice this most when stretching side to side.	general
Loss of range of motion.	general
You might have these if you have DISH in your neck.	general
Difficulty swallowing or a hoarse voice.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent pain or stiffness in any joint or in your back.	general
DISH is caused by the buildup of calcium salts in the ligaments and tendons and a hardening and overgrowth of bone.	general
But what causes these to occur is unknown.	general
Risk factors Doctors have some idea of what can increase your risk of the condition.	general
Risk factors include: Men are more likely to develop DISH.	general
DISH is most common in older adults, especially in people older than 50.	general
People with type 2 diabetes might be more likely to develop DISH than are those who don't have diabetes.	general
Other conditions that can raise insulin levels in your body may also increase your risk, including hyperinsulinemia, prediabetes and obesity.	general
Diabetes and other conditions.	general
Long-term use of medications called retinoids, such as isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others), which are used to treat skin conditions such as acne, can increase your risk.	general
Certain medications.	general
Complications People with DISH are at risk of certain complications, such as: Loss of range of motion in the affected joint can make it difficult to use that joint.	general
For instance, DISH in your shoulder can make it difficult to use your arm.	general
Disability.	general
Bone spurs in the neck can put pressure on your esophagus.	general
The pressure from bone spurs can also cause a hoarse voice or sleep apnea, a sleep disorder in which you stop breathing repeatedly during sleep.	general
Rarely, this can become serious and might require surgery to remove the bone spurs.	general
Difficulty swallowing.	general
DISH can increase your risk of breaking bones in your spine, especially if you have moderate to severe disease.	general
Even minor injuries can cause fractures.	general
Breaks might require surgery to repair.	general
Spinal fracture.	general
DiGeorge syndrome, more accurately known by a broader term ‚Äî 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome ‚Äî is a disorder caused when a small part of chromosome 22 is missing.	general
This deletion results in the poor development of several body systems.	general
The term 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome covers terms once thought to be separate conditions, including DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome and other disorders that have the same genetic cause, though features may vary slightly.	general
Medical problems commonly associated with 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome include heart defects, poor immune system function, a cleft palate, complications related to low levels of calcium in the blood, and delayed development with behavioral and emotional problems.	general
The number and severity of symptoms associated with 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome vary.	general
However, almost everyone with this syndrome needs treatment from specialists in a variety of fields.	general
Signs and symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome) can vary in type and severity, depending on what body systems are affected and how severe the defects are.	general
Some signs and symptoms may be apparent at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or early childhood.	general
Signs and symptoms may include some combination of the following: Heart murmur and bluish skin due to poor circulation of oxygen-rich blood (cyanosis) as a result of a heart defect Frequent infections Certain facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, low-set ears, wide-set eyes or a narrow groove in the upper lip A gap in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or other problems with the palate Delayed growth Breathing problems Poor muscle tone Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech Learning delays or disabilities When to see a doctor Other conditions may cause signs and symptoms similar to 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome.	general
So it's important to get an accurate and prompt diagnosis if your child shows any signs or symptoms listed above.	general
Doctors may suspect 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome: If certain conditions ‚Äî a severe heart defect, cleft palate or a combination of other factors typical of 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome ‚Äî are readily apparent at birth, diagnostic tests will likely begin before your child leaves the hospital.	general
Your family doctor or pediatrician may suspect the disorder because of a combination of illnesses or disorders that become apparent over time.	general
Other issues may come to the attention of your doctor during regularly scheduled well-baby visits or annual checkups for your child.	general
At well-baby visits.	general
Each person has two copies of chromosome 22, one inherited from each parent.	general
If a person has DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome), one copy of chromosome 22 is missing a segment that includes an estimated 30 to 40 genes.	general
Many of these genes haven't been clearly identified and aren't well-understood.	general
The region of chromosome 22 that's deleted is known as 22q11.	general
2.	general
The deletion of genes from chromosome 22 usually occurs as a random event in the father's sperm or in the mother's egg, or it may occur early during fetal development.	general
Rarely, the deletion is an inherited condition passed to a child from a parent who also has deletions in chromosome 22 but may or may not have symptoms.	general
Complications Ventricular septal defect Ventricular septal defect A ventricular septal defect is an abnormal opening (hole) in the heart that forms between the heart's lower pumping chambers (ventricles), as shown in the heart on the right.	general
This allows oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix.	general
A normal heart is shown on the left.	general
Truncus arteriosus Truncus arteriosus If you or your baby has truncus arteriosus, one large vessel leads out of the heart, instead of two separate vessels, and there's a hole in the wall between the ventricles (ventricular septal defect).	general
The oxygen-rich blood (red) and the oxygen-poor blood (blue) mix together, resulting in blood with an insufficient oxygen supply (purple) for the body.	general
Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four congenital abnormalities.	general
The four defects include a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary valve stenosis, a misplaced aorta and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy).	general
They usually result in an insufficient amount of oxygenated blood reaching the body.	general
Parathyroid glands Parathyroid glands The parathyroid glands, which lie behind the thyroid, manufacture the parathyroid hormone, which plays a role in regulating your body's levels of the minerals calcium and phosphorus.	general
Cleft palate Cleft palate A cleft palate is an opening or split in the roof of the mouth that occurs when the tissue doesn't fuse together during development in the womb.	general
A cleft palate often includes a split (cleft) in the upper lip (cleft lip) but can occur without affecting the lip.	general
Lymphatic system Lymphatic system Your body's lymphatic system is part of your immune system, which protects you against infection and disease.	general
The lymphatic system includes your spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, as well as your tonsils and adenoids.	general
The portions of chromosome 22 deleted in DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome) play a role in the development of a number of body systems.	general
As a result, the disorder can cause several errors during fetal development.	general
Common problems that occur with 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome include: 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome often causes heart defects that could result in an insufficient supply of oxygen-rich blood.	general
For example, defects may include a hole between the lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect); only one large vessel, rather than two vessels, leading out of the heart (truncus arteriosus); or a combination of four abnormal heart structures (tetralogy of Fallot).	general
Heart defects.	general
The four parathyroid glands in the neck regulate the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body.	general
22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome can cause smaller than normal parathyroid glands that secrete too little parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to hypoparathyroidism.	general
This condition results in low levels of calcium and high levels of phosphorus in the blood.	general
Hypoparathyroidism.	general
The thymus gland, located beneath the breastbone, is where T cells ‚Äî a type of white blood cell ‚Äî mature.	general
Mature T cells are needed to help fight infections.	general
In children with 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome, the thymus gland may be small or missing, resulting in poor immune function and frequent, severe infections.	general
Thymus gland dysfunction.	general
A common condition of 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome is a cleft palate ‚Äî an opening (cleft) in the roof of the mouth (palate) ‚Äî with or without a cleft lip.	general
Other, less visible abnormalities of the palate that may also be present can make it difficult to swallow or produce certain sounds in speech.	general
Cleft palate.	general
A number of particular facial features may be present in some people with 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome.	general
These may include small, low-set ears, short width of eye openings (palpebral fissures), hooded eyes, a relatively long face, an enlarged nose tip (bulbous), or a short or flattened groove in the upper lip.	general
Distinct facial features.	general
22q11.	general
2 deletion may cause problems with development and function of the brain, resulting in learning, social, developmental or behavioral problems.	general
Delays in toddler speech development and learning difficulties are common.	general
Some children develop attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder.	general
Later in life, the risk of depression, anxiety disorders and other mental health disorders increases.	general
Learning, behavioral and mental health problems.	general
People who had poor immune function as children, due to a small or missing thymus, may also have an increased risk of autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Graves' disease.	general
Autoimmune disorders.	general
A large number of medical conditions may be associated with 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome, such as hearing impairment, poor vision, breathing problems, poor kidney function and relatively short stature for one's family.	general
Other problems.	general
In some cases, DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome) may be passed from an affected parent to a child.	general
If you're concerned about a family history of 22q11.	general
2 deletion syndrome, or if you already have a child with the syndrome, you may want to consult a doctor who specializes in genetic disorders (geneticist) or a genetic counselor for help in planning future pregnancies.	general
One sign of diphtheria is swollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes) in the neck.	general
Diphtheria (dif-THEER-e-uh) is a serious bacterial infection usually affecting the mucous membranes of your nose and throat.	general
Diphtheria typically causes a sore throat, fever, swollen glands and weakness.	general
But the hallmark sign is a sheet of thick, gray material covering the back of your throat, which can block your airway, causing you to struggle for breath.	general
Diphtheria is extremely rare in the United States and other developed countries, thanks to widespread vaccination against the disease.	general
Medications are available to treat diphtheria.	general
However, in advanced stages, diphtheria can damage your heart, kidneys and nervous system.	general
Even with treatment, diphtheria can be deadly ‚Äî up to 3 percent of people who get diphtheria die of it.	general
The rate is higher for children under 15.	general
Diphtheria signs and symptoms usually begin two to five days after a person becomes infected and may include: A thick, gray membrane covering your throat and tonsils A sore throat and hoarseness Swollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes) in your neck Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing Nasal discharge In some people, infection with diphtheria-causing bacteria causes only a mild illness ‚Äî or no obvious signs and symptoms at all.	general
Infected people who remain unaware of their illness are known as carriers of diphtheria, because they can spread the infection without being sick themselves.	general
Skin (cutaneous) diphtheria A second type of diphtheria can affect the skin, causing the typical pain, redness and swelling associated with other bacterial skin infections.	general
Ulcers covered by a gray membrane also may develop in cutaneous diphtheria.	general
Although it's more common in tropical climates, cutaneous diphtheria also occurs in the United States, particularly among people with poor hygiene who live in crowded conditions.	general
When to see a doctor Call your family doctor immediately if you or your child has been exposed to someone with diphtheria.	general
If you're not sure whether your child has been vaccinated against diphtheria, schedule an appointment.	general
Make sure your own immunizations are current.	general
The bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes diphtheria.	general
Usually C. diphtheriae multiplies on or near the surface of the mucous membranes of the throat.	general
C. diphtheriae spreads via three routes: When an infected person's sneeze or cough releases a mist of contaminated droplets, people nearby may inhale C. diphtheriae.	general
Diphtheria spreads efficiently this way, particularly in crowded conditions.	general
Airborne droplets.	general
People occasionally catch diphtheria from handling an infected person's used tissues, drinking from the infected person's unwashed glass or coming into similarly close contact with other items on which bacteria-laden secretions may be deposited.	general
Contaminated personal items.	general
In rare cases, diphtheria spreads on shared household items, such as towels or toys.	general
Contaminated household items.	general
You can also come in contact with diphtheria-causing bacteria by touching an infected wound.	general
People who have been infected by the diphtheria bacteria and who haven't been treated can infect nonimmune people for up to six weeks ‚Äî even if they don't show any symptoms.	general
Risk factors People who are at increased risk of contracting diphtheria include: Children and adults who don't have up-to-date immunizations People living in crowded or unsanitary conditions Anyone who travels to an area where diphtheria is endemic Diphtheria rarely occurs in the United States and Western Europe, where health officials have been vaccinating children against the condition for decades.	general
However, diphtheria is still common in developing countries where immunization rates are low.	general
In areas where diphtheria vaccination is standard, the disease is mainly a threat to unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated people who travel internationally or have contact with people from less-developed countries.	general
Complications Left untreated, diphtheria can lead to: Diphtheria-causing bacteria may produce a toxin.	general
This toxin damages tissue in the immediate area of infection ‚Äî usually, the nose and throat.	general
At that site, the infection produces a tough, gray-colored membrane composed of dead cells, bacteria and other substances.	general
This membrane can obstruct breathing.	general
Breathing problems.	general
The diphtheria toxin may spread through your bloodstream and damage other tissues in your body, such as your heart muscle, causing such complications as inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis).	general
Heart damage from myocarditis may be slight, showing up as minor abnormalities on an electrocardiogram, or severe, leading to congestive heart failure and sudden death.	general
Heart damage.	general
The toxin can also cause nerve damage.	general
Typical targets are nerves to the throat, where poor nerve conduction may cause difficulty swallowing.	general
Nerves to the arms and legs also may become inflamed, causing muscle weakness.	general
If C. diphtheria toxin damages the nerves that help control muscles used in breathing, these muscles may become paralyzed.	general
Respiration may then become impossible without a respirator or another device to assist with breathing.	general
Nerve damage.	general
With treatment, most people with diphtheria survive these complications, but recovery is often slow.	general
Diphtheria is fatal in as many as 3 percent of those who get the disease.	general
Before antibiotics were available, diphtheria was a common illness in young children.	general
Today, the disease is not only treatable but is also preventable with a vaccine.	general
The diphtheria vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for tetanus and whooping cough (pertussis).	general
The three-in-one vaccine is known as the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine.	general
The latest version of this vaccine is known as the DTaP vaccine for children and the Tdap vaccine for adolescents and adults.	general
The diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine is one of the childhood immunizations that doctors in the United States recommend during infancy.	general
Vaccination consists of a series of five shots, typically administered in the arm or thigh, given to children at these ages: 15 to 18 months 4 to 6 years The diphtheria vaccine is effective at preventing diphtheria.	general
But there may be some side effects.	general
Some children may experience a mild fever, fussiness, drowsiness or tenderness at the injection site after a DTaP shot.	general
Ask your doctor what you can do for your child to minimize or relieve these effects.	general
Rarely, the DTaP vaccine causes serious complications in a child, such as an allergic reaction (hives or a rash develops within minutes of the injection), seizures or shock ‚Äî complications that are treatable.	general
Some children ‚Äî such as those with epilepsy or another nervous system condition ‚Äî may not be candidates for the DTaP vaccine.	general
Booster shots After the initial series of immunizations in childhood, you need booster shots of the diphtheria vaccine to help you maintain immunity.	general
That's because immunity to diphtheria fades with time.	general
Children who received all of the recommended immunizations before age 7 should receive their first booster shot at around age 11 or 12.	general
The next booster shot is recommended 10 years later, then repeated at 10-year intervals.	general
Booster shots are particularly important if you travel to an area where diphtheria is common.	general
The diphtheria booster is combined with the tetanus booster ‚Äî the tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine.	general
This combination vaccine is given by injection, usually into the arm or thigh.	general
Tdap is a combined tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine.	general
It's a one-time alternative vaccine for adolescents age 11 through 18 and adults who haven't previously had a Tdap booster.	general
It's also recommended for anyone who's pregnant, regardless of previous vaccination status.	general
Talk to your doctor about vaccines and booster shots if you're unsure of your vaccination status.	general
Tdap may also be recommended as part of the Td series for children ages 7 through 10 who aren't up to date with the vaccine schedule.	general
A dislocated elbow occurs when the bones that make up the joint are forced out of alignment ‚Äî typically when you land on an outstretched hand during a fall.	general
The elbow is the second most commonly dislocated joint after the shoulder in adults, and the most commonly dislocated joint in children.	general
Toddlers may experience a dislocated elbow, sometimes known as nursemaid's elbow, if they are lifted or swung by their forearms.	general
If you or your child has a dislocated elbow, seek immediate medical attention.	general
Complications can occur if the dislocated elbow pinches or traps the blood vessels and the nerves that serve the lower arm and hand.	general
A dislocated elbow can usually be realigned without surgery.	general
However, if your elbow is also fractured, you might need surgery.	general
Extreme pain Obvious distortion of the joint Toddlers with nursemaid's elbow might experience pain only when the affected elbow is moved.	general
A child often avoids using the arm and holds it slightly flexed next to the body.	general
Sometimes, the elbow is only partially dislocated.	general
Partial dislocation can cause bruising and pain where the ligaments were stretched or torn.	general
When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has extreme pain or obvious distortion of the elbow joint.	general
In adults, the most common causes of a dislocated elbow include: Falling onto an outstretched hand can pop the upper arm bone out of alignment within the elbow joint.	general
The same type of impact can occur when passengers in motor vehicle accidents reach forward to brace themselves before a collision.	general
Motor vehicle accidents.	general
In children or teenagers, falling onto an outstretched hand is also a common cause of a dislocated elbow.	general
In toddlers, the injury often occurs when an extra pulling motion is applied to an outstretched arm.	general
The causes of such injuries include: Trying to lift or swing a young child by the arms can cause the elbow to dislocate.	general
Improper lifting.	general
Having the child suddenly step off a curb or stairstep as you're holding his or her hand can pull the elbow out of alignment.	general
Sudden pulling.	general
Risk factors Young children's elbows are much more flexible than those of adults.	general
So it's easier for younger elbows to become dislocated.	general
Some people are born with elbow ligaments that are looser than those of most people.	general
Many elbow dislocations are sports-related.	general
Sports that require weight bearing with the arms, such as gymnastics floor exercise, are especially risky for elbow dislocations.	general
Sports participation.	general
Complications Complications of a dislocated elbow can include: The force that dislocates the elbow might also cause a fracture in one of the elbow bones.	general
Rarely, nerves that travel across the elbow can become pinched or trapped between the dislocated bones or within the joint when the bones are realigned.	general
Pinched nerves can cause numbness in the arm and hand.	general
Pinched nerves.	general
Rarely, blood vessels that supply the arm and hand can become pinched or trapped between the dislocated bones or within the realigned joint.	general
Lack of blood supply can cause severe pain and permanent tissue damage in the arm and hand.	general
Trapped arteries.	general
In some elbow dislocations, a stretched ligament will pull off a tiny bit of bone from its attachment point.	general
This type of damage is more common in children.	general
Avulsion fractures.	general
The dislocated joint may be at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in the future.	general
Osteoarthritis.	general
A dislocated shoulder is an injury in which your upper arm bone pops out of the cup-shaped socket that's part of your shoulder blade.	general
The shoulder is the body's most mobile joint, which makes it susceptible to dislocation.	general
If you suspect a dislocated shoulder, seek prompt medical attention.	general
Most people regain full shoulder function within a few weeks.	general
However, once you've had a dislocated shoulder, your joint may become unstable and be prone to repeat dislocations.	general
Products & Services Shoulder dislocation Shoulder dislocation The shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated joint of the body.	general
Because it moves in several directions, your shoulder can dislocate forward, backward or downward.	general
The most common variety is a forward (anterior) dislocation.	general
Dislocated shoulder signs and symptoms may include: A visibly deformed or out-of-place shoulder Swelling or bruising Inability to move the joint Shoulder dislocation may also cause numbness, weakness or tingling near the injury, such as in your neck or down your arm.	general
The muscles in your shoulder may spasm from the disruption, often increasing the intensity of your pain.	general
When to see a doctor Get medical help right away for a shoulder that appears dislocated.	general
While you're waiting for medical attention: Splint or sling the shoulder joint in its current position.	general
Don't try to move the shoulder or force it back into place.	general
This can damage the shoulder joint and its surrounding muscles, ligaments, nerves or blood vessels.	general
Don't move the joint.	general
Applying ice to your shoulder can help reduce pain and swelling by controlling internal bleeding and the buildup of fluids in and around your shoulder joint.	general
Ice the injured joint.	general
The shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated joint of the body.	general
Because it moves in several directions, your shoulder can dislocate forward, backward or downward, completely or partially, though most dislocations occur through the front of the shoulder.	general
In addition, fibrous tissue that joins the bones of your shoulder can be stretched or torn, often complicating the dislocation.	general
It takes a strong force, such as a sudden blow to your shoulder, to pull the bones out of place.	general
Extreme rotation of your shoulder joint can pop the ball of your upper arm bone out of your shoulder socket.	general
Partial dislocation ‚Äî in which your upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of your shoulder socket ‚Äî also may occur.	general
A dislocated shoulder may be caused by: Shoulder dislocation is a common injury in contact sports, such as football and hockey, and in sports that may involve falls, such as downhill skiing, gymnastics and volleyball.	general
Sports injuries.	general
A hard blow to your shoulder during a motor vehicle accident is a common source of dislocation.	general
Trauma not related to sports.	general
You may dislocate your shoulder during a fall, such as from a ladder or from tripping on a loose rug.	general
Risk factors Males in their teens or 20s, a group that tends to be physically active, are at highest risk of shoulder dislocation.	general
Complications Complications of a dislocated shoulder may include: Tearing of the muscles, ligaments and tendons that reinforce your shoulder joint Nerve or blood vessel damage in or around your shoulder joint Shoulder instability, especially if you have a severe dislocation or repeated dislocations, which makes you more prone to re-injury.	general
If you stretch or tear ligaments or tendons in your shoulder or damage nerves or blood vessels around your shoulder joint, you may need surgery to repair these tissues.	general
to avoid falls when you play contact sports Wear protective gear to maintain strength and flexibility in your joints and muscles Exercise regularly Once you've dislocated your shoulder joint, you may be more susceptible to future shoulder dislocations.	general
To avoid a recurrence, follow the specific strength and stability exercises that you and your doctor have discussed for your injury.	general

See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.	general
A dislocation is an injury to a joint ‚Äî a place where two or more bones come together ‚Äî in which the ends of your bones are forced from their normal positions.	general
This painful injury temporarily deforms and immobilizes your joint.	general
Dislocation is most common in shoulders and fingers.	general
Other sites include elbows, knees and hips.	general
If you suspect a dislocation, seek prompt medical attention to return your bones to their proper positions.	general
When treated properly, most dislocations return to normal function after several weeks of rest and rehabilitation.	general
However, some joints, such as your shoulder, may have an increased risk of repeat dislocation.	general
Visibly deformed or out of place Swollen or discolored When to see a doctor It can be difficult to tell a broken bone from a dislocated bone.	general
For either type of injury, get medical help right away.	general
If possible, ice the joint and keep it immobile while you're waiting to be seen.	general
Dislocations can occur in contact sports, such as football and hockey, and in sports in which falls are common, such as downhill skiing, gymnastics and volleyball.	general
Basketball players and football players also commonly dislocate joints in their fingers and hands by accidentally striking the ball, the ground or another player.	general
A hard blow to a joint during a motor vehicle accident and landing on an outstretched arm during a fall are other common causes.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for a joint dislocation include: Falling increases your chances of a dislocated joint if you use your arms to brace for impact or if you land forcefully on a body part, such as your hip or shoulder.	general
Susceptibility to falls.	general
Some people are born with ligaments that are looser and more prone to injury than those of other people.	general
Many dislocations occur during high-impact or contact sports, such as gymnastics, wrestling, basketball and football.	general
Sports participation.	general
These are the most common cause of hip dislocations, especially for people not wearing a seat belt.	general
Motor vehicle accidents.	general
Complications Complications of a joint dislocation can include: Tearing of the muscles, ligaments and tendons that reinforce the injured joint Nerve or blood vessel damage in or around your joint Susceptibility to reinjury if you have a severe dislocation or repeated dislocations Development of arthritis in the affected joint as you age Stretching or tearing of ligaments or tendons that support your injured joint or damage to nerves or blood vessels surrounding the joint might require surgery to repair these tissues.	general
To help prevent a dislocation: Get your eyes checked regularly.	general
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of the drugs you take might make you dizzy.	general
Be sure your home is well-lighted and that you remove any potential tripping hazards from the areas where you walk.	general
Take precautions to avoid falls.	general
Wear the suggested protective gear when you play contact sports.	general
Play safely.	general
Once you've dislocated a joint, you might be more susceptible to future dislocations.	general
To avoid recurrence, do strength and stability exercises as recommended by your doctor or physical therapist to improve joint support.	general
Avoid recurrence.	general
Diverticulosis and diverticulitis Diverticulosis and diverticulitis Diverticulosis occurs when small, bulging pouches (diverticula) develop in your digestive tract.	general
When one or more of these pouches become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis.	general
Diverticula are small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of your digestive system.	general
They are found most often in the lower part of the large intestine (colon).	general
Diverticula are common, especially after age 40, and seldom cause problems.	general
Sometimes, however, one or more of the pouches become inflamed or infected.	general
That condition is known as diverticulitis (die-vur-tik-yoo-LIE-tis).	general
Diverticulitis can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea and a marked change in your bowel habits.	general
Mild diverticulitis can be treated with rest, changes in your diet and antibiotics.	general
Severe or recurring diverticulitis may require surgery.	general
Products & Services The signs and symptoms of diverticulitis include: Pain, which may be constant and persist for several days.	general
The lower left side of the abdomen is the usual site of the pain.	general
Sometimes, however, the right side of the abdomen is more painful, especially in people of Asian descent.	general
Nausea and vomiting.	general
Get medical attention anytime you have constant, unexplained abdominal pain, particularly if you also have fever and constipation or diarrhea.	general
Diverticula usually develop when naturally weak places in your colon give way under pressure.	general
This causes marble-sized pouches to protrude through the colon wall.	general
Diverticulitis occurs when diverticula tear, resulting in inflammation or infection or both.	general
Risk factors The incidence of diverticulitis increases with age.	general
Being seriously overweight increases your odds of developing diverticulitis.	general
People who smoke cigarettes are more likely than nonsmokers to experience diverticulitis.	general
Vigorous exercise appears to lower your risk of diverticulitis.	general
Lack of exercise.	general
A low-fiber diet in combination with a high intake of animal fat seems to increase risk, although the role of low fiber alone isn't clear.	general
Diet high in animal fat and low in fiber.	general
Several drugs are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis, including steroids, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).	general
Certain medications Complications About 25 percent of people with acute diverticulitis develop complications, which may include: An abscess, which occurs when pus collects in the pouch.	general
A blockage in your colon or small intestine caused by scarring.	general
An abnormal passageway (fistula) between sections of bowel or the bowel and bladder.	general
Peritonitis, which can occur if the infected or inflamed pouch ruptures, spilling intestinal contents into your abdominal cavity.	general
Peritonitis is a medical emergency and requires immediate care.	general
Exercise promotes normal bowel function and reduces pressure inside your colon.	general
Try to exercise at least 30 minutes on most days.	general
Exercise regularly.	general
A high-fiber diet decreases the risk of diverticulitis.	general
Fiber-rich foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, soften waste material and help it pass more quickly through your colon.	general
Eating seeds and nuts isn't associated with developing diverticulitis.	general
Eat more fiber.	general
Fiber works by absorbing water and increasing the soft, bulky waste in your colon.	general
But if you don't drink enough liquid to replace what's absorbed, fiber can be constipating.	general
Drink plenty of fluids.	general
Dizziness is a term used to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or unsteady.	general
Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo.	general
Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors.	general
Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life.	general
But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition.	general
Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms.	general
It's usually effective, but the problem may recur.	general
Products & Services People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) Lightheadedness or feeling faint A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head.	general
Your dizziness may be accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down.	general
The episode may last seconds or days and may recur.	general
When to see a doctor Generally, see your doctor if you experience any recurrent, sudden, severe, or prolonged and unexplained dizziness or vertigo.	general
Get emergency medical care if you experience new, severe dizziness or vertigo along with any of the following: Sudden, severe headache Facial numbness or weakness Inner ear and balance Inner ear and balance Loop-shaped canals in your inner ear contain fluid and fine, hairlike sensors that help you keep your balance.	general
At the base of the canals are the utricle and saccule, each containing a patch of sensory hair cells.	general
Within these cells are tiny particles (otoconia) that help monitor the position of your head in relation to gravity and linear motion, such as going up and down in an elevator or moving forward and backward in a car.	general
Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects.	general
Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury.	general
The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes.	general
How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause.	general
Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system.	general
These include your: which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions Sensory nerves, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving.	general
With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving.	general
Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion.	general
This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving.	general
These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head.	general
is the most common cause of vertigo.	general
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).	general
A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo.	general
If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis.	general
This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear.	general
It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours.	general
You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear.	general
Meniere's disease.	general
People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache.	general
Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity.	general
Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain.	general
Causes include: A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure ‚Äî the higher number in your blood pressure reading ‚Äî may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness.	general
It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly.	general
This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension.	general
Drop in blood pressure.	general
Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness.	general
And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear.	general
Poor blood circulation.	general
Other causes of dizziness Some neurological disorders ‚Äî such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis ‚Äî can lead to progressive loss of balance.	general
Neurological conditions.	general
Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications ‚Äî such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers.	general
In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much.	general
Medications.	general
Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness.	general
These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia).	general
Anxiety disorders.	general
Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin.	general
Low iron levels (anemia).	general
This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin.	general
Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety.	general
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).	general
If you're active in hot weather or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration.	general
This is especially true if you take certain heart medications.	general
Overheating and dehydration.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance.	general
They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness.	general
If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future.	general
A past episode of dizziness.	general
Complications Dizziness can increase your risk of falling and injuring yourself.	general
Experiencing dizziness while driving a car or operating heavy machinery can increase the likelihood of an accident.	general
You may also experience long-term consequences if an existing health condition that may be causing your dizziness goes untreated.	general
A double uterus is a rare congenital abnormality.	general
In a female fetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes.	general
As the fetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ ‚Äî the uterus.	general
Sometimes, however, the tubes don't join completely.	general
Instead, each one develops into a separate structure.	general
A double uterus may have one opening (cervix) into one vagina, or each uterine cavity may have a cervix.	general
In many cases, a thin wall of tissue runs down the length of the vagina, dividing it into two separate openings.	general
Women who have a double uterus often have successful pregnancies.	general
But the condition can increase the risk of miscarriage or premature birth.	general
A double uterus often causes no symptoms.	general
The condition may be discovered during a regular pelvic exam or during imaging tests to determine the cause of repeated miscarriages.	general
Women who have a double vagina along with a double uterus may initially consult a doctor for menstrual bleeding that isn't stopped by a tampon.	general
In these situations, the woman has placed a tampon in one vagina, but blood is still escaping from the second uterus and vagina.	general
When to see a doctor Seek medical advice if you have a menstrual flow despite the insertion of a tampon, or if you have severe pain with menstruation or experience repeated miscarriages.	general
Doctors aren't certain why some fetuses develop a double uterus and others don't.	general
A genetic component may be a factor because this rare condition sometimes runs in families.	general
Complications Many women with a double uterus have normal sex lives, pregnancies and deliveries.	general
Double-outlet right ventricle Double-outlet right ventricle Double-outlet right ventricle In double-outlet right ventricle, the aorta and pulmonary artery connect partially or completely to the right ventricle.	general
A hole also exists between the two ventricles (ventricular septal defect).	general
In a normal heart, as shown on the left, the pulmonary artery connects to the right ventricle and the aorta connects to the left ventricle.	general
In double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) ‚Äî a heart condition present at birth (congenital) ‚Äî the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the body (aorta) and the artery that directs blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary artery) are partially or completely connected to the lower right heart chamber (right ventricle).	general
Sometimes these blood vessels are also reversed from their normal positions (transposed).	general
In a normal heart, the pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle and the aorta is connected to the left ventricle.	general
In people with double-outlet right ventricle, there is also a hole between the lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which can be located in several places in the wall between the ventricles.	general
This causes oxygen-rich blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle and mix with oxygen-poor blood.	general
Due to this mixing, children born with double-outlet right ventricle can have oxygen saturations that are lower than normal.	general
Too much blood flow may then be delivered through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, causing heart failure and poor growth over time.	general
In other cases, blood flow through the pulmonary artery may be reduced, which can cause your child's skin to turn a bluish color (cyanosis).	general
Your child will need surgery to correct this defect and any associated defects.	general
Some children will require surgery in the first few days after birth, and others may have surgery at a few months of age.	general
Some people may have other associated congenital heart defects, including other holes in the heart (such as an atrial septal defect), heart valve problems or blood vessel problems.	general
The presence of other heart defects may change the medications used and type of surgery performed.	general
To diagnose double-outlet right ventricle, doctors will generally perform an echocardiogram.	general
Echocardiograms use sound waves to produce an image of the heart.	general
Sound waves bounce off the heart and produce moving images that can be viewed on a video screen.	general
This test can help doctors to look closely at the heart, including the ventricles, aorta and pulmonary arteries as well as the heart valves.	general
Doctors often use this test to diagnose this condition and any associated defects, and determine the appropriate treatment.	general
If more information is needed, doctors may conduct cardiac CT and MRI scans, or cardiac catheterization.	general
In cardiac catheterization, your child's doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into an artery or vein in the groin or neck and threads it into the heart.	general
A dye is injected through the catheter to make the heart structures more visible on X-ray pictures.	general
Cardiac catheterization also measures pressure and oxygen levels in the chambers of the heart and in the blood vessels.	general
Several types of surgery may be performed, depending on the specific heart defect and any associated defects.	general
Depending on the type of defect, surgeons may: Create a tunnel (baffle) through the VSD to connect the left ventricle to the aorta Switch the aorta and pulmonary artery positions, if they are in reversed positions, in order to connect the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle and the aorta to the left ventricle Insert a patch between the ventricles to close the hole between the ventricles (VSD) Insert a blood vessel to connect the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery to allow more blood flow if the pulmonary artery is small or absent Widen the narrowed pulmonary artery to allow more blood flow Place an aorta to pulmonary artery shunt to provide more blood flow to the pulmonary arteries Conduct a series of other procedures to allow blood to move to the lungs and for the heart to function with one ventricle, if the defect is complex Repair any other congenital heart defects, such as atrial septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus In some infants with inadequate blood flow to their lungs at birth, a temporary procedure may be done to insert a shunt between the aorta and the pulmonary artery.	general
The shunt is then removed later in life during your child's definitive cardiac surgery.	general
Adults who were born with double-outlet right ventricle will need lifelong care and regular follow-up evaluations from cardiologists trained in evaluating and treating congenital heart conditions (adult congenital cardiologists) to monitor for any changes in their condition.	general
Surgery may need to be performed later in life for valve disease such as narrowing or leakage of the heart valves.	general
Some adults need close monitoring of their aortas and pulmonary arteries, especially if they required surgery early in life.	general
A small group of adults may require medications for treatment of decreased function involving the right or left ventricles.	general
The genetic basis of Down syndrome The genetic basis of Down syndrome There are 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46.	general
Half the chromosomes come from the egg (the mother) and half come from the sperm (the father).	general
This XY chromosome pair includes the X chromosome from the egg and the Y chromosome from the sperm.	general
In Down syndrome, there is an additional copy of chromosome 21, resulting in three copies instead of the normal two copies.	general
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.	general
This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome.	general
Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals, causing lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays.	general
It's the most common genetic chromosomal disorder and cause of learning disabilities in children.	general
It also commonly causes other medical abnormalities, including heart and gastrointestinal disorders.	general
Better understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly increase the quality of life for children and adults with this disorder and help them live fulfilling lives.	general
Each person with Down syndrome is an individual ‚Äî intellectual and developmental problems may be mild, moderate or severe.	general
Some people are healthy while others have significant health problems such as serious heart defects.	general
Children and adults with Down syndrome have distinct facial features.	general
Though not all people with Down syndrome have the same features, some of the more common features include: Flattened face Protruding tongue Unusually shaped or small ears Poor muscle tone Broad, short hands with a single crease in the palm Relatively short fingers and small hands and feet Excessive flexibility Tiny white spots on the colored part (iris) of the eye called Brushfield's spots Short height Infants with Down syndrome may be average size, but typically they grow slowly and remain shorter than other children the same age.	general
Intellectual disabilities Most children with Down syndrome have mild to moderate cognitive impairment.	general
Language is delayed, and both short and long-term memory is affected.	general
When to see a doctor Children with Down syndrome usually are diagnosed before or at birth.	general
However, if you have any questions regarding your pregnancy or your child's growth and development, talk with your doctor.	general
Human cells normally contain 23 pairs of chromosomes.	general
One chromosome in each pair comes from your father, the other from your mother.	general
Down syndrome results when abnormal cell division involving chromosome 21 occurs.	general
These cell division abnormalities result in an extra partial or full chromosome 21.	general
This extra genetic material is responsible for the characteristic features and developmental problems of Down syndrome.	general
Any one of three genetic variations can cause Down syndrome: About 95 percent of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 ‚Äî the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies, in all cells.	general
This is caused by abnormal cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell.	general
Trisomy 21.	general
In this rare form of Down syndrome, a person has only some cells with an extra copy of chromosome 21.	general
This mosaic of normal and abnormal cells is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization.	general
Mosaic Down syndrome.	general
Down syndrome can also occur when a portion of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) onto another chromosome, before or at conception.	general
These children have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, but they also have additional genetic material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome.	general
Translocation Down syndrome.	general
There are no known behavioral or environmental factors that cause Down syndrome.	general
Is it inherited?	general
Most of the time, Down syndrome isn't inherited.	general
It's caused by a mistake in cell division during early development of the fetus.	general
Translocation Down syndrome can be passed from parent to child.	general
However, only about 3 to 4 percent of children with Down syndrome have translocation and only some of them inherited it from one of their parents.	general
When balanced translocations are inherited, the mother or father has some rearranged genetic material from chromosome 21 on another chromosome, but no extra genetic material.	general
This means he or she has no signs or symptoms of Down syndrome, but can pass an unbalanced translocation on to children, causing Down syndrome in the children.	general
Risk factors Some parents have a greater risk of having a baby with Down syndrome.	general
Risk factors include: A woman's chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome increase with age because older eggs have a greater risk of improper chromosome division.	general
A woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down syndrome increases after 35 years of age.	general
However, most children with Down syndrome are born to women under age 35 because younger women have far more babies.	general
Advancing maternal age.	general
Both men and women can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children.	general
Being carriers of the genetic translocation for Down syndrome.	general
Parents who have one child with Down syndrome and parents who have a translocation themselves are at an increased risk of having another child with Down syndrome.	general
A genetic counselor can help parents assess the risk of having a second child with Down syndrome.	general
Having had one child with Down syndrome.	general
Complications People with Down syndrome can have a variety of complications, some of which become more prominent as they get older.	general
These complications can include: About half the children with Down syndrome are born with some type of congenital heart defect.	general
These heart problems can be life-threatening and may require surgery in early infancy.	general
Heart defects.	general
GI abnormalities occur in some children with Down syndrome and may include abnormalities of the intestines, esophagus, trachea and anus.	general
The risk of developing digestive problems, such as GI blockage, heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux) or celiac disease, may be increased.	general
Gastrointestinal (GI) defects.	general
Because of abnormalities in their immune systems, people with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, some forms of cancer, and infectious diseases, such as pneumonia.	general
Immune disorders.	general
Because of soft tissue and skeletal changes that lead to the obstruction of their airways, children and adults with Down syndrome are at greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea.	general
Sleep apnea.	general
People with Down syndrome have a greater tendency to be obese compared with the general population.	general
Some people with Down syndrome may have a misalignment of the top two vertebrae in the neck (atlantoaxial instability).	general
This condition puts them at risk of serious injury to the spinal cord from overextension of the neck.	general
Spinal problems.	general
Young children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of leukemia.	general
People with Down syndrome have a greatly increased risk of dementia ‚Äî signs and symptoms may begin around age 50.	general
Having Down syndrome also increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.	general
Down syndrome may also be associated with other health conditions, including endocrine problems, dental problems, seizures, ear infections, and hearing and vision problems.	general
Other problems.	general
For people with Down syndrome, getting routine medical care and treating issues when needed can help with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.	general
Life expectancy Life spans have increased dramatically for people with Down syndrome.	general
Today, someone with Down syndrome can expect to live more than 60 years, depending on the severity of health problems.	general
There's no way to prevent Down syndrome.	general
If you're at high risk of having a child with Down syndrome or you already have one child with Down syndrome, you may want to consult a genetic counselor before becoming pregnant.	general
A genetic counselor can help you understand your chances of having a child with Down syndrome.	general
He or she can also explain the prenatal tests that are available and help explain the pros and cons of testing.	general

Pericarditis Pericarditis The heart on the right shows a heart with pericarditis, in which the membrane (pericardium) that surrounds the heart is swollen and infected.	general
The heart on the left shows a heart with a normal pericardium.	general
Dressler's syndrome is a type of pericarditis ‚Äî inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium).	general
Dressler's syndrome is believed to be an immune system response after damage to heart tissue or to the pericardium, from events such as a heart attack, surgery or traumatic injury.	general
Symptoms include chest pain, which may be similar to chest pain experienced during a heart attack.	general
Dressler's syndrome may also be called postpericardiotomy syndrome, postmyocardial infarction syndrome and post-cardiac injury syndrome.	general
Symptoms are likely to appear weeks to months after a heart attack, surgery or injury to the chest.	general
Symptoms might include: When to see a doctor Seek emergency care for persistent chest pain, which may indicate a recurring heart attack or other disorder.	general
Dressler's syndrome is associated with an immune system response to heart damage.	general
Your body reacts to the injured tissue by sending immune cells and proteins (antibodies) to clean up and repair the affected area.	general
Sometimes this response causes excessive inflammation in the pericardium.	general
Postpericardiotomy syndrome is a well-known complication that may occur after heart surgery.	general
Complications The immune system response that leads to Dressler's syndrome might also cause fluid to accumulate in the membranes around your lungs (pleural effusion).	general
Rarely, Dressler's syndrome can cause more-serious complications, including: Inflammation of the pericardium can cause fluids to accumulate in the sac (pericardial effusion).	general
The fluid can put pressure on the heart, forcing it to work harder and reducing its ability to pump blood efficiently.	general
Cardiac tamponade.	general
Recurring or chronic inflammation can cause the pericardium to become thick or scarred.	general
The scarring can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently.	general
Constrictive pericarditis.	general
Foot drop, sometimes called drop foot, is a general term for difficulty lifting the front part of the foot.	general
If you have foot drop, the front of your foot might drag on the ground when you walk.	general
Foot drop isn't a disease.	general
Rather, foot drop is a sign of an underlying neurological, muscular or anatomical problem.	general
Sometimes foot drop is temporary, but it can be permanent.	general
If you have foot drop, you might need to wear a brace on your ankle and foot to hold your foot in a normal position.	general
Foot drop makes it difficult to lift the front part of your foot, so it might drag on the floor when you walk.	general
This can cause you to raise your thigh when you walk, as though climbing stairs (steppage gait), to help your foot clear the floor.	general
This unusual gait might cause you to slap your foot down onto the floor with each step.	general
In some cases, the skin on the top of your foot and toes feels numb.	general
Depending on the cause, foot drop can affect one or both feet.	general
When to see a doctor If your toes drag the floor when you walk, consult your doctor.	general
Foot drop is caused by weakness or paralysis of the muscles involved in lifting the front part of the foot.	general
Causes of foot drop might include: The most common cause of foot drop is compression of a nerve in your leg that controls the muscles involved in lifting the foot (peroneal nerve).	general
This nerve can also be injured during hip or knee replacement surgery, which may cause foot drop.	general
Nerve injury.	general
"A nerve root injury ‚Äî ""pinched nerve"" ‚Äî in the spine can also cause foot drop."	general
People who have diabetes are more susceptible to nerve disorders, which are associated with foot drop.	general
Various forms of muscular dystrophy, an inherited disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, can contribute to foot drop.	general
So can other disorders, such as polio or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.	general
Muscle or nerve disorders.	general
Disorders that affect the spinal cord or brain ‚Äî such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis or stroke ‚Äî may cause foot drop.	general
Brain and spinal cord disorders.	general
Risk factors The peroneal nerve controls the muscles that lift your foot.	general
This nerve runs near the surface of your skin on the side of your knee closest to your hand.	general
Activities that compress this nerve can increase your risk of foot drop.	general
Examples include: People who habitually cross their legs can compress the peroneal nerve on their uppermost leg.	general
Crossing your legs.	general
Occupations that involve prolonged squatting or kneeling ‚Äî such as picking strawberries or laying floor tile ‚Äî can result in foot drop.	general
Prolonged kneeling.	general
Plaster casts that enclose the ankle and end just below the knee can exert pressure on the peroneal nerve.	general
Wearing a leg cast.	general
A drug allergy is the abnormal reaction of your immune system to a medication.	general
Any medication ‚Äî over-the-counter, prescription or herbal ‚Äî is capable of inducing a drug allergy.	general
However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medications.	general
The most common signs and symptoms of drug allergy are hives, rash or fever.	general
A drug allergy may cause serious reactions, including a life-threatening condition that affects multiple body systems (anaphylaxis).	general
A drug allergy is not the same as a drug side effect, a known possible reaction listed on a drug label.	general
A drug allergy is also different from drug toxicity caused by an overdose of medication.	general
Signs and symptoms of a serious drug allergy often occur within an hour after taking a drug.	general
Other reactions, particularly rashes, can occur hours, days or weeks later.	general
Drug allergy signs and symptoms may include: Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening reaction to a drug allergy that causes the widespread dysfunction of body systems.	general
Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Tightening of the airways and throat, causing trouble breathing Nausea or abdominal cramps Other conditions resulting from drug allergy Less common drug allergy reactions occur days or weeks after exposure to a drug and may persist for some time after you stop taking the drug.	general
These conditions include: which may cause fever, joint pain, rash, swelling and nausea Serum sickness, a reduction in red blood cells, which can cause fatigue, irregular heartbeats, shortness of breath and other symptoms Drug-induced anemia, which results in rash, high white blood cell count, general swelling, swollen lymph nodes and recurrence of dormant hepatitis infection Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can cause fever, blood in the urine, general swelling, confusion and other symptoms Inflammation in the kidneys (nephritis), When to see a doctor Call 911 or emergency medical help if you experience signs of a severe reaction or suspected anaphylaxis after taking a medication.	general
If you have milder symptoms of a drug allergy, see your doctor as soon as possible.	general
A drug allergy occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies a drug as a harmful substance, such as a virus or bacterium.	general
Once your immune system detects a drug as a harmful substance, it will develop an antibody specific to that drug.	general
This can happen the first time you take a drug, but sometimes an allergy doesn't develop until there have been repeated exposures.	general
The next time you take the drug, these specific antibodies flag the drug and direct immune system attacks on the substance.	general
Chemicals released by this activity cause the signs and symptoms associated with an allergic reaction.	general
You may not be aware of your first exposure to a drug, however.	general
Some evidence suggests that trace amounts of a drug in the food supply, such as an antibiotic, may be sufficient for the immune system to create an antibody to it.	general
Some allergic reactions may result from a somewhat different process.	general
Researchers believe that some drugs can bind directly to a certain type of immune system white blood cell called a T cell.	general
This event sets in motion the release of chemicals that can cause an allergic reaction the first time you take the drug.	general
Drugs commonly linked to allergies Although any drug can cause an allergic reaction, some drugs are more commonly associated with allergies.	general
These include: Antibiotics, such as penicillin Pain-relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) Chemotherapy drugs for treating cancer Medications for autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis Nonallergic drug reactions Sometimes a reaction to a drug can produce signs and symptoms virtually the same as those of a drug allergy, but a drug reaction isn't triggered by immune system activity.	general
This condition is called a nonallergic hypersensitivity reaction or pseudoallergic drug reaction.	general
Drugs that are more commonly associated with this condition include: Opiates for treating pain Local anesthetics More Information Sulfa allergy Risk factors While anyone can have an allergic reaction to a drug, a few factors can increase your risk.	general
These include: A history of other allergies, such as food allergy or hay fever A personal or family history of drug allergy Increased exposure to a drug, because of high doses, repetitive use or prolonged use Certain illnesses commonly associated with allergic drug reactions, such as infection with HIV or the Epstein-Barr virus If you have a drug allergy, the best prevention is to avoid the problem drug.	general
Steps you can take to protect yourself include the following: Be sure that your drug allergy is clearly identified in your medical records.	general
Inform other health care providers, such as your dentist or any medical specialist.	general
Inform health care workers.	general
Wear a medical alert bracelet that identifies your drug allergy.	general
This information can ensure proper treatment in an emergency.	general
Wear a bracelet.	general

Salivary glands Salivary glands You have three pairs of major salivary glands ‚Äî parotid, sublingual and submandibular.	general
Each gland has its own tube (duct) leading from the gland to the mouth.	general
Dry mouth, or xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh), refers to a condition in which the salivary glands in your mouth don't make enough saliva to keep your mouth wet.	general
Dry mouth is often due to the side effect of certain medications or aging issues or as a result of radiation therapy for cancer.	general
Less often, dry mouth may be caused by a condition that directly affects the salivary glands.	general
Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acids produced by bacteria, limiting bacterial growth and washing away food particles.	general
Saliva also enhances your ability to taste and makes it easier to chew and swallow.	general
In addition, enzymes in saliva aid in digestion.	general
Decreased saliva and dry mouth can range from being merely a nuisance to something that has a major impact on your general health and the health of your teeth and gums, as well as your appetite and enjoyment of food.	general
Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause.	general
If you're not producing enough saliva, you may notice these signs and symptoms all or most of the time: Dryness or a feeling of stickiness in your mouth Saliva that seems thick and stringy Dry or sore throat and hoarseness Dry or grooved tongue Problems wearing dentures In addition, dry mouth may result in lipstick sticking to the teeth.	general
When to see a doctor If you've noticed persistent dry mouth signs and symptoms, make an appointment with your doctor.	general
Dry mouth is caused when the salivary glands in the mouth don't make enough saliva to keep your mouth wet.	general
These glands may not work properly as the result of: Hundreds of medications, including many over-the-counter drugs, produce dry mouth as a side effect.	general
Among the more likely types to cause problems are some of the drugs used to treat depression, high blood pressure and anxiety, as well as some antihistamines, decongestants, muscle relaxants and pain medications.	general
Medications.	general
Many older people experience dry mouth as they age.	general
Contributing factors include the use of certain medications, changes in the body's ability to process medication, inadequate nutrition, and having long-term health problems.	general
Chemotherapy drugs can change the nature of saliva and the amount produced.	general
This may be temporary, with normal salivary flow returning after treatment is completed.	general
Radiation treatments to your head and neck can damage salivary glands, causing a marked decrease in saliva production.	general
This may be temporary or permanent, depending on the radiation dose and area treated.	general
Cancer therapy.	general
An injury or surgery that causes nerve damage to your head and neck area can result in dry mouth.	general
Nerve damage.	general
Dry mouth can be due to certain health conditions, such as diabetes, stroke, yeast infection (thrush) in your mouth or Alzheimer's disease, or due to autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome or HIV/AIDS.	general
Snoring and breathing with your mouth open also can contribute to dry mouth.	general
Other health conditions.	general
Drinking alcohol and smoking or chewing tobacco can increase dry mouth symptoms.	general
Tobacco and alcohol use.	general
"Methamphetamine use can cause severe dry mouth and damage to teeth, a condition also known as ""meth mouth""."	general
Marijuana also can cause dry mouth.	general
Recreational drug use.	general
Dry skin isn't usually serious.	general
In most cases it's caused by factors like hot or cold weather, low moisture in the air, and soaking in hot water.	general
You can do a lot on your own to improve your skin, including using moisturizers and avoiding harsh, drying soaps.	general
But sometimes dry skin happens often or is severe.	general
In these cases, you may need help from a doctor who specializes in skin (dermatologist).	general
Dry skin is often temporary ‚Äî you get it only in winter, for example ‚Äî but it may be a lifelong condition.	general
Signs and symptoms of dry skin depend on your age, your health, where you live, time spent outdoors and the cause of the problem.	general
Dry skin is likely to cause one or more of the following: A feeling of skin tightness, especially after showering, bathing or swimming Skin that feels and looks rough Itching (pruritus) Fine lines or cracks Deep cracks that may bleed When to see a doctor Most cases of dry skin respond well to lifestyle and home remedies.	general
See your doctor if: Your skin doesn't improve in spite of your best efforts Dry skin is accompanied by redness Dryness and itching interfere with sleeping You have open sores or infections from scratching You have large areas of scaling or peeling skin Dry skin (xerosis) often has an environmental cause.	general
Certain diseases also can significantly affect your skin.	general
Potential causes of dry skin include: Skin tends to be driest in winter, when temperatures and humidity levels plummet.	general
But the season may not matter as much if you live in desert regions.	general
Central heating, wood-burning stoves, space heaters and fireplaces all reduce humidity and dry your skin.	general
Taking long, hot showers or baths can dry your skin.	general
So can frequent swimming, particularly in heavily chlorinated pools.	general
Hot baths and showers.	general
Many popular soaps, detergents and shampoos strip moisture from your skin as they are formulated to remove oil.	general
Harsh soaps and detergents.	general
People with skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or psoriasis are prone to dry skin.	general
Other skin conditions.	general
Risk factors Anyone can develop dry skin.	general
But you may be more likely to develop the condition if you: Are in your 40s or older.	general
The risk increases with age ‚Äî more than 50 percent of older adults have dry skin.	general
Live in dry, cold or low-humidity climates.	general
Have a job that requires you to immerse your skin in water, such as nursing and hairstyling.	general
Swim frequently in chlorinated pools.	general
Complications Dry skin is usually harmless.	general
But when it's not cared for, dry skin may lead to: If you're prone to develop this condition, excessive dryness can lead to activation of the disease, causing redness, cracking and inflammation.	general
Atopic dermatitis (eczema).	general
Dry skin may crack, allowing bacteria to enter, causing infections.	general
Infections.	general
These complications are most likely to occur when your skin's normal protective mechanisms are severely compromised.	general
For example, severely dry skin can cause deep cracks or fissures, which can open and bleed, providing an avenue for invading bacteria.	general
Mayo Clinic Minute: Moisturizer tips from a dermatologist Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: Moisturizer tips from a dermatologist Drink plenty of water, don't smoke, and wash your face and body each day with a gentle hypoallergenic soap for healthy-looking skin, says Dr. Dawn Davis, a Mayo Clinic dermatologist.	general
And, after bathing, moisturize with a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer when you're done to help the skin hydrate.	general
With so many products from which to choose, how do you pick the right moisturizer?	general
Dr. Davis says hypoallergenic is the key.	general
"""Unscented doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't have fragrance."	general
"Oftentimes unscented just means more chemicals,"" says Dr. Davis."	general
What ingredient should you look for?	general
The most inert natural hypoallergenic product that you can find in a moisturizer is petrolatum as in petroleum jelly.	general
"Dr. Davis has another important tip for healthy skin care that could potentially save your life: ""Please remember to wear your sunscreen""."	general
Try these tips to keep skin from getting excessively dry: Moisturizer seals skin to keep water from escaping.	general
Moisturize.	general
Keep bath and shower time to 10 minutes or less.	general
Turn the dial to warm, not hot.	general
Try to bathe no more than once a day.	general
Limit water exposure.	general
Try cleansing creams, gentle skin cleansers and shower gels with added moisturizers.	general
Skip the drying soap.	general
Winter can be especially drying to skin, so be sure to wear a scarf, hat and gloves when you go out.	general
Cover as much skin as possible in cold or windy weather.	general
If you have to immerse your hands in water or are using harsh cleansers, wearing gloves can help protect your skin.	general
Wear rubber gloves.	general
Dumping syndrome is a condition that can develop after surgery to remove all or part of your stomach or after surgery to bypass your stomach to help you lose weight.	general
The condition can also develop in people who have had esophageal surgery.	general
Also called rapid gastric emptying, dumping syndrome occurs when food, especially sugar, moves from your stomach into your small bowel too quickly.	general
Most people with dumping syndrome develop signs and symptoms, such as abdominal cramps and diarrhea, 10 to 30 minutes after eating.	general
Other people have symptoms one to three hours after eating, and still others have both early and late symptoms.	general
Generally, you can help prevent dumping syndrome by changing your diet after surgery.	general
Changes might include eating smaller meals and limiting high-sugar foods.	general
In more-serious cases of dumping syndrome, you may need medications or surgery.	general
Signs and symptoms of dumping syndrome generally occur right after eating, especially after a meal rich in table sugar (sucrose) or fruit sugar (fructose).	general
Signs and symptoms might include: Feeling bloated or too full after eating Rapid heart rate Late dumping syndrome starts one to three hours after you eat a high-sugar meal.	general
The signs and symptoms develop that long after you eat because your body releases large amounts of insulin to absorb the sugars entering your small intestine.	general
The result is low blood sugar.	general
Signs and symptoms of late dumping syndrome can include: Rapid heart rate Some people have both early and late signs and symptoms.	general
And dumping syndrome can develop years after surgery.	general
When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if any of the following apply to you.	general
You develop signs and symptoms that might be due to dumping syndrome, even if you haven't had surgery.	general
Your symptoms are not controlled by dietary changes.	general
You are losing large amounts of weight due to dumping syndrome.	general
Your doctor may refer you to a registered dietitian to help you create an eating plan.	general
Stomach and pyloric valve Stomach and pyloric valve Your stomach is a muscular sac about the size of a small melon that expands when you eat or drink to hold as much as a gallon of food or liquid.	general
Once your stomach pulverizes the food, strong muscular contractions (peristaltic waves) push the food toward the pyloric valve, which leads to the upper portion of your small intestine (duodenum).	general
In dumping syndrome, food and gastric juices from your stomach move to your small intestine in an uncontrolled, abnormally fast manner.	general
This is most often related to changes in your stomach associated with surgery.	general
Dumping syndrome can occur after any stomach surgery or major esophageal surgery, such as removal of the esophagus (esophagectomy).	general
Risk factors Gastric bypass surgery Gastric bypass surgery Before gastric bypass, food (see arrows) enters your stomach and passes into the small intestine.	general
After surgery, the amount of food you can eat is reduced due to the smaller stomach pouch.	general
Food is also redirected so that it bypasses most of your stomach and the first section of your small intestine (duodenum).	general
Food flows directly into the middle section of your small intestine (jejunum), limiting the absorption of calories.	general
Surgery that alters your stomach can increase your risk of dumping syndrome.	general
These surgeries are most commonly performed to treat obesity, but are also part of treatment for stomach cancer, esophageal cancer and other conditions.	general
These surgeries include: in which a portion or all of your stomach is removed.	general
Gastrectomy, which is performed to treat morbid obesity.	general
It surgically creates a stomach pouch smaller than the stomach, meaning that you're no longer able to eat as much as you once did.	general
It connects the small intestine to this pouch in the form of a gastrojejunostomy.	general
Gastric bypass surgery (Roux-en-Y operation), in which all or part of the tube between the mouth and the stomach is removed.	general
Dupuytren's contracture Dupuytren's contracture Dupuytren's contracture is a painless deformity of the hand in which one or more fingers (in this case, the two fingers farthest from the thumb) are bent toward the palm and can't be fully straightened.	general
It results from a thickening and scarring of connective tissue under the skin in the palm of the hand and in the fingers.	general
Dupuytren's (du-pwe-TRANZ) contracture is a hand deformity that usually develops over years.	general
The condition affects a layer of tissue that lies under the skin of your palm.	general
Knots of tissue form under the skin ‚Äî eventually creating a thick cord that can pull one or more fingers into a bent position.	general
The affected fingers can't be straightened completely, which can complicate everyday activities such as placing your hands in your pockets, putting on gloves or shaking hands.	general
Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the two fingers farthest from the thumb, and occurs most often in older men of Northern European descent.	general
A number of treatments are available to slow the progression of Dupuytren's contracture and relieve symptoms.	general
Dupuytren's contracture typically progresses slowly, over years.	general
The condition usually begins as a thickening of the skin on the palm of your hand.	general
As it progresses, the skin on your palm might appear puckered or dimpled.	general
A firm lump of tissue can form on your palm.	general
This lump might be sensitive to the touch but usually isn't painful.	general
In later stages of Dupuytren's contracture, cords of tissue form under the skin on your palm and can extend up to your fingers.	general
As these cords tighten, your fingers might be pulled toward your palm, sometimes severely.	general
The two fingers farthest from the thumb are most commonly affected, though the middle finger also can be involved.	general
Only rarely are the thumb and index finger affected.	general
Dupuytren's contracture can occur in both hands, though one hand is usually affected more severely.	general
Doctors don't know what causes Dupuytren's contracture.	general
There's no evidence that hand injuries or occupations that involve vibrations to the hands cause the condition.	general
Risk factors A number of factors are believed to increase your risk of the disease, including: Dupuytren's contracture occurs most commonly after the age of 50.	general
Men are more likely to develop Dupuytren's and to have more severe contractures than are women.	general
People of Northern European descent are at higher risk of the disease.	general
Dupuytren's contracture often runs in families.	general
Family history.	general
Smoking is associated with an increased risk of Dupuytren's contracture, perhaps because of microscopic changes within blood vessels caused by smoking.	general
Alcohol intake also is associated with Dupuytren's.	general
Tobacco and alcohol use.	general
People with diabetes are reported to have an increased risk of Dupuytren's contracture.	general
Complications Dupuytren's contracture can make it difficult to perform certain functions using your hand.	general
Since the thumb and index finger aren't usually affected, many people don't have much inconvenience or disability with fine motor activities such as writing.	general
But as Dupuytren's contracture progresses, it can limit your ability to fully open your hand, grasp large objects or to get your hand into narrow places.	general
Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical condition.	general
Dwarfism is generally defined as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches (147 centimeters) or less.	general
The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet (122 cm).	general
Many different medical conditions cause dwarfism.	general
In general, the disorders are divided into two broad categories: If body size is disproportionate, some parts of the body are small, and others are of average size or above-average size.	general
Disorders causing disproportionate dwarfism inhibit the development of bones.	general
Disproportionate dwarfism.	general
A body is proportionately small if all parts of the body are small to the same degree and appear to be proportioned like a body of average stature.	general
Medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood limit overall growth and development.	general
Proportionate dwarfism.	general
"Some people prefer the term ""short stature"" or ""little people"" rather than ""dwarf"" or ""dwarfism""."	general
So it's important to be sensitive to the preference of someone who has this disorder.	general
Short stature disorders do not include familial short stature ‚Äî short height that's considered a normal variation with normal bone development.	general
Signs and symptoms ‚Äî other than short stature ‚Äî vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders.	general
Disproportionate dwarfism Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature.	general
Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs.	general
In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body.	general
Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities.	general
Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus).	general
The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature.	general
This disorder usually results in the following: An average-size trunk Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers Limited mobility at the elbows A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose Progressive development of bowed legs Progressive development of swayed lower back An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm) Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC).	general
Signs may include: A very short trunk Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward A foot that's twisted or out of shape Instability of the neck bones Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine Progressive development of swayed lower back Vision and hearing problems Arthritis and problems with joint movement Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm) Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development.	general
So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other.	general
Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems.	general
Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism.	general
It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth.	general
Signs include: Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts Growth rate slower than expected for age Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy.	general
Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent.	general
See your child's doctor if you have any concerns about your child's growth or overall development.	general
Most dwarfism-related conditions are genetic disorders, but the causes of some disorders are unknown.	general
Most occurrences of dwarfism result from a random genetic mutation in either the father's sperm or the mother's egg rather than from either parent's complete genetic makeup.	general
Achondroplasia About 80 percent of people with achondroplasia are born to parents of average height.	general
A person with achondroplasia and with two average-size parents received one mutated copy of the gene associated with the disorder and one normal copy of the gene.	general
A person with the disorder may pass along either a mutated or normal copy to his or her own children.	general
Turner syndrome Turner syndrome, a condition that affects only girls and women, results when a sex chromosome (the X chromosome) is missing or partially missing.	general
A female inherits an X chromosome from each parent.	general
A girl with Turner syndrome has only one fully functioning copy of the female sex chromosome rather than two.	general
Growth hormone deficiency The cause of growth hormone deficiency can sometimes be traced to a genetic mutation or injury, but for most people with the disorder, no cause can be identified.	general
Other causes Other causes of dwarfism include other genetic disorders, deficiencies in other hormones or poor nutrition.	general
Sometimes the cause is unknown.	general
Complications Disproportionate dwarfism The characteristic features of the skull, spine and limbs shared by most forms of disproportionate dwarfism result in some common problems: Delays in motor skills development, such as sitting up, crawling and walking Frequent ear infections and risk of hearing loss Bowing of the legs Difficulty breathing during sleep (sleep apnea) Pressure on the spinal cord at the base of the skull Excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus) Crowded teeth Progressive severe hunching or swaying of the back with back pain or problems breathing Narrowing of the channel in the lower spine (spinal stenosis), resulting in pressure on the spinal cord and subsequent pain or numbness in the legs Weight gain that can further complicate problems with joints and the spine and place pressure on nerves Proportionate dwarfism With proportionate dwarfism, problems in growth and development often result in complications with poorly developed organs.	general
For example, heart problems that often occur with Turner syndrome can have a significant effect on health.	general
An absence of sexual maturation associated with growth hormone deficiency or Turner syndrome affects both physical development and social functioning.	general
Women with disproportionate dwarfism may develop respiratory problems during pregnancy.	general
A C-section (cesarean delivery) is almost always necessary because the size and shape of the pelvis doesn't allow for successful vaginal delivery.	general
Public perceptions Most people with dwarfism prefer not to be labeled by a condition.	general
However, some people may refer to themselves as dwarfs, little people or people of short stature.	general
"The word ""midget"" is generally considered an offensive term."	general
People of average height may have misconceptions about people with dwarfism.	general
And the portrayal of people with dwarfism in modern movies often includes stereotypes.	general
Misconceptions can impact a person's self-esteem and limit opportunities for success in school or employment.	general
Children with dwarfism are particularly vulnerable to teasing and ridicule from classmates.	general
Because dwarfism is relatively uncommon, children may feel isolated from their peers.	general
Dysarthria is a condition in which the muscles you use for speech are weak or you have difficulty controlling them.	general
Dysarthria often is characterized by slurred or slow speech that can be difficult to understand.	general
Common causes of dysarthria include nervous system (neurological) disorders such as stroke, brain injury, brain tumors, and conditions that cause facial paralysis or tongue or throat muscle weakness.	general
Certain medications also can cause dysarthria.	general
Dysarthria treatment is directed at treating the underlying cause of your condition when possible, which may improve your speech.	general
You may have speech therapy to help improve speech.	general
For dysarthria caused by prescription medications, changing or discontinuing the medications may help.	general
Signs and symptoms of dysarthria vary, depending on the underlying cause and the type of dysarthria, and may include: Slurred speech Slow speech Inability to speak louder than a whisper or speaking too loudly Rapid speech that is difficult to understand Nasal, raspy or strained voice Uneven or abnormal speech rhythm Uneven speech volume When to see a doctor Dysarthria can be a sign of a serious condition.	general
See your doctor if you have sudden or unexplained changes in your ability to speak.	general
In dysarthria, you may have difficulty moving the muscles in your mouth, face or upper respiratory system that control speech.	general
Conditions that may result in dysarthria include: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease) Brain injury Brain tumor Cerebral palsy Guillain-Barre syndrome Head injury Huntington's disease Lyme disease Multiple sclerosis Muscular dystrophy Myasthenia gravis Parkinson's disease Wilson's disease Some medications, such as narcotics or sedatives, also can cause dysarthria.	general
Complications Because of the communication problems dysarthria causes, complications can include: Communication problems may affect your relationships with family and friends and make social situations challenging.	general
Social difficulty.	general
In some people, dysarthria may lead to social isolation and depression.	general
Depression.	general
Dyshidrosis Dyshidrosis Dyshidrosis causes very small, fluid-filled blisters to occur on the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands or sides of the fingers.	general
Dyshidrosis is a skin condition that causes small, fluid-filled blisters to form on the palms of the hands and sides of the fingers.	general
Sometimes the bottoms of the feet are affected too.	general
The blisters that occur in dyshidrosis generally last around three weeks and cause intense itching.	general
Once the blisters of dyshidrosis dry, your skin may appear scaly.	general
The blisters typically recur, sometimes before your skin heals completely from the previous blisters.	general
Treatment for dyshidrosis most often includes creams or ointments that you rub on the affected skin.	general
In severe cases, your doctor may suggest corticosteroid pills, such as prednisone, or injections.	general
Dyshidrosis is also called dyshidrotic eczema and pompholyx.	general
The blisters associated with dyshidrosis occur most commonly on the sides of the fingers and the palms.	general
Sometimes the soles of the feet also can be affected.	general
The blisters are usually small ‚Äî about the width of a standard pencil lead ‚Äî and grouped in clusters, with an appearance similar to tapioca.	general
In more-severe cases, the small blisters may merge to form larger blisters.	general
Skin affected by dyshidrosis can be painful and very itchy.	general
Once the blisters dry and flake off, which occurs in about three weeks, the underlying skin may be red and tender.	general
Dyshidrosis tends to recur fairly regularly for months or years.	general
When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you have a rash on your hands or feet that doesn't go away on its own.	general
The exact cause of dyshidrosis isn't known.	general
It can be associated with a similar skin disorder called atopic dermatitis (eczema), as well as with allergic conditions, such as hay fever.	general
Eruptions may be seasonal in people with nasal allergies.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for dyshidrosis include: Dyshidrosis appears to be more common during times of emotional or physical stress.	general
These include cobalt and nickel ‚Äî usually in an industrial setting.	general
Exposure to certain metals.	general
People who develop a rash after contact with certain irritants are more likely to experience dyshidrosis.	general
Sensitive skin.	general
Some people with atopic dermatitis may develop dyshidrotic eczema.	general
Atopic dermatitis.	general
Complications For most people with dyshidrosis, it's just an itchy inconvenience.	general
For others, the pain and itching may limit the use of their hands or feet.	general
Intense scratching can increase the risk of a bacterial infection developing in the affected skin.	general
Because the cause of dyshidrosis is generally unknown, there's no proven way to prevent this condition.	general
You may help prevent the condition by managing stress and avoiding exposure to metal salts, such as cobalt and nickel.	general
Good skin care practices may help protect the skin as well.	general
Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding).	general
Also called reading disability, dyslexia affects areas of the brain that process language.	general
People with dyslexia have normal intelligence and usually have normal vision.	general
Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program.	general
Emotional support also plays an important role.	general
Though there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome.	general
Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.	general
Signs of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters school, but some early clues may indicate a problem.	general
Once your child reaches school age, your child's teacher may be the first to notice a problem.	general
Severity varies, but the condition often becomes apparent as a child starts learning to read.	general
Before school Signs that a young child may be at risk of dyslexia include: Late talking Learning new words slowly Problems forming words correctly, such as reversing sounds in words or confusing words that sound alike Problems remembering or naming letters, numbers and colors Difficulty learning nursery rhymes or playing rhyming games Once your child is in school, dyslexia signs and symptoms may become more apparent, including: Reading well below the expected level for age Problems processing and understanding what he or she hears Difficulty finding the right word or forming answers to questions Problems remembering the sequence of things Difficulty seeing (and occasionally hearing) similarities and differences in letters and words Inability to sound out the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word Difficulty spelling Spending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading or writing Avoiding activities that involve reading Teens and adults Dyslexia signs in teens and adults are similar to those in children.	general
"Some common dyslexia signs and symptoms in teens and adults include: Difficulty reading, including reading aloud Slow and labor-intensive reading and writing Problems spelling Mispronouncing names or words, or problems retrieving words Trouble understanding jokes or expressions that have a meaning not easily understood from the specific words (idioms), such as ""piece of cake"" meaning ""easy"" Spending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading or writing Difficulty summarizing a story Difficulty memorizing When to see a doctor Though most children are ready to learn reading by kindergarten or first grade, children with dyslexia often can't grasp the basics of reading by that time."	general
Talk with your doctor if your child's reading level is below what's expected for his or her age or if you notice other signs of dyslexia.	general
When dyslexia goes undiagnosed and untreated, childhood reading difficulties continue into adulthood.	general
Dyslexia tends to run in families.	general
It appears to be linked to certain genes that affect how the brain processes reading and language, as well as risk factors in the environment.	general
Risk factors Premature birth or low birth weight Exposure during pregnancy to nicotine, drugs, alcohol or infection that may alter brain development in the fetus Individual differences in the parts of the brain that enable reading Complications Dyslexia can lead to a number of problems, including: Because reading is a skill basic to most other school subjects, a child with dyslexia is at a disadvantage in most classes and may have trouble keeping up with peers.	general
Trouble learning.	general
Left untreated, dyslexia may lead to low self-esteem, behavior problems, anxiety, aggression, and withdrawal from friends, parents and teachers.	general
Social problems.	general
The inability to read and comprehend can prevent a child from reaching his or her potential as the child grows up.	general
This can have long-term educational, social and economic consequences.	general
Problems as adults.	general
Children who have dyslexia are at increased risk of having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and vice versa.	general
ADHD can cause difficulty sustaining attention as well as hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, which can make dyslexia harder to treat.	general
Painful intercourse can occur for reasons that range from structural problems to psychological concerns.	general
Many women have painful intercourse at some point in their lives.	general
The medical term for painful intercourse is dyspareunia (dis-puh-ROO-nee-uh), defined as persistent or recurrent genital pain that occurs just before, during or after intercourse.	general
Talk to your doctor if you're having painful intercourse.	general
Treatments focus on the cause, and can help eliminate or lessen this common problem.	general
Pain only at sexual entry (penetration) Pain with every penetration, including putting in a tampon Deep pain during thrusting Throbbing pain, lasting hours after intercourse When to see a doctor If you have recurrent pain during sex, talk to your doctor.	general
Treating the problem can help your sex life, your emotional intimacy and your self-image.	general
Physical causes of painful intercourse differ, depending on whether the pain occurs at entry or with deep thrusting.	general
Emotional factors might be associated with many types of painful intercourse.	general
Pain during penetration might be associated with a range of factors, including: This is often the result of not enough foreplay.	general
A drop in estrogen levels after menopause or childbirth or during breast-feeding also can be a cause.	general
Not enough lubrication.	general
Certain medications are known to affect sexual desire or arousal, which can decrease lubrication and make sex painful.	general
These include antidepressants, high blood pressure medications, sedatives, antihistamines and certain birth control pills.	general
This includes injury or irritation from an accident, pelvic surgery, female circumcision or a cut made during childbirth to enlarge the birth canal (episiotomy).	general
Injury, trauma or irritation.	general
An infection in your genital area or urinary tract can cause painful intercourse.	general
Eczema or other skin problems in your genital area also can be the problem.	general
Inflammation, infection or skin disorder.	general
These involuntary spasms of the muscles of the vaginal wall can make penetration painful.	general
Vaginismus.	general
A problem present at birth, such as the absence of a fully formed vagina (vaginal agenesis) or development of a membrane that blocks the vaginal opening (imperforate hymen), could cause dyspareunia.	general
Congenital abnormality.	general
Deep pain usually occurs with deep penetration.	general
It might be worse in certain positions.	general
Causes include: The list includes endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine prolapse, retroverted uterus, uterine fibroids, cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids and ovarian cysts.	general
Certain illnesses and conditions.	general
Scarring from pelvic surgery, including hysterectomy, can cause painful intercourse.	general
Medical treatments for cancer, such as radiation and chemotherapy, can cause changes that make sex painful.	general
Surgeries or medical treatments.	general
Emotional factors Emotions are deeply intertwined with sexual activity, so they might play a role in sexual pain.	general
Emotional factors include: Anxiety, depression, concerns about your physical appearance, fear of intimacy or relationship problems can contribute to a low level of arousal and a resulting discomfort or pain.	general
Psychological issues.	general
Your pelvic floor muscles tend to tighten in response to stress in your life.	general
This can contribute to pain during intercourse.	general
Not every woman with dyspareunia has a history of sexual abuse, but if you have been abused, it can play a role.	general
History of sexual abuse.	general
It can be difficult to tell whether emotional factors are associated with dyspareunia.	general
Initial pain can lead to fear of recurring pain, making it difficult to relax, which can lead to more pain.	general
You might start avoiding sexual intercourse if you associate it with the pain.	general
Digestive system Digestive system The major organs in your digestive system are the liver, stomach, gallbladder, colon and small intestine.	general
Indigestion ‚Äî also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach ‚Äî is a general term that describes discomfort in your upper abdomen.	general
Indigestion is not a disease, but rather some symptoms you experience, including abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness soon after you start eating.	general
Although indigestion is common, each person may experience indigestion in a slightly different way.	general
Symptoms of indigestion may be felt occasionally or as often as daily.	general
Indigestion can be a symptom of another digestive disease.	general
Indigestion that isn't caused by an underlying disease may be eased with lifestyle changes and medication.	general
Products & Services People with indigestion may have one or more of the following symptoms: You haven't eaten much of your meal, but you already feel full and may not be able to finish eating.	general
Early fullness during a meal.	general
Fullness lasts longer than it should.	general
Uncomfortable fullness after a meal.	general
You feel a mild to severe pain in the area between the bottom of your breastbone and your navel.	general
Discomfort in the upper abdomen.	general
You feel an uncomfortable heat or burning sensation between the bottom of your breastbone and your navel.	general
Burning in the upper abdomen.	general
abdomen You feel an uncomfortable sensation of tightness due to a buildup of gas.	general
Bloating in the upper You feel as though you want to vomit.	general
Less frequent symptoms include vomiting and belching.	general
Sometimes people with indigestion also experience heartburn, but heartburn and indigestion are two separate conditions.	general
Heartburn is a pain or burning feeling in the center of your chest that may radiate into your neck or back during or after eating.	general
When to see a doctor Mild indigestion is usually nothing to worry about.	general
Consult your doctor if discomfort persists for more than two weeks.	general
Contact your doctor right away if pain is severe or accompanied by: Unintentional weight loss or loss of appetite Repeated vomiting or vomiting with blood Black, tarry stools Fatigue or weakness, which may indicate anemia Seek immediate medical attention if you have: Shortness of breath, sweating or chest pain radiating to the jaw, neck or arm Chest pain on exertion or with stress Indigestion has many possible causes.	general
Often, indigestion is related to lifestyle and may be triggered by food, drink or medication.	general
Common causes of indigestion include: Overeating or eating too quickly Fatty, greasy or spicy foods Too much caffeine, alcohol, chocolate or carbonated beverages Sometimes indigestion is caused by other digestive conditions, including: Inflammation of the stomach (gastritis) Peptic ulcers Celiac disease Reduced blood flow in the intestine (intestinal ischemia) Indigestion with no obvious cause is known as functional or nonulcer dyspepsia.	general
Complications Although indigestion doesn't usually have serious complications, it can affect your quality of life by making you feel uncomfortable and causing you to eat less.	general
You might miss work or school because of your symptoms.	general
When indigestion is caused by an underlying condition, that condition can also have its own complications.	general
Persistent depressive disorder, also called dysthymia (dis-THIE-me-uh), is a continuous long-term (chronic) form of depression.	general
You may lose interest in normal daily activities, feel hopeless, lack productivity, and have low self-esteem and an overall feeling of inadequacy.	general
These feelings last for years and may significantly interfere with your relationships, school, work and daily activities.	general
If you have persistent depressive disorder, you may find it hard to be upbeat even on happy occasions ‚Äî you may be described as having a gloomy personality, constantly complaining or incapable of having fun.	general
Though persistent depressive disorder is not as severe as major depression, your current depressed mood may be mild, moderate or severe.	general
Because of the chronic nature of persistent depressive disorder, coping with depression symptoms can be challenging, but a combination of talk therapy (psychotherapy) and medication can be effective in treating this condition.	general
Persistent depressive disorder symptoms usually come and go over a period of years, and their intensity can change over time.	general
But typically symptoms don't disappear for more than two months at a time.	general
In addition, major depression episodes may occur before or during persistent depressive disorder ‚Äî this is sometimes called double depression.	general
Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder can cause significant impairment and may include: Loss of interest in daily activities Sadness, emptiness or feeling down Hopelessness Low self-esteem, self-criticism or feeling incapable Trouble concentrating and trouble making decisions Irritability or excessive anger Avoidance of social activities Poor appetite or overeating In children, symptoms of persistent depressive disorder may include depressed mood and irritability.	general
When to see a doctor Because these feelings have gone on for such a long time, you may think they'll always be part of your life.	general
But if you have any symptoms of persistent depressive disorder, seek medical help.	general
Talk to your primary care doctor about your symptoms.	general
Or seek help directly from a mental health professional.	general
If you're reluctant to see a mental health professional, reach out to someone else who may be able to help guide you to treatment, whether it's a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.	general
If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.	general
The exact cause of persistent depressive disorder isn't known.	general
As with major depression, it may involve more than one cause, such as: People with persistent depressive disorder may have physical changes in their brains.	general
The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but they may eventually help pinpoint causes.	general
Biological differences.	general
Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression.	general
Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.	general
Brain chemistry.	general
Persistent depressive disorder appears to be more common in people whose blood relatives also have the condition.	general
Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression.	general
Inherited traits.	general
As with major depression, traumatic events such as the loss of a loved one, financial problems or a high level of stress can trigger persistent depressive disorder in some people Life events.	general
Risk factors Persistent depressive disorder often begins early ‚Äî in childhood, the teen years or young adult life ‚Äî and is chronic.	general
Certain factors appear to increase the risk of developing or triggering persistent depressive disorder, including: Having a first-degree relative with major depressive disorder or other depressive disorders Traumatic or stressful life events, such as the loss of a loved one or financial problems Personality traits that include negativity, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic History of other mental health disorders, such as a personality disorder Complications Conditions that may be linked with persistent depressive disorder include: Reduced quality of life Substance abuse School and work problems and decreased productivity Chronic pain and general medical illnesses Suicidal thoughts or behavior There's no sure way to prevent persistent depressive disorder.	general
Because it often starts in childhood or during the teenage years, identifying children at risk of the condition may help them get early treatment.	general
Strategies that may help ward off symptoms include the following: to increase your resilience and to boost your self-esteem.	general
Take steps to control stress, especially in times of crisis, to help you weather rough spells.	general
Reach out to family and friends, to help prevent symptoms from worsening.	general
Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent a relapse of symptoms.	general
Dystonia is a movement disorder in which your muscles contract involuntarily, causing repetitive or twisting movements.	general
The condition can affect one part of your body (focal dystonia), two or more adjacent parts (segmental dystonia) or all parts of your body (general dystonia).	general
The muscle spasms can range from mild to severe.	general
They may be painful, and they can interfere with your performance of day-to-day tasks.	general
There's no cure for dystonia.	general
But medications can improve symptoms.	general
Surgery is sometimes used to disable or regulate nerves or certain brain regions in people with severe dystonia.	general
Dystonia affects different people in varying ways.	general
Muscle contractions might: Begin in a single area, such as your leg, neck or arm.	general
Focal dystonia that begins after age 21 usually starts in the neck, arm or face and tends to remain focal or segmental.	general
Occur during a specific action, such as handwriting.	general
Worsen with stress, fatigue or anxiety.	general
Become more noticeable over time.	general
Areas of the body that can be affected include: Contractions cause your head to twist and turn to one side, or pull forward or backward, sometimes causing pain.	general
Neck (cervical dystonia).	general
Rapid blinking or involuntary spasms cause your eyes to close (blepharospasms) and make it difficult for you to see.	general
Spasms usually aren't painful but might increase when you're in bright light, under stress or interacting with people.	general
Your eyes might feel dry.	general
You might experience slurred speech, drooling, and difficulty chewing or swallowing.	general
Oromandibular dystonia can be painful and often occurs in combination with cervical dystonia or blepharospasms.	general
Jaw or tongue (oromandibular dystonia).	general
You might have a tight or whispering voice.	general
Voice box and vocal cords (spasmodic dystonia).	general
Some types of dystonia occur only while you do a repetitive activity, such as writing (writer's dystonia) or playing a specific musical instrument (musician's dystonia).	general
Hand and forearm.	general
When to see a doctor Early signs of dystonia often are mild, occasional and linked to a specific activity.	general
See your doctor if you're experiencing involuntary muscle contractions.	general
The exact cause of dystonia isn't known.	general
But it might involve altered nerve-cell communication in several regions of the brain.	general
Some forms of dystonia are inherited.	general
Escherichia coli (E.	general
coli) bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals.	general
Most varieties of E. coli are harmless or cause relatively brief diarrhea.	general
But a few particularly nasty strains, such as E. coli O157:H7, can cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting.	general
You may be exposed to E. coli from contaminated water or food ‚Äî especially raw vegetables and undercooked ground beef.	general
Healthy adults usually recover from infection with E. coli O157:H7 within a week, but young children and older adults have a greater risk of developing a life-threatening form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome.	general
Signs and symptoms of E. coli O157:H7 infection typically begin three or four days after exposure to the bacteria, though you may become ill as soon as one day after to more than a week later.	general
Signs and symptoms include: Diarrhea, which may range from mild and watery to severe and bloody Abdominal cramping, pain or tenderness Nausea and vomiting, in some people When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if your diarrhea is persistent, severe or bloody.	general
Among the many strains of E. coli, only a few trigger diarrhea.	general
One group of E. coli ‚Äî which includes O157:H7 ‚Äî produces a powerful toxin that damages the lining of the small intestine, which can cause bloody diarrhea.	general
You develop an E. coli infection when you ingest this strain of bacteria.	general
Unlike many other disease-causing bacteria, E. coli can cause an infection even if you ingest only small amounts.	general
Because of this, you can be sickened by E. coli from eating a slightly undercooked hamburger or from swallowing a mouthful of contaminated pool water.	general
Potential sources of exposure include contaminated food or water and person-to-person contact.	general
Contaminated food The most common way to acquire an E. coli infection is by eating contaminated food, such as: When cattle are slaughtered and processed, E. coli bacteria in their intestines can get on the meat.	general
Ground beef combines meat from many different cattle, increasing the risk of contamination.	general
Ground beef.	general
E. coli bacteria on a cow's udder or on milking equipment can get into raw milk.	general
Unpasteurized milk.	general
Runoff from cattle farms can contaminate fields where fresh produce is grown.	general
Certain vegetables, such as spinach and lettuce, are particularly vulnerable to this type of contamination.	general
Fresh produce.	general
Contaminated water Human and animal feces may pollute ground and surface water, including streams, rivers, lakes and water used to irrigate crops.	general
Although public water systems use chlorine, ultraviolet light or ozone to kill E. coli, some outbreaks have been linked to contaminated municipal water supplies.	general
Private wells are a greater cause for concern because they don't often have any disinfecting system.	general
Rural water supplies are the most likely to be contaminated.	general
Some people also have been infected after swimming in pools or lakes contaminated with feces.	general
Personal contact E. coli bacteria can easily travel from person to person, especially when infected adults and children don't wash their hands properly.	general
Family members of young children with E. coli infection are especially likely to acquire it themselves.	general
Outbreaks have also occurred among children visiting petting zoos and in animal barns at county fairs.	general
Risk factors E. coli can affect anyone who is exposed to the bacteria.	general
But some people are more likely to develop problems than are others.	general
Risk factors include: Young children and older adults are at higher risk of experiencing illness caused by E. coli and more-serious complications from the infection.	general
People who have weakened immune systems ‚Äî from AIDS or drugs to treat cancer or prevent the rejection of organ transplants ‚Äî are more likely to become ill from ingesting E. coli.	general
Weakened immune systems.	general
Riskier foods include undercooked hamburger; unpasteurized milk, apple juice or cider; and soft cheeses made from raw milk.	general
Eating certain types of food.	general
Though it's not clear why, the majority of E. coli infections in the U.S. occur from June through September.	general
Time of year.	general
Stomach acid offers some protection against E. coli.	general
If you take medications to reduce your levels of stomach acid, such as esomeprazole (Nexium), pantoprazole (Protonix), lansoprazole (Prevacid) and omeprazole (Prilosec), you may increase your risk of an E. coli infection.	general
Decreased stomach acid levels.	general
Complications Most healthy adults recover from E. coli illness within a week.	general
Some people ‚Äî particularly young children and older adults ‚Äî may develop a life-threatening form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome.	general
No vaccine or medication can protect you from E. coli-based illness, though researchers are investigating potential vaccines.	general
To reduce your chance of being exposed to E. coli, avoid risky foods and watch out for cross-contamination.	general
Risky foods Hamburgers should be well-done, with no pink showing anywhere in the meat.	general
But color isn't a reliable indicator of whether or not meat is done cooking.	general
Meat ‚Äî especially if grilled ‚Äî can brown before it's completely cooked.	general
Cook hamburgers until they're 160 F. That's why it's important to use a meat thermometer to ensure that meat is heated to at least 160 F (71 C) at its thickest point.	general
Any boxed or bottled juice kept at room temperature is likely to be pasteurized, even if the label doesn't say so.	general
Drink pasteurized milk, juice and cider.	general
Washing produce won't necessarily get rid of all E. coli ‚Äî especially in leafy greens, which provide many spots for the bacteria to attach themselves to.	general
Careful rinsing can remove dirt and reduce the amount of bacteria that may be clinging to the produce.	general
Wash raw produce thoroughly.	general
Avoid cross-contamination Use hot soapy water on knives, countertops and cutting boards before and after they come into contact with fresh produce or raw meat.	general
Wash utensils.	general
This includes using separate cutting boards for raw meat and foods, such as vegetables and fruits.	general
Never put cooked hamburgers on the same plate you used for raw patties.	general
Keep raw foods separate.	general
Wash your hands after preparing or eating food, using the toilet, or changing diapers.	general
Make sure that children also wash their hands before eating, after using the bathroom and after contact with animals.	general
Wash your hands.	general

For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Jeff Olsen.	general
An ear infection (sometimes called acute otitis media) is an infection of the middle ear, the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear.	general
Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections.	general
Because ear infections often clear up on their own, treatment may begin with managing pain and monitoring the problem.	general
Sometimes, antibiotics are used to clear the infection.	general
Some people are prone to having multiple ear infections.	general
This can cause hearing problems and other serious complications.	general
Products & Services The onset of signs and symptoms of ear infection is usually rapid.	general
Ear pain, especially when lying down Tugging or pulling at an ear Trouble sleeping Loss of balance Drainage of fluid from the ear Trouble hearing When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of an ear infection can indicate a number of conditions.	general
It's important to get an accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment.	general
Call your child's doctor if: Symptoms last for more than a day Symptoms are present in a child less than 6 months of age Ear pain is severe Your infant or toddler is sleepless or irritable after a cold or other upper respiratory infection You observe a discharge of fluid, pus or bloody fluid from the ear The middle ear includes three small bones ‚Äî the hammer (malleus), anvil (incus) and stirrup (stapes).	general
The middle ear is separated from your external ear by the eardrum and connected to the back of your nose and throat by a narrow passageway called the eustachian tube.	general
The cochlea, a snail-shaped structure, is part of your inner ear.	general
An ear infection is caused by a bacterium or virus in the middle ear.	general
This infection often results from another illness ‚Äî cold, flu or allergy ‚Äî that causes congestion and swelling of the nasal passages, throat and eustachian tubes.	general
Role of eustachian tubes The eustachian tubes are a pair of narrow tubes that run from each middle ear to high in the back of the throat, behind the nasal passages.	general
The throat end of the tubes open and close to: Regulate air pressure in the middle ear Refresh air in the ear Drain normal secretions from the middle ear Swollen eustachian tubes can become blocked, causing fluids to build up in the middle ear.	general
This fluid can become infected and cause the symptoms of an ear infection.	general
In children, the eustachian tubes are narrower and more horizontal, which makes them more difficult to drain and more likely to get clogged.	general
Role of adenoids Adenoids are two small pads of tissues high in the back of the nose believed to play a role in immune system activity.	general
Because adenoids are near the opening of the eustachian tubes, swelling of the adenoids may block the tubes.	general
This can lead to middle ear infection.	general
Swelling and irritation of adenoids is more likely to play a role in ear infections in children because children have relatively larger adenoids compared to adults.	general
Related conditions Conditions of the middle ear that may be related to an ear infection or result in similar middle ear problems include: or swelling and fluid buildup (effusion) in the middle ear without bacterial or viral infection.	general
This may occur because the fluid buildup persists after an ear infection has gotten better.	general
It may also occur because of some dysfunction or noninfectious blockage of the eustachian tubes.	general
Otitis media with effusion, occurs when fluid remains in the middle ear and continues to return without bacterial or viral infection.	general
This makes children susceptible to new ear infections and may affect hearing.	general
Chronic otitis media with effusion, an ear infection that doesn't go away with the usual treatments.	general
This can lead to a hole in the eardrum.	general
Chronic suppurative otitis media, Risk factors Risk factors for ear infections include: Children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years are more susceptible to ear infections because of the size and shape of their eustachian tubes and because their immune systems are still developing.	general
Children cared for in group settings are more likely to get colds and ear infections than are children who stay home.	general
The children in group settings are exposed to more infections, such as the common cold.	general
Group child care.	general
Babies who drink from a bottle, especially while lying down, tend to have more ear infections than do babies who are breast-fed.	general
Infant feeding.	general
Ear infections are most common during the fall and winter.	general
People with seasonal allergies may have a greater risk of ear infections when pollen counts are high.	general
Seasonal factors.	general
Exposure to tobacco smoke or high levels of air pollution can increase the risk of ear infections.	general
Poor air quality.	general
Ear infections are more common among Alaska Natives.	general
Alaska Native heritage.	general
Differences in the bone structure and muscles in children who have cleft palates may make it more difficult for the eustachian tube to drain.	general
Cleft palate.	general
Complications Most ear infections don't cause long-term complications.	general
Ear infections that happen again and again can lead to serious complications: Mild hearing loss that comes and goes is fairly common with an ear infection, but it usually gets better after the infection clears.	general
Ear infections that happen again and again, or fluid in the middle ear, may lead to more-significant hearing loss.	general
If there is some permanent damage to the eardrum or other middle ear structures, permanent hearing loss may occur.	general
Impaired hearing.	general
If hearing is temporarily or permanently impaired in infants and toddlers, they may experience delays in speech, social and developmental skills.	general
Speech or developmental delays.	general
Untreated infections or infections that don't respond well to treatment can spread to nearby tissues.	general
Infection of the mastoid, the bony protrusion behind the ear, is called mastoiditis.	general
This infection can result in damage to the bone and the formation of pus-filled cysts.	general
Rarely, serious middle ear infections spread to other tissues in the skull, including the brain or the membranes surrounding the brain (meningitis).	general
Spread of infection.	general
Most eardrum tears heal within 72 hours.	general
In some cases, surgical repair is needed.	general
Tearing of the eardrum.	general
The following tips may reduce the risk of developing ear infections: Teach your children to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly and to not share eating and drinking utensils.	general
Teach your children to cough or sneeze into the crook of their arm.	general
If possible, limit the time your child spends in group child care.	general
A child care setting with fewer children may help.	general
Try to keep your child home from child care or school when ill.	general
Prevent common colds and other illnesses.	general
Make sure that no one smokes in your home.	general
Away from home, stay in smoke-free environments.	general
Avoid secondhand smoke.	general
If possible, breast-feed your baby for at least six months.	general
Breast milk contains antibodies that may offer protection from ear infections.	general
Breast-feed your baby.	general
Avoid propping a bottle in your baby's mouth while he or she is lying down.	general
Don't put bottles in the crib with your baby.	general
If you bottle-feed, hold your baby in an upright position.	general
Ask your doctor about what vaccinations are appropriate for your child.	general
Seasonal flu shots, pneumococcal and other bacterial vaccines may help prevent ear infections.	general
Talk to your doctor about vaccinations.	general
Swimmer's ear is an infection in the outer ear canal, which runs from your eardrum to the outside of your head.	general
It's often brought on by water that remains in your ear after swimming, creating a moist environment that aids bacterial growth.	general
Putting fingers, cotton swabs or other objects in your ears also can lead to swimmer's ear by damaging the thin layer of skin lining your ear canal.	general
Swimmer's ear is also known as otitis externa.	general
The most common cause of this infection is bacteria invading the skin inside your ear canal.	general
Usually you can treat swimmer's ear with eardrops.	general
Prompt treatment can help prevent complications and more-serious infections.	general
Outer ear infection Outer ear infection Redness of the ear canal, draining fluids and discharge of pus are signs of swimmer's ear (otitis externa).	general
Untreated, the infection can spread to nearby tissue and bone.	general
Swimmer's ear symptoms are usually mild at first, but they can worsen if your infection isn't treated or spreads.	general
Doctors often classify swimmer's ear according to mild, moderate and advanced stages of progression.	general
"Mild signs and symptoms Itching in your ear canal Slight redness inside your ear Mild discomfort that's made worse by pulling on your outer ear (pinna or auricle) or pushing on the little ""bump"" in front of your ear (tragus) Some drainage of clear, odorless fluid Moderate progression More-intense itching Increasing pain Excessive fluid drainage Feeling of fullness inside your ear and partial blockage of your ear canal by swelling, fluid and debris Decreased or muffled hearing Advanced progression Severe pain that might radiate to your face, neck or side of your head Complete blockage of your ear canal Redness or swelling of your outer ear Swelling in the lymph nodes in your neck When to see a doctor you have even mild signs or symptoms of swimmer's ear."	general
Contact your doctor if or visit the emergency room if you have: Call your doctor immediately Severe pain Swimmer's ear is an infection that's usually caused by bacteria.	general
It's less common for a fungus or virus to cause swimmer's ear.	general
Your ear's natural defenses Your outer ear canals have natural defenses that help keep them clean and prevent infection.	general
Protective features include: These secretions form a thin, water-repellent film on the skin inside your ear.	general
Cerumen is also slightly acidic, which helps further discourage bacterial growth.	general
Glands that secrete a waxy substance (cerumen).	general
Cerumen also collects dirt, dead skin cells and other debris and helps move these particles out of your ear, leaving the familiar earwax you find at the opening of your ear canal.	general
This helps prevent foreign bodies from entering the canal.	general
Cartilage that partly covers the ear canal.	general
How the infection occurs If you have swimmer's ear, your natural defenses have been overwhelmed.	general
Conditions that can weaken your ear's defenses and promote bacterial growth include: Heavy perspiration, prolonged humid weather or water that remains in your ear after swimming can create a favorable environment for bacteria.	general
Excess moisture in your ear.	general
Cleaning your ear with a cotton swab or hairpin, scratching inside your ear with a finger, or wearing earbuds or hearing aids can cause small breaks in the skin that allow bacteria to grow.	general
Scratches or abrasions in your ear canal.	general
Hair products or jewelry can cause allergies and skin conditions that promote infection.	general
Sensitivity reactions.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of swimmer's ear include: Getting water that has high bacteria levels in your ear Aggressive cleaning of the ear canal with cotton swabs or other objects Use of certain devices, such as earbuds or a hearing aid Skin allergies or irritation from jewelry, hair spray, or hair dyes Complications Swimmer's ear usually isn't serious if treated promptly, but complications can occur.	general
You might have muffled hearing that usually gets better after the infection clears.	general
Temporary hearing loss.	general
An outer ear infection is usually considered chronic if signs and symptoms persist for more than three months.	general
Chronic infections are more common if there are conditions that make treatment difficult, such as a rare strain of bacteria, an allergic skin reaction, an allergic reaction to antibiotic eardrops, a skin condition such as dermatitis or psoriasis, or a combination of a bacterial and a fungal infection.	general
Long-term infection (chronic otitis externa).	general
Rarely, swimmer's ear can spread into deep layers and connective tissues of the skin.	general
Deep tissue infection (cellulitis).	general
This is a rare complication of swimmer's ear that occurs as the infection spreads to the cartilage of the outer ear and bones of the lower part of the skull, causing increasingly severe pain.	general
Older adults, people with diabetes or people with weakened immune systems are at increased risk of this complication.	general
Bone and cartilage damage (early skull base osteomyelitis).	general
If swimmer's ear develops into advanced skull base osteomyelitis, the infection can spread and affect other parts of your body, such as the brain or nearby nerves.	general
This rare complication can be life-threatening.	general
More-widespread infection.	general
Follow these tips to avoid swimmer's ear: Dry your ears thoroughly after swimming or bathing.	general
Dry only your outer ear, wiping it slowly and gently with a soft towel or cloth.	general
Keep your ears dry.	general
Tip your head to the side to help water drain from your ear canal.	general
You can dry your ears with a blow dryer if you put it on the lowest setting and hold it at least a foot (about 0.	general
3 meters) away from the ear.	general
If you know you don't have a punctured eardrum, you can use homemade preventive eardrops before and after swimming.	general
A mixture of 1 part white vinegar to 1 part rubbing alcohol can help promote drying and prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi that can cause swimmer's ear.	general
At-home preventive treatment.	general
Pour 1 teaspoon (about 5 milliliters) of the solution into each ear and let it drain back out.	general
Similar over-the-counter solutions might be available at your drugstore.	general
Watch for signs alerting swimmers to high bacterial counts, and don't swim on those days.	general
Swim wisely.	general
Never attempt to scratch an itch or dig out earwax with items such as a cotton swab, paper clip, or hairpin.	general
Using these items can pack material deeper into your ear canal, irritate the thin skin inside your ear or break the skin.	general
Avoid putting foreign objects in your ear.	general
Put cotton balls in your ears while applying products such as hair sprays and hair dyes.	general
Protect your ears from irritants.	general
If you've recently had an ear infection or ear surgery, talk to your doctor before swimming.	general
Use caution after an ear infection or surgery.	general
Ruptured eardrum Ruptured eardrum A ruptured (perforated) eardrum prevents the proper transmission of sound waves to the middle ear and leaves the middle ear vulnerable to infectious agents, water and other foreign substances.	general
A ruptured eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation) is a hole or tear in the thin tissue that separates your ear canal from your middle ear (eardrum).	general
A ruptured eardrum can result in hearing loss.	general
It can also make your middle ear vulnerable to infections.	general
A ruptured eardrum usually heals within a few weeks without treatment.	general
But sometimes it requires a patch or surgical repair to heal.	general
Products & Services Ear pain that may subside quickly Mucuslike, pus-filled or bloody drainage from your ear Hearing loss Spinning sensation (vertigo) When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you experience signs or symptoms of a ruptured eardrum.	general
Your middle and inner ears are made up of delicate structures that are sensitive to injury or disease.	general
It is important to try to figure out the cause of your ear symptoms and determine whether a ruptured eardrum has occurred.	general
The middle ear includes three small bones ‚Äî the hammer (malleus), anvil (incus) and stirrup (stapes).	general
The middle ear is separated from your external ear by the eardrum and connected to the back of your nose and throat by a narrow passageway called the eustachian tube.	general
The cochlea, a snail-shaped structure, is part of your inner ear.	general
Causes of a ruptured (perforated) eardrum may include: A middle ear infection often results in the accumulation of fluids in your middle ear.	general
Pressure from these fluids can cause the eardrum to rupture.	general
Middle ear infection (otitis media).	general
Barotrauma is stress exerted on your eardrum when the air pressure in your middle ear and the air pressure in the environment are out of balance.	general
If the pressure is severe, your eardrum can rupture.	general
Barotrauma is most often caused by air pressure changes associated with air travel.	general
Barotrauma.	general
Other events that can cause sudden changes in pressure ‚Äî and possibly a ruptured eardrum ‚Äî include scuba diving and a direct blow to the ear, such as the impact of an automobile air bag.	general
A loud sound or blast, as from an explosion or gunshot ‚Äî essentially an overpowering sound wave ‚Äî can rarely cause a tear in your eardrum.	general
Loud sounds or blasts (acoustic trauma).	general
Small objects, such as a cotton swab or hairpin, can puncture or tear the eardrum.	general
Foreign objects in your ear.	general
Severe injury, such as a skull base fracture, may cause the dislocation of or damage to middle and inner ear structures, including your eardrum.	general
Severe head trauma.	general
Complications Your eardrum (tympanic membrane) has two primary roles: When sound waves strike it, your eardrum vibrates ‚Äî the first step by which structures of your middle and inner ears translate sound waves into nerve impulses.	general
Your eardrum also acts as a barrier, protecting your middle ear from water, bacteria and other foreign substances.	general
Protection.	general
If your eardrum ruptures, uncommon problems can occur, especially if it fails to self-heal after three to six months.	general
Possible complications include: Usually, hearing loss is temporary, lasting only until the tear or hole in your eardrum has healed.	general
The size and location of the tear can affect the degree of hearing loss.	general
Hearing loss.	general
A ruptured (perforated) eardrum can allow bacteria to enter the ear.	general
If a perforated eardrum doesn't heal, a small number of people may be vulnerable to ongoing (recurrent or chronic) infections.	general
In this small group, chronic drainage and hearing loss can occur.	general
Middle ear infection (otitis media).	general
Although very rare, this cyst, which is composed of skin cells and other debris, can develop in your middle ear as a long-term result of eardrum rupture.	general
Middle ear cyst (cholesteatoma).	general
Ear canal debris normally travels to your outer ear with the help of ear-protecting earwax.	general
If your eardrum is ruptured, the skin debris can pass into your middle ear and form a cyst.	general
A cyst in your middle ear provides a friendly environment for bacteria and contains proteins that can damage the bones of your middle ear.	general
Follow these tips to avoid a ruptured (perforated) eardrum: Be aware of the signs and symptoms of middle ear infection, including earache, fever, nasal congestion and reduced hearing.	general
Children with middle ear infections often are fussy and may refuse to eat.	general
Seek prompt evaluation from your primary care doctor to prevent potential damage to the eardrum.	general
Get treatment for middle ear infections.	general
If possible, don't fly if you have a cold or an active allergy that causes nasal or ear congestion.	general
During takeoffs and landings, keep your ears clear with pressure-equalizing earplugs, yawning or chewing gum.	general
Protect your ears during flight.	general
Or use the Valsalva maneuver ‚Äî gently pushing air into your nose, as if blowing your nose, while pinching your nostrils and keeping your mouth closed.	general
Don't sleep during ascents and descents.	general
Never attempt to dig out excess or hardened earwax with items such as a cotton swab, paper clip or hairpin.	general
These items can easily tear or puncture your eardrum.	general
Teach your children about the damage that can be done by putting foreign objects in their ears.	general
Keep your ears free of foreign objects.	general
Avoid activities that expose your ears to explosions.	general
If your hobbies or work involves planned activities that produce explosive noise, protect your ears from unnecessary damage by wearing protective earplugs or earmuffs.	general
Guard against explosive noise.	general
Precocious puberty is when a child's body begins changing into that of an adult (puberty) too soon.	general
When puberty begins before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys, it is considered precocious puberty.	general
Puberty includes rapid growth of bones and muscles, changes in body shape and size, and development of the body's ability to reproduce.	general
The cause of precocious puberty often can't be found.	general
Rarely, certain conditions, such as infections, hormone disorders, tumors, brain abnormalities or injuries, may cause precocious puberty.	general
Treatment for precocious puberty typically includes medication to delay further development.	general
Precocious puberty signs and symptoms include development of the following before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys.	general
Breast growth and first period in girls Enlarged testicles and penis, facial hair and deepening voice in boys Pubic or underarm hair When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your child's doctor for an evaluation if your child has any of the signs or symptoms of precocious puberty.	general
To understand what causes precocious puberty in some children, it's helpful to know what causes puberty to begin.	general
The brain starts the process with the production of a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).	general
When this hormone reaches the pituitary gland ‚Äî a small bean-shaped gland at the base of your brain ‚Äî it leads to the production of more hormones in the ovaries for females (estrogen) and the testicles for males (testosterone).	general
Estrogen is involved in the growth and development of female sexual characteristics.	general
Testosterone is responsible for the growth and development of male sexual characteristics.	general
Why this process begins early in some children depends on whether they have central precocious puberty or peripheral precocious puberty.	general
Central precocious puberty The cause for this type of precocious puberty often can't be identified.	general
In central precocious puberty, the puberty process starts too soon.	general
The pattern and timing of the steps in the process are otherwise normal.	general
For the majority of children with this condition, there's no underlying medical problem and no identifiable reason for the early puberty.	general
In rare cases, central precocious puberty may be caused by: A tumor in the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) A defect in the brain present at birth, such as excess fluid buildup (hydrocephalus) or a noncancerous tumor (hamartoma) Radiation to the brain or spinal cord Injury to the brain or spinal cord McCune-Albright syndrome ‚Äî a rare genetic disease that affects bones and skin color and causes hormonal problems Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ‚Äî a group of genetic disorders involving abnormal hormone production by the adrenal glands Hypothyroidism ‚Äî a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones Peripheral precocious puberty Estrogen or testosterone in your child's body causes this type of precocious puberty.	general
The less common peripheral precocious puberty occurs without the involvement of the hormone in your brain (GnRH) that normally triggers the start of puberty.	general
Instead, the cause is release of estrogen or testosterone into the body because of problems with the ovaries, testicles, adrenal glands or pituitary gland.	general
In both girls and boys, the following may lead to peripheral precocious puberty: A tumor in the adrenal glands or in the pituitary gland that releases estrogen or testosterone McCune-Albright syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin color and bones and causes hormonal problems Exposure to external sources of estrogen or testosterone, such as creams or ointments In girls, peripheral precocious puberty may also be associated with: Ovarian cysts Ovarian tumors In boys, peripheral precocious puberty may also be caused by: A tumor in the cells that make sperm (germ cells) or in the cells that make testosterone (Leydig cells).	general
A rare disorder called gonadotropin-independent familial sexual precocity, which is caused by a defect in a gene, can result in the early production of testosterone in boys, usually between ages 1 and 4.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase a child's risk of precocious puberty include: Girls are much more likely to develop precocious puberty.	general
Being a girl.	general
Precocious puberty appears to affect African-Americans more often than children of other races.	general
Being African-American.	general
Children who are significantly overweight have a higher risk of developing precocious puberty.	general
Being obese.	general
Coming in contact with an estrogen or testosterone cream or ointment, or other substances that contain these hormones (such as an adult's medication or dietary supplements), can increase your child's risk of developing precocious puberty.	general
Being exposed to sex hormones.	general
Precocious puberty may be a complication of McCune-Albright syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia ‚Äî conditions that involve abnormal production of the male hormones (androgens).	general
In rare cases, precocious puberty may also be associated with hypothyroidism.	general
Having other medical conditions.	general
Radiation treatment for tumors, leukemia or other conditions can increase the risk of precocious puberty.	general
Having received radiation therapy of the central nervous system.	general
Complications Possible complications of precocious puberty include: Children with precocious puberty may grow quickly at first and be tall, compared with their peers.	general
But, because their bones mature more quickly than normal, they often stop growing earlier than usual.	general
This can cause them to be shorter than average as adults.	general
Early treatment of precocious puberty, especially when it occurs in very young children, can help them grow taller than they would without treatment.	general
Short height.	general
Girls and boys who begin puberty long before their peers may be extremely self-conscious about the changes occurring in their bodies.	general
This may affect self-esteem and increase the risk of depression or substance abuse.	general
Social and emotional problems.	general
Some of the risk factors for precocious puberty, such as sex and race, can't be avoided.	general
Eating disorders are serious conditions related to persistent eating behaviors that negatively impact your health, your emotions and your ability to function in important areas of life.	general
The most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder.	general
Most eating disorders involve focusing too much on your weight, body shape and food, leading to dangerous eating behaviors.	general
These behaviors can significantly impact your body's ability to get appropriate nutrition.	general
Eating disorders can harm the heart, digestive system, bones, and teeth and mouth, and lead to other diseases.	general
Eating disorders often develop in the teen and young adult years, although they can develop at other ages.	general
With treatment, you can return to healthier eating habits and sometimes reverse serious complications caused by the eating disorder.	general
Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder.	general
Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders.	general
Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.	general
Anorexia nervosa Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa ‚Äî often simply called anorexia ‚Äî is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape.	general
People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities.	general
When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight, such as excessive exercise, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating.	general
Efforts to reduce your weight, even when underweight, can cause severe health problems, sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation.	general
Bulimia nervosa Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa ‚Äî commonly called bulimia ‚Äî is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder.	general
When you have bulimia, you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating.	general
Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often leads to more binge eating and purging.	general
During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way.	general
Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods, such as laxatives, to get rid of the calories.	general
If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws.	general
You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight.	general
Binge-eating disorder When you have binge-eating disorder, you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating.	general
You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended, even when you're not hungry, and you may continue eating even long after you're uncomfortably full.	general
After a binge, you may feel guilty, disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten.	general
But you don't try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging, as someone with bulimia or anorexia might.	general
Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing.	general
A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week.	general
You may be normal weight, overweight or obese.	general
Rumination disorder Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating, but it's not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder.	general
Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging, and regurgitation may not be intentional.	general
Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out.	general
The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior.	general
The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability.	general
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you don't have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics, such as color, texture, smell or taste; or you're concerned about the consequences of eating, such as fear of choking.	general
Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight.	general
The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood, as well as nutritional deficiencies that can cause health problems.	general
When to see a doctor An eating disorder can be difficult to manage or overcome by yourself.	general
Eating disorders can virtually take over your life.	general
If you're experiencing any of these problems, or if you think you may have an eating disorder, seek medical help.	general
Urging a loved one to seek treatment Unfortunately, many people with eating disorders may not think they need treatment.	general
If you're worried about a loved one, urge him or her to talk to a doctor.	general
Even if your loved one isn't ready to acknowledge having an issue with food, you can open the door by expressing concern and a desire to listen.	general
Be alert for eating patterns and beliefs that may signal unhealthy behavior, as well as peer pressure that may trigger eating disorders.	general
Red flags that may indicate an eating disorder include: Skipping meals or making excuses for not eating Adopting an overly restrictive vegetarian diet Excessive focus on healthy eating Making own meals rather than eating what the family eats Withdrawing from normal social activities Persistent worry or complaining about being fat and talk of losing weight Frequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws Repeatedly eating large amounts of sweets or high-fat foods Use of dietary supplements, laxatives or herbal products for weight loss Excessive exercise Calluses on the knuckles from inducing vomiting Problems with loss of tooth enamel that may be a sign of repeated vomiting Leaving during meals to use the toilet Eating much more food in a meal or snack than is considered normal Expressing depression, disgust, shame or guilt about eating habits Eating in secret If you're worried that your child may have an eating disorder, contact his or her doctor to discuss your concerns.	general
If needed, you can get a referral to a qualified mental health professional with expertise in eating disorders, or if your insurance permits it, contact an expert directly.	general
The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown.	general
As with other mental illnesses, there may be many causes, such as: Certain people may have genes that increase their risk of developing eating disorders.	general
Biological factors, such as changes in brain chemicals, may play a role in eating disorders.	general
Genetics and biology.	general
People with eating disorders may have psychological and emotional problems that contribute to the disorder.	general
They may have low self-esteem, perfectionism, impulsive behavior and troubled relationships.	general
Psychological and emotional health.	general
Risk factors Teenage girls and young women are more likely than teenage boys and young men to have anorexia or bulimia, but males can have eating disorders, too.	general
Although eating disorders can occur across a broad age range, they often develop in the teens and early 20s.	general
Certain factors may increase the risk of developing an eating disorder, including: Eating disorders are significantly more likely to occur in people who have parents or siblings who've had an eating disorder.	general
Family history.	general
People with an eating disorder often have a history of an anxiety disorder, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder.	general
Other mental health disorders.	general
Dieting is a risk factor for developing an eating disorder.	general
Starvation affects the brain and influences mood changes, rigidity in thinking, anxiety and reduction in appetite.	general
There is strong evidence that many of the symptoms of an eating disorder are actually symptoms of starvation.	general
Starvation and weight loss may change the way the brain works in vulnerable individuals, which may perpetuate restrictive eating behaviors and make it difficult to return to normal eating habits.	general
Dieting and starvation.	general
Whether it's heading off to college, moving, landing a new job, or a family or relationship issue, change can bring stress, which may increase your risk of an eating disorder.	general
Complications Eating disorders cause a wide variety of complications, some of them life-threatening.	general
The more severe or long lasting the eating disorder, the more likely you are to experience serious complications, such as: Serious health problems Depression and anxiety Social and relationship problems Although there's no sure way to prevent eating disorders, here are some strategies to help your child develop healthy-eating behaviors: Family dining habits may influence the relationships children develop with food.	general
Eating meals together gives you an opportunity to teach your child about the pitfalls of dieting and encourages eating a balanced diet in reasonable portions.	general
Avoid dieting around your child.	general
For example, there are numerous websites that promote dangerous ideas, such as viewing anorexia as a lifestyle choice rather than an eating disorder.	general
It's crucial to correct any misperceptions like this and to talk to your child about the risks of unhealthy eating choices.	general
Talk to your child.	general
in your child, whatever his or her shape or size.	general
Talk to your child about self-image and offer reassurance that body shapes can vary.	general
Avoid criticizing your own body in front of your child.	general
Messages of acceptance and respect can help build healthy self-esteem and resilience that will carry children through the rocky periods of the teen years.	general
Cultivate and reinforce a healthy body image At well-child visits, doctors may be able to identify early indicators of an eating disorder.	general
They can ask children questions about their eating habits and satisfaction with their appearance during routine medical appointments, for instance.	general
These visits should include checks of height and weight percentiles and body mass index, which can alert you and your child's doctor to any significant changes.	general
Enlist the help of your child's doctor.	general
If you notice a family member or friend who seems to show signs of an eating disorder, consider talking to that person about your concern for his or her well-being.	general
Although you may not be able to prevent an eating disorder from developing, reaching out with compassion may encourage the person to seek treatment.	general
Ebola virus and Marburg virus are related viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers ‚Äî illnesses marked by severe bleeding (hemorrhage), organ failure and, in many cases, death.	general
Both viruses are native to Africa, where sporadic outbreaks have occurred for decades.	general
Ebola virus and Marburg virus live in animal hosts, and humans can contract the viruses from infected animals.	general
After the initial transmission, the viruses can spread from person to person through contact with body fluids or contaminated needles.	general
No drug has been approved to treat either virus.	general
People diagnosed with Ebola or Marburg virus receive supportive care and treatment for complications.	general
Scientists are coming closer to developing vaccines for these deadly diseases.	general
Signs and symptoms typically begin abruptly within five to 10 days of infection with Ebola or Marburg virus.	general
Early signs and symptoms include: Nausea and vomiting Bleeding, usually from the eyes, and when close to death, possible bleeding from the ears, nose and rectum Internal bleeding Ebola virus has been found in African monkeys, chimps and other nonhuman primates.	general
A milder strain of Ebola has been discovered in monkeys and pigs in the Philippines.	general
Marburg virus has been found in monkeys, chimps and fruit bats in Africa.	general
Transmission from animals to humans Experts suspect that both viruses are transmitted to humans through an infected animal's bodily fluids.	general
Examples include: Butchering or eating infected animals can spread the viruses.	general
Scientists who have operated on infected animals as part of their research have also contracted the virus.	general
Tourists in certain African caves and some underground mine workers have been infected with the Marburg virus, possibly through contact with the feces or urine of infected bats.	general
Waste products.	general
Transmission from person to person Infected people typically don't become contagious until they develop symptoms.	general
Family members are often infected as they care for sick relatives or prepare the dead for burial.	general
Medical personnel can be infected if they don't use protective gear, such as surgical masks and gloves.	general
There's no evidence that Ebola virus or Marburg virus can be spread via insect bites.	general
More Information Risk factors For most people, the risk of getting Ebola hemorrhagic fever or Marburg hemorrhagic fever is low.	general
The risk increases if you: You're at increased risk if you visit or work in areas where Ebola virus or Marburg virus outbreaks have occurred.	general
Travel to Africa.	general
People are more likely to contract the Ebola or Marburg virus if they conduct animal research with monkeys imported from Africa or the Philippines.	general
Conduct animal research.	general
Family members are often infected as they care for sick relatives.	general
Medical personnel also can be infected if they don't use protective gear, such as surgical masks and gloves.	general
Provide medical or personal care.	general
The bodies of people who have died of Ebola or Marburg hemorrhagic fever are still contagious.	general
Helping prepare these bodies for burial can increase your risk of developing the disease.	general
Prepare people for burial.	general
Complications Both Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers lead to death for a high percentage of people who are affected.	general
As the illness progresses, it can cause: Multiple organ failure One reason the viruses are so deadly is that they interfere with the immune system's ability to mount a defense.	general
But scientists don't understand why some people recover from Ebola and Marburg and others don't.	general
For people who survive, recovery is slow.	general
It may take months to regain weight and strength, and the viruses remain in the body for weeks.	general
People may experience: Sensory changes Prevention focuses on avoiding contact with the viruses.	general
The following precautions can help prevent infection and spread of Ebola and Marburg.	general
Before traveling to Africa, find out about current epidemics by checking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.	general
Avoid areas of known outbreaks.	general
As with other infectious diseases, one of the most important preventive measures is frequent hand-washing.	general
Use soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand rubs containing at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water aren't available.	general
Wash your hands frequently.	general
In developing countries, avoid buying or eating the wild animals, including nonhuman primates, sold in local markets.	general
Avoid bush meat.	general
In particular, caregivers should avoid contact with an infected person's body fluids and tissues, including blood, semen, vaginal secretions and saliva.	general
People with Ebola or Marburg are most contagious in the later stages of the disease.	general
Avoid contact with infected people.	general
If you're a health care worker, wear protective clothing, such as gloves, masks, gowns and eye shields.	general
Keep infected people isolated from others.	general
Dispose of needles and sterilize other instruments.	general
Follow infection-control procedures.	general
The bodies of people who have died of Ebola or Marburg disease are still contagious.	general
Specially organized and trained teams should bury the remains, using appropriate safety equipment.	general
Don't handle remains.	general
Vaccine development Scientists are working on a variety of vaccines that would protect people from Ebola and Marburg viruses.	general
Some of the results have been promising, but further testing is needed.	general
Ebstein anomaly Ebstein anomaly Ebstein anomaly is a rare heart defect in which the tricuspid valve ‚Äî the valve between the upper right chamber (right atrium) and the lower right chamber (right ventricle) of the heart ‚Äî doesn't work properly.	general
As a result, blood leaks back through the valve and into the right atrium.	general
Atrial septal defect is a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart.	general
About half the people with Ebstein anomaly have an atrial septal defect.	general
Ebstein anomaly is a rare heart defect that's present at birth (congenital).	general
In Ebstein anomaly, your tricuspid valve ‚Äî the valve between the two right heart chambers (right atrium and right ventricle) ‚Äî doesn't work properly.	general
The tricuspid valve sits lower than normal in the right ventricle, and the tricuspid valve's leaflets are abnormally formed.	general
Blood may leak back through the valve, making your heart work less efficiently.	general
Ebstein anomaly may also lead to enlargement of the heart or heart failure.	general
If you have no signs or symptoms associated with Ebstein anomaly, careful monitoring of your heart may be all that's necessary.	general
If signs and symptoms bother you, or if the heart is enlarging or becoming weaker, treatment for Ebstein anomaly may be necessary.	general
Treatment options include medications and surgery.	general
Ebstein Anomaly Mild forms of Ebstein anomaly may not cause symptoms until later in adulthood.	general
If signs and symptoms are present, they may include: Shortness of breath, especially with exertion Heart palpitations or abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) A bluish discoloration of the lips and skin caused by low oxygen (cyanosis) When to see a doctor If you or your child has signs or symptoms of heart failure ‚Äî such as feeling easily fatigued or short of breath, even with normal activity ‚Äî or is showing blue skin coloration around the lips and nails (cyanosis), talk to your doctor.	general
He or she may refer you to a doctor who specializes in congenital heart disease (cardiologist).	general
Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers.	general
The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood.	general
The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart.	general
The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.	general
Ebstein anomaly is a heart defect that you have at birth (congenital).	general
Why it occurs is still unknown.	general
To understand how Ebstein anomaly affects your heart, it helps to know a little about how the heart works to supply your body with blood.	general
How your heart works Your heart is made up of four chambers.	general
The two upper chambers (atria) receive blood.	general
The two lower chambers (ventricles) pump blood.	general
Four valves open and close to let blood flow in one direction through the heart.	general
Each valve consists of two or three strong, thin flaps (leaflets) of tissue.	general
When closed, a valve prevents blood from flowing to the next chamber or from returning to the previous chamber.	general
Oxygen-poor blood returns from your body and flows into the right atrium.	general
Blood then flows through the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to your lungs to receive oxygen.	general
On the other side of your heart, oxygen-rich blood from your lungs flows into the left atrium, through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle, which then pumps the blood to the rest of your body.	general
What happens in Ebstein anomaly In Ebstein anomaly, the tricuspid valve sits lower than normal in the right ventricle.	general
This makes it so that a portion of the right ventricle becomes part of the right atrium (becomes atrialized), causing the right atrium to be larger than usual.	general
Because of this, the right ventricle can't work properly.	general
Also, the tricuspid valve's leaflets are abnormally formed.	general
This can lead to blood leaking backward into the right atrium (tricuspid valve regurgitation).	general
The placement of the valve and how poorly it's formed may vary among people.	general
Some people may have a mildly abnormal valve.	general
Others may have a valve that is extremely displaced, and it may leak severely.	general
The more the tricuspid valve leaks, the more the right atrium enlarges as it receives more blood.	general
At the same time, the right ventricle enlarges (dilates) as it tries to cope with the leaky valve and still deliver blood to the lungs.	general
Thus, the right-sided chambers of the heart enlarge, and as they do, they weaken, which may lead to heart failure.	general
Other heart conditions associated with Ebstein anomaly Several other heart conditions may be associated with Ebstein anomaly.	general
A few common conditions include: Many people with Ebstein anomaly have a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart called an atrial septal defect or a small flap-like opening called a patent foramen ovale (PFO).	general
A PFO is a hole between the upper heart chambers that is present in all babies before birth but usually closes after birth, although it may remain open in some people without causing issues.	general
Holes in the heart.	general
These holes may allow oxygen-poor blood in the right atrium to mix with oxygen-rich blood in the left atrium, decreasing the amount of oxygen available in your blood.	general
This causes a bluish discoloration of the lips and skin (cyanosis).	general
Some people with Ebstein anomaly have an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid heartbeats (tachycardia).	general
Abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias).	general
These types of arrhythmias can make your heart work less effectively, especially when the tricuspid valve is leaking severely.	general
In some cases, a very fast heart rhythm may cause fainting spells (syncope).	general
Some people with Ebstein anomaly may also have a condition known as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome ‚Äî an abnormal electrical pathway in the heart.	general
The presence of WPW syndrome can lead to very fast heart rates and fainting spells.	general
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.	general
Risk factors Congenital heart defects, such as Ebstein anomaly, happen early in the development of a baby's heart.	general
It's uncertain what risk factors might cause the defect.	general
Genetic and environmental factors are both thought to play a role.	general
People with a family history of heart defects may be more likely to have Ebstein anomaly.	general
A mother's exposure to certain medications, such as lithium, may be associated with Ebstein anomaly in the child.	general
Complications Many people with mild Ebstein anomaly have few complications.	general
However, you may need to take some precautions in certain situations: If you have mild Ebstein anomaly with a nearly normal heart size and no heart rhythm disturbances, you can probably participate in most physical activities.	general
Being active.	general
Depending on your signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend that you avoid certain competitive sports, such as football or basketball.	general
Your doctor can help you decide which activities are right for you.	general
In many cases, women with mild Ebstein anomaly can safely have children.	general
But pregnancy does have risks.	general
During pregnancy.	general
If you plan on becoming pregnant, be sure to talk to your doctor ahead of time.	general
He or she can tell you if it's safe for you to become pregnant and help decide how much extra monitoring you may need throughout pregnancy and childbirth.	general
He or she may also suggest other treatments for your condition or symptoms before you become pregnant.	general
Being pregnant puts additional strain on your heart and circulatory system not only during pregnancy, but also during labor and delivery.	general
However, vaginal delivery may be possible.	general
Rarely, severe complications can develop that can cause death to the mother or baby.	general
Other complications that may result from Ebstein anomaly include heart failure, heart rhythm problems and, less commonly, sudden cardiac arrest or stroke.	general
Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra heartbeats that begin in one of your heart's two lower pumping chambers (ventricles).	general
These extra beats disrupt your regular heart rhythm, sometimes causing you to feel a fluttering or a skipped beat in your chest.	general
Premature ventricular contractions are common ‚Äî they occur in many people.	general
They're also called: Premature ventricular complexes Ventricular premature beats Ventricular extrasystoles If you have occasional premature ventricular contractions, but you're otherwise healthy, there's probably no reason for concern, and no need for treatment.	general
If you have frequent premature ventricular contractions or underlying heart disease, you might need treatment.	general
Premature ventricular contractions often cause few or no symptoms.	general
But you might feel an odd sensation in your chest, such as: Skipped beats or missed beats Increased awareness of your heartbeat When to see a doctor If you feel fluttering, a sensation of skipped heartbeats or odd feelings in your chest, talk to your doctor.	general
You'll want to identify the source of these symptoms, whether it's PVCs, other heart rhythm problems, serious heart problems, anxiety, anemia or infections.	general
Normal heartbeat Normal heartbeat In a normal heart rhythm, a tiny cluster of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal.	general
The signal then travels through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node and then passes into the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump out blood.	general
Your heart is made up of four chambers ‚Äî two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).	general
The rhythm of your heart is normally controlled by the sinoatrial (SA) node ‚Äî or sinus node ‚Äî an area of specialized cells in the right atrium.	general
This natural pacemaker produces the electrical impulses that trigger the normal heartbeat.	general
From the sinus node, electrical impulses travel across the atria to the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood to your lungs and body.	general
PVCs are abnormal contractions that begin in the ventricles.	general
These extra contractions usually beat sooner than the next expected regular heartbeat.	general
And they often interrupt the normal order of pumping, which is the atria first, then the ventricles.	general
Why do extra beats occur?	general
The reasons aren't always clear.	general
Certain triggers, heart diseases or changes in the body can make cells in the ventricles electrically unstable.	general
Heart disease or scarring may also cause electrical impulses to be misrouted.	general
Premature ventricular contractions can be associated with: Certain medications, including decongestants and antihistamines Alcohol or illegal drugs Increased levels of adrenaline in the body that may be caused by caffeine, tobacco, exercise or anxiety Injury to the heart muscle from coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, high blood pressure or heart failure Risk factors Caffeine , tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs Exercise ‚Äî if you have certain types of PVCs High blood pressure (hypertension) Complications Having frequent PVCs or certain patterns of them might increase your risk of developing heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) or weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).	general
Rarely, when accompanied by heart disease, frequent premature contractions can lead to chaotic, dangerous heart rhythms and possibly sudden cardiac death.	general
Normal and ectopic pregnancy Normal and ectopic pregnancy In a healthy pregnancy, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus.	general
In an ectopic pregnancy, the egg attaches itself somewhere outside the uterus ‚Äî usually to the inside of the fallopian tube.	general
An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the main cavity of the uterus.	general
Pregnancy begins with a fertilized egg.	general
Normally, the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus.	general
An ectopic pregnancy most often occurs in a fallopian tube, which carries eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.	general
This type of ectopic pregnancy is called a tubal pregnancy.	general
Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in other areas of the body, such as the ovary, abdominal cavity or the lower part of the uterus (cervix), which connects to the vagina.	general
An ectopic pregnancy can't proceed normally.	general
The fertilized egg can't survive, and the growing tissue may cause life-threatening bleeding, if left untreated.	general
Products & Services You may not notice anything at first.	general
However, some women with an ectopic pregnancy have the usual early signs or symptoms of pregnancy ‚Äî a missed period, breast tenderness and nausea.	general
If you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive.	general
Still, an ectopic pregnancy can't continue as normal.	general
Signs and symptoms increase as the fertilized egg grows in the improper place.	general
Early warning of ectopic pregnancy Often, the first warning sign of an ectopic pregnancy is pelvic pain.	general
Light vaginal bleeding may also occur.	general
If blood leaks from the fallopian tube, you may feel increasing abdominal pain, an urge to have a bowel movement or pelvic discomfort.	general
If heavy bleeding (hemorrhaging) occurs, you may feel shoulder pain as blood fills your pelvis and abdomen.	general
Your specific symptoms depend on where the blood collects and which nerves are irritated.	general
Emergency symptoms If the fertilized egg continues to grow in the fallopian tube, it can cause the tube to rupture.	general
Heavy bleeding inside the abdomen is likely.	general
Symptoms of this life-threatening event include extreme lightheadedness, fainting, severe abdominal pain and shock.	general
When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical help if you have any signs or symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including: Severe abdominal or pelvic pain during pregnancy Abnormal vaginal bleeding Extreme lightheadedness or fainting Other concerning symptoms, especially if you have risk factors for an ectopic pregnancy A tubal pregnancy ‚Äî the most common type of ectopic pregnancy ‚Äî happens when a fertilized egg gets stuck on its way to the uterus, often because the fallopian tube is damaged by inflammation or is misshapen.	general
Hormonal imbalances or abnormal development of the fertilized egg also might play a role.	general
Risk factors Some things that make you more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy are: If you've had this type of pregnancy before, you're more likely to have another.	general
Previous ectopic pregnancy.	general
Sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, can cause inflammation in the tubes and other nearby organs, and increase your risk of an ectopic pregnancy.	general
Inflammation or infection.	general
Some research suggests that women who have in vitro fertilization (IVF) or similar treatments are more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy.	general
Infertility itself may also raise your risk.	general
Fertility treatments.	general
Surgery to correct a closed or damaged fallopian tube can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy.	general
Tubal surgery.	general
The chance of getting pregnant while using an intrauterine device (IUD) is rare.	general
However, if you do get pregnant with an IUD in place, it's more likely to be ectopic.	general
"Tubal ligation, a permanent method of birth control commonly known as ""having your tubes tied,"" also raises your risk, if you become pregnant after this procedure."	general
Choice of birth control.	general
Cigarette smoking just before you get pregnant can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy.	general
The more you smoke, the greater the risk.	general
Complications An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst open.	general
Without treatment, the ruptured tube can lead to life-threatening bleeding.	general
There's no way to prevent an ectopic pregnancy, but here are some ways to decrease your risk: Limit your number of sexual partners.	general
Always use a condom during sex to help prevent sexually transmitted infections and reduce your risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.	general
Don't smoke.	general
If you do, quit before you try to get pregnant.	general
In ectropion, the lower lid sags away from the eye.	general
Because of the sagging lid, your eye can't close completely when you blink, which can cause the eye to be dry and irritated.	general
Ectropion (ek-TROH-pee-on) is a condition in which your eyelid turns outward.	general
This leaves the inner eyelid surface exposed and prone to irritation.	general
Ectropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid.	general
In severe ectropion, the entire length of the eyelid is turned out.	general
In less severe ectropion, only one segment of the eyelid sags away from the eye.	general
Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of ectropion.	general
But usually surgery is needed to fully correct the condition.	general
Normally when you blink, your eyelids distribute tears evenly across your eyes, keeping the surfaces of the eyes lubricated.	general
These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids (puncta).	general
If you have ectropion, your lower lid pulls away from your eye and tears don't drain properly into the puncta.	general
The resulting signs and symptoms can include: Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids.	general
Watery eyes (excessive tearing).	general
Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy.	general
Excessive dryness.	general
Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes.	general
Irritation.	general
Stagnant tears or dry eyes can irritate the surface of the cornea, making you sensitive to light.	general
Sensitivity to light.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if your eyes are constantly watering or irritated, or your eyelid seems to be sagging or drooping.	general
Seek immediate care if you have been diagnosed with ectropion and you experience: Rapidly increasing redness in your eyes Sensitivity to light Decreasing vision These are signs and symptoms of cornea exposure or ulcers, which can harm your vision.	general
Ectropion can be caused by: As you age, the muscles under your eyes tend to weaken, and tendons stretch out.	general
These muscles and tendons hold your eyelid taut against your eye.	general
When they weaken, your eyelid can begin to droop.	general
Muscle weakness.	general
Certain conditions, such as Bell's palsy, and certain types of tumors can paralyze facial nerves and muscles.	general
Facial paralysis that affects eyelid muscles can lead to ectropion.	general
Facial paralysis.	general
Skin that has been damaged by burns or trauma, such as a dog bite, can affect the way that your eyelid rests against your eye.	general
Previous eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) can cause ectropion, particularly if a considerable amount of skin was removed from the eyelid at the time of surgery.	general
Scars or previous surgeries.	general
Benign or cancerous growths on your eyelid can cause the lid to turn outward.	general
Eyelid growths.	general
Rarely is ectropion present at birth (congenital).	general
When it is, it's usually associated with genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.	general
Genetic disorders.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing ectropion include: The most common cause of ectropion is weakening muscle tissue associated with aging.	general
People who have had eyelid surgery are at higher risk of developing ectropion later.	general
Previous eye surgeries.	general
If you've had spots of skin cancer on your face, facial burns or trauma, you're at higher risk of developing ectropion.	general
Previous cancer, burns or trauma.	general
Complications Ectropion leaves your cornea irritated and exposed, making it more susceptible to drying.	general
The result can be abrasions and ulcers on the cornea, which can threaten your vision.	general
Flaccid and erect penis Flaccid and erect penis The penis contains two cylindrical, spongelike structures (corpora cavernosa).	general
When a male becomes sexually aroused, nerve impulses increase blood flow to both cylinders.	general
This sudden influx of blood causes an erection by expanding, straightening and stiffening the penis.	general
Erectile dysfunction (impotence) is the inability to get and keep an erection firm enough for sex.	general
Having erection trouble from time to time isn't necessarily a cause for concern.	general
If erectile dysfunction is an ongoing issue, however, it can cause stress, affect your self-confidence and contribute to relationship problems.	general
Problems getting or keeping an erection can also be a sign of an underlying health condition that needs treatment and a risk factor for heart disease.	general
If you're concerned about erectile dysfunction, talk to your doctor ‚Äî even if you're embarrassed.	general
Sometimes, treating an underlying condition is enough to reverse erectile dysfunction.	general
In other cases, medications or other direct treatments might be needed.	general
Trouble getting an erection Trouble keeping an erection When to see a doctor A family doctor is a good place to start when you have erectile problems.	general
See your doctor if: You have concerns about your erections or you're experiencing other sexual problems such as premature or delayed ejaculation You have diabetes, heart disease or another known health condition that might be linked to erectile dysfunction You have other symptoms along with erectile dysfunction Male sexual arousal is a complex process that involves the brain, hormones, emotions, nerves, muscles and blood vessels.	general
Erectile dysfunction can result from a problem with any of these.	general
Likewise, stress and mental health concerns can cause or worsen erectile dysfunction.	general
Sometimes a combination of physical and psychological issues causes erectile dysfunction.	general
For instance, a minor physical condition that slows your sexual response might cause anxiety about maintaining an erection.	general
The resulting anxiety can lead to or worsen erectile dysfunction.	general
Physical causes of erectile dysfunction In many cases, erectile dysfunction is caused by something physical.	general
Common causes include: Heart disease Metabolic syndrome ‚Äî a condition involving increased blood pressure, high insulin levels, body fat around the waist and high cholesterol Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse Sleep disorders Treatments for prostate cancer or enlarged prostate Surgeries or injuries that affect the pelvic area or spinal cord Psychological causes of erectile dysfunction The brain plays a key role in triggering the series of physical events that cause an erection, starting with feelings of sexual excitement.	general
A number of things can interfere with sexual feelings and cause or worsen erectile dysfunction.	general
These include: Depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions Relationship problems due to stress, poor communication or other concerns Risk factors As you get older, erections might take longer to develop and might not be as firm.	general
You might need more direct touch to your penis to get and keep an erection.	general
Various risk factors can contribute to erectile dysfunction, including: particularly diabetes or heart conditions Medical conditions, which restricts blood flow to veins and arteries, can ‚Äî over time ‚Äî cause chronic health conditions that lead to erectile dysfunction Tobacco use, especially if you're obese Being overweight, such as prostate surgery or radiation treatment for cancer Certain medical treatments, particularly if they damage the nerves or arteries that control erections including antidepressants, antihistamines and medications to treat high blood pressure, pain or prostate conditions Medications, such as stress, anxiety or depression Psychological conditions, especially if you're a long-term drug user or heavy drinker Drug and alcohol use, Complications An unsatisfactory sex life More Information The best way to prevent erectile dysfunction is to make healthy lifestyle choices and to manage any existing health conditions.	general
For example: Work with your doctor to manage diabetes, heart disease or other chronic health conditions.	general
See your doctor for regular checkups and medical screening tests.	general
Stop smoking, limit or avoid alcohol, and don't use illegal drugs.	general
Exercise regularly.	general
Get help for anxiety, depression or other mental health concerns.	general
Edema is swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in your body's tissues.	general
Although edema can affect any part of your body, you may notice it more in your hands, arms, feet, ankles and legs.	general
Edema can be the result of medication, pregnancy or an underlying disease ‚Äî often congestive heart failure, kidney disease or cirrhosis of the liver.	general
Taking medication to remove excess fluid and reducing the amount of salt in your food often relieves edema.	general
When edema is a sign of an underlying disease, the disease itself requires separate treatment.	general
Edema in foot and ankle Edema in foot and ankle Swelling of the foot, ankle and leg can be severe enough to leave an indentation (pit) when you press on the area.	general
This swelling (edema) is the result of excess fluid in your tissues ‚Äî often caused by congestive heart failure or blockage in a leg vein.	general
Signs of edema include: Swelling or puffiness of the tissue directly under your skin, especially in your legs or arms Stretched or shiny skin Skin that retains a dimple (pits), after being pressed for several seconds Increased abdominal size When to see a doctor Make an appointment to see your doctor if you have swelling, stretched or shiny skin, or skin that retains a dimple after being pressed (pitting).	general
See your doctor immediately if you experience: Shortness of breath Difficulty breathing These can be signs of pulmonary edema, which requires prompt treatment.	general
If you've been sitting for a prolonged period, such as on a long flight, and you develop leg pain and swelling that won't go away, call your doctor.	general
Persistent leg pain and swelling can indicate a blood clot deep in your vein (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT).	general
Edema occurs when tiny blood vessels in your body (capillaries) leak fluid.	general
The fluid builds up in surrounding tissues, leading to swelling.	general
Mild cases of edema may result from: Sitting or staying in one position for too long Eating too much salty food Having premenstrual signs and symptoms Being pregnant Edema can also be a side effect of some medications, including: High blood pressure medications Certain diabetes medications called thiazolidinediones In some cases, however, edema may be a sign of a more serious underlying medical condition.	general
Several diseases and conditions may cause edema, including: If you have congestive heart failure, one or both of your heart's lower chambers lose their ability to pump blood effectively.	general
As a result, blood can back up in your legs, ankles and feet, causing edema.	general
Congestive heart failure can also cause swelling in your abdomen.	general
Sometimes, this condition can cause fluid to accumulate in your lungs (pulmonary edema), which can lead to shortness of breath.	general
Congestive heart failure.	general
Fluid may accumulate in your abdominal cavity (ascites) and in your legs as a result of liver damage (cirrhosis).	general
When you have kidney disease, extra fluid and sodium in your circulation may cause edema.	general
The edema associated with kidney disease usually occurs in your legs and around your eyes.	general
Kidney disease.	general
Damage to the tiny, filtering blood vessels in your kidneys can result in nephrotic syndrome.	general
In nephrotic syndrome, declining levels of protein (albumin) in your blood can lead to fluid accumulation and edema.	general
Kidney damage.	general
If you have chronic venous insufficiency, the one-way valves in your leg veins are weakened or damaged, which allows blood to pool in your leg veins and causes swelling.	general
Sudden onset of swelling in one leg accompanied by pain in your calf muscle can be due to a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT) in one of your leg veins.	general
If this occurs, seek medical help immediately.	general
Weakness or damage to veins in your legs.	general
Your body's lymphatic system helps clear excess fluid from tissues.	general
If this system is damaged ‚Äî for example, by cancer surgery ‚Äî the lymph nodes and lymph vessels draining an area may not work correctly, and edema can occur.	general
Inadequate lymphatic system.	general
An extreme lack (deficiency), of protein in your diet over a long period of time can lead to fluid accumulation and edema.	general
Severe, long-term protein deficiency.	general
Risk factors If you are pregnant, your body retains more sodium and water than usual due to the fluid needed by the fetus and placenta.	general
This can increase your risk of developing edema.	general
Your risk of edema may be increased if you take certain medications, including: High blood pressure medications Certain diabetes medications called thiazolidinediones A chronic illness ‚Äî such as congestive heart failure or liver or kidney disease ‚Äî can increase your risk of edema.	general
Also, surgery can sometimes obstruct a lymph node, leading to swelling in an arm or leg, usually on just one side.	general
Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs.	general
This fluid collects in the numerous air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.	general
In most cases, heart problems cause pulmonary edema.	general
But fluid can accumulate for other reasons, including pneumonia, exposure to certain toxins and medications, trauma to the chest wall, and visiting or exercising at high elevations.	general
Pulmonary edema that develops suddenly (acute pulmonary edema) is a medical emergency requiring immediate care.	general
Pulmonary edema can sometimes be fatal, but the outlook improves if you get treated quickly.	general
Treatment for pulmonary edema varies depending on the cause but generally includes supplemental oxygen and medications.	general
Depending on the cause, pulmonary edema signs and symptoms may appear suddenly or develop over time.	general
Sudden (acute) pulmonary edema signs and symptoms Extreme shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (dyspnea) that worsens with activity or when lying down A feeling of suffocating or drowning that worsens when lying down Wheezing or gasping for breath Cold, clammy skin Anxiety, restlessness or a sense of apprehension A cough that produces frothy sputum that may be tinged with blood Blue-tinged lips Long-term (chronic) pulmonary edema signs and symptoms More shortness of breath than normal when you're physically active Difficulty breathing with exertion Awakening at night with a cough or breathless feeling that may be relieved by sitting up Rapid weight gain High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) signs and symptoms HAPE can occur when people travel to or exercise at very high altitudes.	general
Signs and symptoms are similar to those that occur with acute pulmonary edema and include: Shortness of breath after exertion, which progresses to shortness of breath at rest Difficulty walking uphill, which progresses to difficulty walking on flat surfaces A cough that produces frothy sputum that may be tinged with blood A rapid, irregular heartbeat (palpitations) Chest discomfort When to see a doctor Pulmonary edema that comes on suddenly (acute pulmonary edema) is life-threatening.	general
Call 911 or emergency medical assistance if you have any of the following acute signs and symptoms: Shortness of breath, especially if it comes on suddenly Trouble breathing or a feeling of suffocating (dyspnea) A bubbly, wheezing or gasping sound when you breathe Pink, frothy sputum when you cough Breathing difficulty along with profuse sweating A blue or gray tone to your skin A significant drop in blood pressure resulting in lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness or sweating A sudden worsening of any of the symptoms associated with chronic pulmonary edema or high-altitude pulmonary edema Don't attempt to drive yourself to the hospital.	general
Instead, call 911 or emergency medical care and wait for help.	general
Your lungs contain numerous small, elastic air sacs called alveoli.	general
With each breath, these air sacs take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.	general
Normally, the exchange of gases takes place without problems.	general
But in certain circumstances, the alveoli fill with fluid instead of air, preventing oxygen from being absorbed into your bloodstream.	general
A number of things can cause fluid to accumulate in your lungs, but most have to do with your heart (cardiogenic pulmonary edema).	general
Understanding the relationship between your heart and lungs can help explain why.	general
How your heart works Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers.	general
The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood.	general
The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart.	general
The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.	general
Your heart is composed of two upper and two lower chambers.	general
The upper chambers (the right and left atria) receive incoming blood and pump it into the lower chambers.	general
The lower chambers (the more muscular right and left ventricles) pump blood out of your heart.	general
The heart valves ‚Äî which keep blood flowing in the correct direction ‚Äî are gates at the chamber openings.	general
Normally, deoxygenated blood from all over your body enters the right atrium and flows into the right ventricle, where it's pumped through large blood vessels (pulmonary arteries) to your lungs.	general
There, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen.	general
The oxygen-rich blood then returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins, flows through the mitral valve into the left ventricle and finally leaves your heart through another large artery, the aorta.	general
The aortic valve at the base of the aorta keeps the blood from flowing backward into your heart.	general
From the aorta, the blood travels to the rest of your body.	general
Heart-related (cardiogenic) pulmonary edema Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a type of pulmonary edema caused by increased pressures in the heart.	general
This condition usually occurs when the diseased or overworked left ventricle isn't able to pump out enough of the blood it receives from your lungs (congestive heart failure).	general
As a result, pressure increases inside the left atrium and then in the veins and capillaries in your lungs, causing fluid to be pushed through the capillary walls into the air sacs.	general
Medical conditions that can cause the left ventricle to become weak and eventually fail include: Over time, the arteries that supply blood to your heart muscle can become narrow from fatty deposits (plaques).	general
A heart attack occurs when a blood clot forms in one of these narrowed arteries, blocking blood flow and damaging the portion of your heart muscle supplied by that artery.	general
The result is that the damaged heart muscle can no longer pump as well as it should.	general
Coronary artery disease.	general
Sometimes, a clot isn't the cause of the problem.	general
Instead, gradual narrowing of the coronary arteries can lead to weakness of the left ventricular muscle.	general
Although the rest of your heart tries to compensate for this loss, there are times when it's unable to do so effectively.	general
The heart can also be weakened by the extra workload.	general
When the pumping action of your heart is weakened, blood gradually backs up into your lungs, forcing fluid in your blood to pass through the capillary walls into the air sacs.	general
This is chronic congestive heart failure.	general
When your heart muscle is damaged, the condition is called cardiomyopathy.	general
Because cardiomyopathy affects the function of the ventricles ‚Äî your heart's main pump ‚Äî your heart may not be able to respond to conditions that require it to work harder, such as a surge in blood pressure, a faster heartbeat with exertion, or consuming too much salt in the diet that causes water retention or infections.	general
When the left ventricle can't keep up with the demands that are placed on it, fluid backs up into your lungs.	general
Cardiomyopathy.	general
In mitral valve disease or aortic valve disease, the valves that regulate blood flow in the left side of your heart may not open wide enough (stenosis).	general
Or, they don't close completely, allowing blood to flow backward through the valve (insufficiency or regurgitation).	general
Heart valve problems.	general
When the valves are narrowed, blood can't flow freely into your heart and pressure in the left ventricle builds up, causing the left ventricle to work harder and harder with each contraction.	general
The left ventricle also dilates to allow greater blood flow, but this makes the left ventricle's pumping action less efficient.	general
The increased pressure extends into the left atrium and then to the pulmonary veins, causing fluid to accumulate in your lungs.	general
On the other hand, if the mitral valve leaks, some blood is backwashed toward your lung each time your heart pumps.	general
If the leakage develops suddenly, you may develop sudden and severe pulmonary edema.	general
Untreated or uncontrolled high blood pressure can enlarge the heart.	general
High blood pressure (hypertension).	general
Other conditions may lead to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, such as high blood pressure due to narrowed kidney arteries (renal artery stenosis) and fluid buildup due to kidney disease or heart problems.	general
Non-heart-related (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema High-altitude pulmonary edema High-altitude pulmonary edema In normal lungs, air sacs (alveoli) take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.	general
In high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), it's theorized that vessels in the lungs constrict, causing increased pressure.	general
This causes fluid to leak from the blood vessels to the lung tissues and eventually into the air sacs.	general
Pulmonary edema that isn't caused by increased pressures in your heart is called noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.	general
In this condition, fluid may leak from the capillaries in your lungs' air sacs because the capillaries themselves become more permeable or leaky, even without the buildup of back pressure from your heart.	general
Some factors that can cause noncardiogenic pulmonary edema include: This serious disorder occurs when your lungs suddenly fill with fluid and inflammatory white blood cells.	general
Many conditions can cause ARDS, including severe injuries (trauma), systemic infection (sepsis), pneumonia and severe bleeding.	general
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	general
Mountain climbers and people who travel to high-altitude locations run the risk of developing high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).	general
High altitudes.	general
This condition ‚Äî which generally occurs at elevations above 8,000 feet (about 2,400 meters) ‚Äî can also affect hikers or skiers who start exercising at higher altitudes without first becoming acclimated, which can take from a few days to a week or so.	general
But even people who have hiked or skied at high altitudes in the past aren't immune.	general
Although the exact cause isn't completely understood, HAPE seems to develop as a result of increased pressure from constriction of the pulmonary capillaries.	general
Without appropriate care, HAPE can be fatal, but this risk can be minimized.	general
A type of pulmonary edema called neurogenic pulmonary edema can occur after some nervous system conditions or procedures ‚Äî such as after a head injury or seizure ‚Äî or after brain surgery.	general
Nervous system conditions.	general
Many drugs ‚Äî ranging from illegal drugs such as heroin and cocaine to aspirin ‚Äî are known to cause noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.	general
Adverse drug reaction.	general
Pulmonary edema can develop after a blockage in the upper airway causes negative pressure in the lungs from intense efforts to breathe despite the blockage.	general
Negative pressure pulmonary edema.	general
Pulmonary embolism, a condition that occurs when blood clots travel from blood vessels in your legs to your lungs, can lead to pulmonary edema.	general
Pulmonary embolism.	general
Pulmonary edema can be caused by viral infections such as the hantavirus and dengue virus.	general
Viral infections.	general
These include toxins you inhale as well as those that may circulate within your own body, for example, if you inhale (aspirate) some of your stomach contents when you vomit.	general
Inhaling toxins causes intense irritation of the small airways and alveoli, resulting in fluid accumulation.	general
Exposure to certain toxins.	general
Smoke from a fire contains chemicals that damage the membrane between the air sacs and the capillaries, allowing fluid to enter your lungs.	general
Smoke inhalation.	general
Inhaling water causes noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that is reversible with immediate attention.	general
Near drowning.	general
Complications If pulmonary edema continues, it can raise pressure in the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), and eventually the right ventricle in your heart becomes weak and begins to fail.	general
The right ventricle has a much thinner wall of muscle than does the left side of your heart because it is under less pressure to pump blood into the lungs.	general
The increased pressure backs up into the right atrium and then into various parts of your body, where it can cause: Lower extremity and abdominal swelling Buildup of fluid in the membranes that surround your lungs (pleural effusion) Congestion and swelling of the liver Left untreated, acute pulmonary edema can be deadly.	general
In some instances, it may be fatal even if you receive treatment.	general
Preventing conditions and situations that cause pulmonary edema can help keep pulmonary edema from developing.	general
These measures can help reduce your risk.	general
Preventing cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of pulmonary edema.	general
You can reduce your risk of many kinds of heart problems by following these suggestions: High blood pressure (hypertension) can lead to serious conditions such as a stroke, cardiovascular disease and kidney failure.	general
In many cases, you can lower your blood pressure or maintain a healthy level by getting regular exercise; maintaining a healthy weight; eating a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products; and limiting salt and alcohol.	general
Control your blood pressure.	general
Cholesterol is one of several types of fats essential to good health.	general
But too much cholesterol can be too much of a good thing.	general
Higher than normal cholesterol levels can cause fatty deposits to form in your arteries, impeding blood flow and increasing your risk of vascular disease.	general
Watch your blood cholesterol.	general
But lifestyle changes can often keep your cholesterol levels low.	general
Lifestyle changes may include limiting fats (especially saturated fats); eating more fiber, fish, and fresh fruits and vegetables; exercising regularly; stopping smoking; and drinking in moderation.	general
If you smoke and can't quit on your own, talk to your doctor about strategies or programs to help you break a smoking habit.	general
Smoking can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.	general
Also avoid secondhand smoke.	general
Don't smoke.	general
Eat a healthy diet that's low in salt, sugars and solid fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.	general
Eat a heart-healthy diet.	general
It's especially important to use less salt (sodium) if you have heart disease or high blood pressure.	general
In some people with severely damaged left ventricular function, excess salt may be enough to trigger congestive heart failure.	general
Limit salt.	general
If you're having a hard time cutting back on salt, it may help to talk to a dietitian.	general
He or she can help point out low-sodium foods as well as offer tips for making a low-salt diet interesting and good tasting.	general
Exercise is vital for a healthy heart.	general
Regular aerobic exercise, about 30 minutes a day, helps you control blood pressure and cholesterol levels and maintain a healthy weight.	general
If you're not used to exercise, start out slowly and build up gradually.	general
Be sure to get your doctor's OK before starting an exercise program.	general
Exercise regularly.	general
Being even slightly overweight increases your risk of cardiovascular disease.	general
On the other hand, even losing small amounts of weight can lower your blood pressure and cholesterol and reduce your risk of diabetes.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
To reduce your risk of heart problems, try to reduce your stress levels.	general
Find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life.	general
Manage stress.	general
Preventing high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) If you travel or climb at high altitudes, acclimate yourself slowly.	general
Although recommendations vary, most experts advise ascending no more than 1,000 to 1,200 feet (about 305 to 366 meters) a day once you reach 8,200 feet (about 2,500 meters).	general
Some climbers take prescription medications such as acetazolamide or nifedipine (Procardia) to help prevent signs and symptoms of HAPE.	general
To prevent HAPE, start taking the medication at least one day before ascent.	general
Continue taking the medication for about five days after you've arrived at your high-altitude destination.	general
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited disorders that affect your connective tissues ‚Äî primarily your skin, joints and blood vessel walls.	general
Connective tissue is a complex mixture of proteins and other substances that provide strength and elasticity to the underlying structures in your body.	general
People who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome usually have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin.	general
This can become a problem if you have a wound that requires stitches, because the skin often isn't strong enough to hold them.	general
A more severe form of the disorder, called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type, can cause the walls of your blood vessels, intestines or uterus to rupture.	general
Because Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type, can have serious potential complications in pregnancy, you may want to talk to a genetic counselor before starting a family.	general
Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Signs and symptoms of the most common form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome include: Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion.	general
Joint pain and dislocations are common.	general
Overly flexible joints.	general
Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual.	general
You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go.	general
Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety.	general
Stretchy skin.	general
Damaged skin often doesn't heal well.	general
For example, the stitches used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar.	general
These scars may look thin and crinkly.	general
Fragile skin.	general
Symptom severity can vary from person to person.	general
Some people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome will have overly flexible joints, but few or none of the skin symptoms.	general
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type People who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type, often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes.	general
They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily.	general
In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin.	general
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type, can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body.	general
A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal.	general
The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines ‚Äî which also may rupture.	general
Different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with a variety of genetic causes, some of which are inherited and passed on from parent to child.	general
If you have the most common varieties of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50 percent chance that you'll pass on the gene to each of your children.	general
Complications Complications depend on the types of signs and symptoms you have.	general
For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis.	general
Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring.	general
People who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type, are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels.	general
Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture.	general
Pregnancy can increase these risks.	general
If you have a personal or family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and you're thinking about starting a family, you may benefit from talking to a genetic counselor ‚Äî a health care professional trained to assess the risk of inherited disorders.	general
Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children.	general
Eisenmenger syndrome Eisenmenger syndrome Eisenmenger syndrome is most often a complication of having a hole (shunt) between two chambers of your heart.	general
Here, a hole between the heart's main pumping chambers (ventricular septal defect) causes increased blood flow to the pulmonary arteries.	general
Eventually the shunt irreparably damages the walls of your lung's arteries (pulmonary arteries).	general
Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when the pressure in the pulmonary arteries becomes so high that it causes oxygen-poor (blue) blood to flow from the right to left ventricle and then to the body, causing cyanosis.	general
The high pressure also causes the wall of your heart's right ventricle to thicken (hypertrophy).	general
Eisenmenger (I-sun-meng-uhr) syndrome is a complication of a heart defect that you're born with (congenital).	general
A heart defect that causes a hole (shunt) to develop between two chambers of your heart is the most common cause of Eisenmenger syndrome.	general
This hole causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart and lungs.	general
Increased blood flow returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body.	general
The blood vessels in your lung arteries become stiff and narrow, increasing the pressure in your lungs' arteries.	general
This permanently damages the blood vessels in your lungs.	general
Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when the increased pressure of the blood flow in the lung becomes so great that the direction of blood flow through the shunt reverses.	general
Oxygen-poor (blue) blood from the right side of the heart flows into the left side of the heart and is pumped to your body so you don't receive enough oxygen to all your organs and tissues.	general
Eisenmenger syndrome is a life-threatening condition requiring careful medical monitoring.	general
Medications can improve symptoms and prognosis.	general
Easily tiring and shortness of breath with activity Shortness of breath while at rest Chest pain or tightness Fainting (syncope) When to see a doctor If you have any signs or symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome, make an appointment to see your doctor.	general
Even if you haven't previously been diagnosed with a heart defect, symptoms such as cyanosis and shortness of breath are signals that you have a health problem that needs medical attention.	general
Eisenmenger syndrome develops most often due to a hole between the chambers of your heart.	general
To understand how Eisenmenger syndrome affects your heart and lungs, it's helpful to know how your heart works.	general
How the heart works Your heart is divided into four chambers, two on the right and two on the left.	general
In performing its basic job ‚Äî pumping blood throughout your body ‚Äî your heart uses its left and right sides for different tasks.	general
The right side moves blood into vessels that lead to your lungs.	general
In your lungs, oxygen enriches your blood, which circulates to your heart's left side.	general
The left side of your heart pumps blood into a large vessel called the aorta, which circulates blood to the rest of your body.	general
Valves control the flow of blood into and out of the chambers of your heart.	general
These valves open to allow blood to move to the next chamber or to one of the arteries, and they close to keep blood from flowing backward.	general
How Eisenmenger syndrome develops For most people who have Eisenmenger syndrome, the cause of their condition is due to a hole (shunt) between the main blood vessels or chambers of your heart.	general
This shunt is a heart defect you're born with (congenital).	general
Heart defects that can cause Eisenmenger syndrome include: This shunt in the wall of tissue that divides the right and left sides of your heart's main pumping chambers (ventricles) is the most common cause of Eisenmenger syndrome.	general
Ventricular septal defect.	general
An atrial septal defect is a shunt in the wall of tissue that divides the right and left sides of the upper chambers of your heart (atria).	general
Atrial septal defect.	general
This heart defect is an opening between the pulmonary artery that carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs and the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body (aorta).	general
Patent ductus arteriosus.	general
In this heart defect, there's a large hole in the center of the heart where the walls between the upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles) meet.	general
Some of the valves in your heart also may not function properly.	general
Atrioventricular canal defect.	general
For each of these defects, the increased pressure of blood flowing through the shunt increases the pressure in your pulmonary artery.	general
Over time, this increased pressure damages the smaller blood vessels in your lungs.	general
Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when blood flows backward through the shunt, causing oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix.	general
This lowers the oxygen level in your blood (cyanosis), and your red blood cell count increases to try to make up for the lack of oxygen.	general
Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when a congenital heart defect is not treated or detected early enough to be closed before damage to the lung arteries occurs.	general
If you or your child receives a diagnosis of a heart defect, it's important to start treatment promptly, including having surgeries or procedures to help correct the defect.	general
A family history of heart defects also increases the risk of a baby being born with a congenital heart defect, including the possibility of developing Eisenmenger syndrome.	general
Talk to your doctor about screening other family members for heart defects if you've been diagnosed with a heart defect or Eisenmenger syndrome.	general
Complications Regular medical treatment and monitoring is important to manage complications of Eisenmenger syndrome, including: The reversed blood flow through your heart lowers the amount of oxygen your body's tissues and organs receive.	general
This causes you to have a lower tolerance for physical activity and your skin to have a bluish or a grayish color.	general
Low oxygen levels in your blood (cyanosis).	general
Because you aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood circulating throughout your body, your kidneys release a hormone that increases your number of red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen throughout your body.	general
High red blood cell count (erythrocytosis).	general
Having too many red blood cells can reduce the blood flow to other organs and increase your risk of developing blood clots.	general
Enlargement and thickening of the walls in the heart, along with low oxygen levels, may cause an irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia).	general
Arrhythmias.	general
Some types of arrhythmias can cause blood to pool in your heart's chambers, where it can clot.	general
If the clot travels out of your heart and blocks an artery, you can have a stroke, heart attack or clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).	general
If you develop an arrhythmia as a complication of Eisenmenger syndrome, it's possible the arrhythmia could suddenly stop your heartbeat.	general
Sudden cardiac arrest.	general
Cardiac arrest is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness.	general
Without immediate medical attention, you can die of sudden cardiac arrest in minutes.	general
You can also go into cardiac arrest during or after surgical procedures, usually related to changes in blood pressure caused by anesthesia.	general
The increased pressure in your heart can cause your heart muscles to weaken, decreasing your heart's pumping effectiveness.	general
Eventually, this can lead to heart failure.	general
Heart failure.	general
Increased pressure in the lungs and problems with your blood caused by Eisenmenger syndrome can cause life-threatening bleeding into your lungs and airways, causing you to cough up blood and further lowering your blood oxygen level.	general
Bleeding can also occur in other parts of the body.	general
Coughing up blood (hemoptysis).	general
Stroke can occur when a blood clot travels from your heart to your brain.	general
This blood clot may then block a blood vessel in the brain, leading to a stroke.	general
The high levels of red blood cells in Eisenmenger syndrome also increase your risk of blood clots and stroke.	general
Low oxygen levels in your blood may lead to problems with your kidneys.	general
This can also increase your risk of developing gout.	general
Kidney problems.	general
Due to the demands pregnancy puts on a mother's heart and lungs, women who have Eisenmenger syndrome shouldn't become pregnant.	general
If you have Eisenmenger syndrome, pregnancy poses a high risk of death for both you and your baby.	general
Pregnancy risks.	general
Eisenmenger syndrome is a life-threatening condition.	general
The prognosis for people diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome depends on the type of congenital heart defect and other medical conditions.	general
People who are diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome can survive as long as age 60 and sometimes longer.	general
Elevated blood pressure means your blood pressure is slightly above normal.	general
It will likely turn into high blood pressure (hypertension) unless you make lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise and eating healthier foods.	general
Both elevated blood pressure and high blood pressure increase your risk of a heart attack, stroke and heart failure.	general
Weight loss, exercise and other healthy lifestyle changes can often control elevated blood pressure, and set the stage for a lifetime of better health.	general
Elevated blood pressure doesn't cause symptoms.	general
The only way to detect it is to keep track of your blood pressure readings.	general
Have your blood pressure checked at each doctor's visit ‚Äî or check it at home with a home blood pressure monitoring device.	general
When to see a doctor All people age 3 and older should have their blood pressure checked by a doctor at least once a year.	general
You might need more-frequent readings if you have elevated blood pressure or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.	general
Any factor that increases pressure against the artery walls can lead to elevated blood pressure.	general
The buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries (atherosclerosis) can lead to high blood pressure.	general
Besides atherosclerosis, other conditions that can lead to elevated blood pressure or high blood pressure include: Obstructive sleep apnea Kidney disease Adrenal disease Thyroid disease Certain medications ‚Äî including birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs ‚Äî also can cause blood pressure to rise temporarily.	general
Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can have the same effect.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for elevated blood pressure include: The greater your body mass, the more blood you need to supply oxygen and nutrients to your tissues.	general
As the amount of blood going through your blood vessels increases, so does the force on your artery walls.	general
Being overweight or obese.	general
Younger adults are more likely to have elevated blood pressure than are older adults because the risk of hypertension increases as you age.	general
So many older adults have progressed beyond elevated blood pressure to hypertension.	general
Even children can develop elevated blood pressure, especially if they're overweight or obese.	general
High blood pressure is more common in men than in women through about age 55.	general
Women are more likely to develop high blood pressure after age 55.	general
High blood pressure is particularly common among people of African heritage, often developing at an earlier age than it does in white people.	general
If a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, has high blood pressure, you're more likely to develop the condition.	general
Family history of high blood pressure.	general
Not exercising can increase your risk of high blood pressure and increase your risk of being overweight.	general
Not being physically active.	general
Sodium and potassium are two key nutrients in the way your body regulates your blood pressure.	general
If you have too much sodium or too little potassium in your diet, you're more likely to have high blood pressure.	general
Diet high in salt (sodium) or low in potassium.	general
Smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco or being around others who smoke (secondhand smoke) can increase your blood pressure.	general
Tobacco use.	general
Alcohol use has been associated with increased blood pressure, particularly in men.	general
Drinking too much alcohol.	general
Kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea, among others, can increase the risk of elevated blood pressure.	general
Certain chronic conditions.	general
Although elevated blood pressure and high blood pressure are most common in adults, children can be at risk, too.	general
For some children, kidney or heart problems can cause high blood pressure.	general
But for a growing number of kids, poor lifestyle habits, such as an unhealthy diet, obesity and lack of exercise, contribute to elevated blood pressure and high blood pressure.	general
Complications Elevated blood pressure is likely to worsen and develop into hypertension.	general
Hypertension can damage your organs and increase the risk of several conditions including a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, aneurysms and kidney failure.	general
The same healthy lifestyle changes recommended to treat elevated blood pressure also help prevent hypertension.	general
You've heard it before ‚Äî eat healthy foods, use less salt, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, drink less alcohol, manage stress and quit smoking.	general
But take the advice to heart.	general
Start adopting healthier habits today.	general
Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot gets lodged in an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow to part of the lung.	general
Blood clots most often originate in the legs and travel up through the right side of the heart and into the lungs.	general
Pulmonary embolism is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in your lungs.	general
In most cases, pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from the legs or, rarely, other parts of the body (deep vein thrombosis).	general
Because the clots block blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening.	general
However, prompt treatment greatly reduces the risk of death.	general
Taking measures to prevent blood clots in your legs will help protect you against pulmonary embolism.	general
Pulmonary embolism symptoms can vary greatly, depending on how much of your lung is involved, the size of the clots, and whether you have underlying lung or heart disease.	general
Common signs and symptoms include: This symptom typically appears suddenly and always gets worse with exertion.	general
Shortness of breath.	general
You may feel like you're having a heart attack.	general
The pain may become worse when you breathe deeply (pleurisy), cough, eat, bend or stoop.	general
The pain will get worse with exertion but won't go away when you rest.	general
Chest pain.	general
The cough may produce bloody or blood-streaked sputum.	general
Other signs and symptoms that can occur with pulmonary embolism include: Leg pain or swelling, or both, usually in the calf Clammy or discolored skin (cyanosis) When to see a doctor Pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if you experience unexplained shortness of breath, chest pain or a cough that produces bloody sputum.	general
Pulmonary embolism occurs when a clump of material, most often a blood clot, gets wedged into an artery in your lungs.	general
These blood clots most commonly come from the deep veins of your legs.	general
This condition is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).	general
In most cases, multiple clots are involved but not necessarily all at once.	general
The portions of lung served by each blocked artery are robbed of blood and may die.	general
This is known as pulmonary infarction.	general
This makes it more difficult for your lungs to provide oxygen to the rest of your body.	general
Occasionally, blockages in the blood vessels are caused by substances other than blood clots, such as: Fat from the marrow of a broken long bone Collagen or other tissue Part of a tumor Blood clot in leg vein Blood clot in leg vein A blood clot in a leg vein may cause pain, warmth and tenderness in the affected area.	general
Although anyone can develop blood clots and subsequent pulmonary embolism, certain factors can increase your risk.	general
Medical history You're at higher risk if you or any of your family members have had venous blood clots or pulmonary embolism in the past.	general
This may be due to inherited disorders that affect blood, making it more prone to clot.	general
In addition, some medical conditions and treatments put you at risk, such as: Cardiovascular disease, specifically heart failure, makes clot formation more likely.	general
Heart disease.	general
Certain cancers ‚Äî especially pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancers, and many cancers with metastasis ‚Äî can increase levels of substances that help blood clot, and chemotherapy further increases the risk.	general
Women with a personal or family history of breast cancer who are taking tamoxifen or raloxifene also are at higher risk of blood clots.	general
Surgery is one of the leading causes of problem blood clots.	general
For this reason, medication to prevent clots may be given before and after major surgery such as joint replacement.	general
Prolonged immobility Blood clots are more likely to form during periods of inactivity, such as: Being confined to bed for an extended period after surgery, a heart attack, leg fracture, trauma or any serious illness makes you more vulnerable to blood clots.	general
When the lower extremities are horizontal for long periods, the flow of venous blood slows and blood can pool in the legs.	general
Sitting in a cramped position during lengthy plane or car trips slows blood flow in the legs, which contributes to the formation of clots.	general
Long trips.	general
Other risk factors For reasons that aren't well-understood, tobacco use predisposes some people to blood clot formation, especially when combined with other risk factors.	general
Excess weight increases the risk of blood clots ‚Äî particularly in women who smoke or have high blood pressure.	general
Being overweight.	general
The estrogen in birth control pills and in hormone replacement therapy can increase clotting factors in your blood, especially if you smoke or are overweight.	general
Supplemental estrogen.	general
The weight of the baby pressing on veins in the pelvis can slow blood return from the legs.	general
Clots are more likely to form when blood slows or pools.	general
Complications Pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening.	general
About one-third of people with undiagnosed and untreated pulmonary embolism don't survive.	general
When the condition is diagnosed and treated promptly, however, that number drops dramatically.	general
Pulmonary embolism can also lead to pulmonary hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure in your lungs and in the right side of the heart is too high.	general
When you have obstructions in the arteries inside your lungs, your heart must work harder to push blood through those vessels.	general
This increases the blood pressure within these vessels and the right side of the heart, which can weaken your heart.	general
In rare cases, small emboli occur frequently and develop over time, resulting in chronic pulmonary hypertension, also known as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.	general
Preventing clots in the deep veins in your legs (deep vein thrombosis) will help prevent pulmonary embolism.	general
For this reason, most hospitals are aggressive about taking measures to prevent blood clots, including: These medications are often given to people at risk of clots before and after an operation ‚Äî as well as to people admitted to the hospital with a heart attack, stroke or complications of cancer.	general
Blood thinners (anticoagulants).	general
Compression stockings steadily squeeze your legs, helping your veins and leg muscles move blood more efficiently.	general
They offer a safe, simple and inexpensive way to keep blood from stagnating during and after general surgery.	general
Compression stockings.	general
Elevating your legs when possible and during the night also can be very effective Raise the bottom of your bed 4 to 6 inches with blocks or books.	general
Leg elevation.	general
Moving as soon as possible after surgery can help prevent pulmonary embolism and hasten recovery overall.	general
This is one of the main reasons your nurse may push you to get up, even on your day of surgery, and walk despite pain at the site of your surgical incision.	general
Physical activity.	general
This treatment uses thigh-high or calf-high cuffs that automatically inflate with air and deflate every few minutes to massage and squeeze the veins in your legs and improve blood flow.	general
Pneumatic compression.	general
Prevention while traveling The risk of blood clots developing while traveling is low, but increases as travel increases.	general
If you have risk factors for blood clots and you're concerned about traveling, talk with your doctor.	general
Your doctor might suggest the following to help prevent blood clots during travel: Water is the best liquid for preventing dehydration, which can contribute to the development of blood clots.	general
Avoid alcohol, which contributes to fluid loss.	general
Drink plenty of fluids.	general
Move around the airplane cabin once an hour or so.	general
If you're driving, stop every hour and walk around the car a couple of times.	general
Do a few deep knee bends.	general
Take a break from sitting.	general
Flex your ankles every 15 to 30 minutes.	general
Fidget in your seat.	general
Your doctor may recommend these to help promote circulation and fluid movement in your legs.	general
Compression stockings are available in a range of stylish colors and textures.	general
There are even devices, called stocking butlers, to help you put on the stockings.	general
Wear support stockings.	general

Embryonal tumors Embryonal tumors of the central nervous system are cancerous (malignant) tumors that start in the fetal (embryonic) cells in the brain.	general
Embryonal tumors can occur at any age, but most often occur in babies and young children.	general
Types of embryonal tumors include: The most common type of embryonal tumor, these fast-growing cancerous brain tumors start in the lower back part of the brain, called the cerebellum.	general
The cerebellum is involved in muscle coordination, balance and movement.	general
Medulloblastomas tend to spread through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to other areas around the brain and spinal cord, though they rarely spread to other areas of the body.	general
Medulloblastomas.	general
Rare tumors that are cancerous, ETMRs typically occur in infants and young children.	general
These aggressive tumors most often start in the largest part of the brain, called the cerebrum, which controls thinking and voluntary movement.	general
ETMRs can also occur in other parts of the brain and are often characterized by a certain genetic change.	general
Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMRs).	general
These rare, fast-growing cancerous tumors typically occur in the brain or spinal cord of infants and young children.	general
Medulloepitheliomas.	general
These rare, cancerous tumors are most often found in the cerebellum of infants and children under 3 years of age.	general
Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.	general
A category called embryonal tumors not otherwise specified includes most cancerous tumors that were formerly called primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), occurring in the brain and spinal cord.	general
Other embryonal tumors.	general
Signs and symptoms of embryonal tumors vary, depending on the type of tumor, location, severity and other factors, such as pressure buildup within the brain.	general
Symptoms may include, for example, headaches, nausea, vomiting, unusual tiredness, dizziness, double vision, unsteady walk, seizures or other issues.	general
The process of diagnosis usually starts with a medical history review and a discussion of signs and symptoms.	general
Tests and procedures used to diagnose embryonal tumors include those below, but additional tests may be needed to find out if the cancer has spread.	general
During this procedure, vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes are tested.	general
This helps determine which part of the brain might be affected by the tumor.	general
Neurological exam.	general
Imaging tests can help determine the location and size of the brain tumor.	general
These tests are also very important to identify pressure or blockage of the CSF pathways.	general
A computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done right away.	general
These tests are often used to diagnose brain tumors.	general
Advanced techniques, such as perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, also may be used.	general
Imaging tests.	general
A biopsy is usually not done before the tumor is surgically removed, but it may be recommended if the imaging features aren't typical of embryonal tumors.	general
The sample of suspicious tissue is analyzed in a lab to determine the types of cells.	general
Removal of tissue for testing (biopsy).	general
Also called a spinal tap, this procedure involves inserting a needle between two bones in the lower spine to draw out cerebrospinal fluid from around the spinal cord.	general
The fluid is tested to look for tumor cells or other abnormalities.	general
This test is only done after managing the pressure in the brain or removing the tumor.	general
Removal of cerebrospinal fluid for testing (lumbar puncture).	general
Treatment for embryonal tumors depends on the patient's age (typically babies and young children), tumor type and location, tumor grade and extent, and other factors.	general
Options include: Some embryonal tumors may grow to block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which can cause a buildup of fluid that puts pressure on the brain (hydrocephalus).	general
).	general
Surgery to create a pathway for the fluid to flow out of the brain (external ventricular drain or ventriculoperitoneal shunt) may be recommended.	general
Sometimes this procedure can be combined with surgery to remove the tumor.	general
Surgery to relieve fluid buildup in the brain.	general
A pediatric brain surgeon (neurosurgeon) removes as much of the tumor as possible, taking care not to harm nearby tissue.	general
Typically, all children with embryonal tumors should receive additional treatments after surgery to target any remaining cells.	general
Surgery to remove the tumor.	general
A pediatric radiation oncologist administers radiation therapy to the brain and spinal cord using high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells.	general
Standard radiation therapy can be used, but proton beam therapy ‚Äî available at a limited number of major health care centers in the United States ‚Äî delivers higher targeted doses of radiation to brain tumors, minimizing radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissue.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill tumor cells.	general
Typically, children with embryonal tumors receive these drugs as an injection into the vein (intravenous chemotherapy).	general
Chemotherapy may be recommended after surgery or radiation therapy, or in certain cases, at the same time as radiation therapy.	general
In some cases, high dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell rescue (a stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells) may be used.	general
Chemotherapy.	general
Clinical trials enroll eligible participants to study the effectiveness of new treatments or to study new ways of using existing treatments, such as different combinations or timing of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.	general
These studies provide a chance to try the latest treatment options, though the risk of side effects may not be known.	general
Talk with your doctor for advice.	general
Clinical trials.	general
To ensure correct diagnosis and treatment, children with embryonal tumors need to be seen at a center that has a team of pediatric specialists with expertise and experience in pediatric brain tumors, with access to the latest technology and treatments for children.	general
Emphysema damages the inner walls of the lungs' air sacs (alveoli), causing them to eventually rupture.	general
This creates one larger air space instead of many small ones and reduces the surface area available for gas exchange.	general
Emphysema is a lung condition that causes shortness of breath.	general
In people with emphysema, the air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) are damaged.	general
Over time, the inner walls of the air sacs weaken and rupture ‚Äî creating larger air spaces instead of many small ones.	general
This reduces the surface area of the lungs and, in turn, the amount of oxygen that reaches your bloodstream.	general
When you exhale, the damaged alveoli don't work properly and old air becomes trapped, leaving no room for fresh, oxygen-rich air to enter.	general
Most people with emphysema also have chronic bronchitis.	general
Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the tubes that carry air to your lungs (bronchial tubes), which leads to a persistent cough.	general
Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are two conditions that make up chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).	general
Smoking is the leading cause of COPD.	general
Treatment may slow the progression of COPD, but it can't reverse the damage.	general
You can have emphysema for many years without noticing any signs or symptoms.	general
The main symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath, which usually begins gradually.	general
You may start avoiding activities that cause you to be short of breath, so the symptom doesn't become a problem until it starts interfering with daily tasks.	general
Emphysema eventually causes shortness of breath even while you're at rest.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you've had unexplained shortness of breath for several months, especially if it's getting worse or it's interfering with your daily activities.	general
Don't ignore it by telling yourself it's because you're aging or out of shape.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if: You're so short of breath, you can't climb stairs Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray with exertion You're not mentally alert The main cause of emphysema is long-term exposure to airborne irritants, including: Tobacco smoke Marijuana smoke Air pollution Chemical fumes and dust Rarely, emphysema is caused by an inherited deficiency of a protein that protects the elastic structures in the lungs.	general
It's called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency emphysema.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing emphysema include: Emphysema is most likely to develop in cigarette smokers, but cigar and pipe smokers also are susceptible.	general
The risk for all types of smokers increases with the number of years and amount of tobacco smoked.	general
Although the lung damage that occurs in emphysema develops gradually, most people with tobacco-related emphysema begin to experience symptoms of the disease between the ages of 40 and 60.	general
Secondhand smoke, also known as passive or environmental tobacco smoke, is smoke that you inadvertently inhale from someone else's cigarette, pipe or cigar.	general
Being around secondhand smoke increases your risk of emphysema.	general
Exposure to secondhand smoke.	general
If you breathe fumes from certain chemicals or dust from grain, cotton, wood or mining products, you're more likely to develop emphysema.	general
This risk is even greater if you smoke.	general
Occupational exposure to fumes or dust.	general
Breathing indoor pollutants, such as fumes from heating fuel, as well as outdoor pollutants ‚Äî car exhaust, for instance ‚Äî increases your risk of emphysema.	general
Exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution.	general
Complications People who have emphysema are also more likely to develop: A collapsed lung can be life-threatening in people who have severe emphysema, because the function of their lungs is already so compromised.	general
This is uncommon but serious when it occurs.	general
Collapsed lung (pneumothorax).	general
Emphysema can increase the pressure in the arteries that connect the heart and lungs.	general
This can cause a condition called cor pulmonale, in which a section of the heart expands and weakens.	general
Heart problems.	general
Some people with emphysema develop empty spaces in the lungs called bullae.	general
They can be as large as half the lung.	general
In addition to reducing the amount of space available for the lung to expand, giant bullae can increase your risk of pneumothorax.	general
Large holes in the lungs (bullae).	general
More Information To prevent emphysema, don't smoke and avoid breathing secondhand smoke.	general
Wear a mask to protect your lungs if you work with chemical fumes or dust.	general
Encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is inflammation of the brain.	general
There are several causes, but the most common is viral infection.	general
Encephalitis often causes only mild flu-like signs and symptoms ‚Äî such as a fever or headache ‚Äî or no symptoms at all.	general
Sometimes the flu-like symptoms are more severe.	general
Encephalitis can also cause confused thinking, seizures, or problems with senses or movement.	general
Rarely, encephalitis can be life-threatening.	general
Timely diagnosis and treatment are important because it's difficult to predict how encephalitis will affect each individual.	general
Bulging fontanel Bulging fontanel One of the major signs of encephalitis in infants is bulging of the soft spots (fontanels) of the baby's skull.	general
Pictured here is the anterior fontanel.	general
Other fontanels are found on the sides and back of an infant's head.	general
Most people with viral encephalitis have mild flu-like symptoms, such as: Fatigue or weakness Sometimes the signs and symptoms are more severe, and might include: Confusion, agitation or hallucinations Loss of sensation or paralysis in certain areas of the face or body Muscle weakness Loss of consciousness In infants and young children, signs and symptoms might also include: Bulging in the soft spots (fontanels) of an infant's skull Nausea and vomiting Irritability When to see a doctor Get immediate care if you are experiencing any of the more-severe symptoms associated with encephalitis.	general
Severe headache, fever and altered consciousness require urgent care.	general
Infants and young children with any signs or symptoms of encephalitis should receive urgent care.	general
The exact cause of encephalitis is often unknown.	general
But when a cause is known, the most common is a viral infection.	general
Bacterial infections and noninfectious inflammatory conditions also can cause encephalitis.	general
There are two main types of encephalitis: This condition occurs when a virus or other agent directly infects the brain.	general
The infection may be concentrated in one area or widespread.	general
A primary infection may be a reactivation of a virus that had been inactive after a previous illness.	general
Primary encephalitis.	general
This condition results from a faulty immune system reaction to an infection elsewhere in the body.	general
Instead of attacking only the cells causing the infection, the immune system also mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the brain.	general
Also known as post-infection encephalitis, secondary encephalitis often occurs two to three weeks after the initial infection.	general
Secondary encephalitis.	general
West Nile virus transmission cycle West Nile virus transmission cycle When a mosquito bites an infected bird, the virus enters the mosquito's bloodstream and eventually moves into its salivary glands.	general
When an infected mosquito bites an animal or a human (host), the virus is passed into the host's bloodstream, where it may cause serious illness.	general
Common viral causes The viruses that can cause encephalitis include: Both HSV type 1 ‚Äî associated with cold sores and fever blisters around your mouth ‚Äî and HSV type 2 ‚Äî associated with genital herpes ‚Äî can cause encephalitis.	general
Encephalitis caused by HSV type 1 is rare but can result in significant brain damage or death.	general
Herpes simplex virus (HSV).	general
These include the Epstein-Barr virus, which commonly causes infectious mononucleosis, and the varicella-zoster virus, which commonly causes chickenpox and shingles.	general
Other herpes viruses.	general
These viruses include the poliovirus and the coxsackievirus, which usually cause an illness with flu-like symptoms, eye inflammation and abdominal pain.	general
Enteroviruses.	general
These viruses can cause infections such as West Nile, La Crosse, St. Louis, western equine and eastern equine encephalitis.	general
Symptoms of an infection might appear within a few days to a couple of weeks after exposure to a mosquito-borne virus.	general
Mosquito-borne viruses.	general
The Powassan virus is carried by ticks and causes encephalitis in the Midwestern United States.	general
Symptoms usually appear about a week after a bite from an infected tick.	general
Tick-borne viruses.	general
Infection with the rabies virus, which is usually transmitted by a bite from an infected animal, causes a rapid progression to encephalitis once symptoms begin.	general
Rabies is a rare cause of encephalitis in the United States.	general
Rabies virus.	general
Common childhood infections ‚Äî such as measles (rubeola), mumps and German measles (rubella) ‚Äî used to be fairly common causes of secondary encephalitis.	general
These causes are now rare in the United States due to the availability of vaccinations for these diseases.	general
Childhood infections.	general
Risk factors Anyone can develop encephalitis.	general
Factors that may increase the risk include: Some types of encephalitis are more common or more severe in certain age groups.	general
In general, young children and older adults are at greater risk of most types of viral encephalitis.	general
People who have HIV/AIDS, take immune-suppressing drugs or have another condition causing a weakened immune system are at increased risk of encephalitis.	general
Weakened immune system.	general
Mosquito- or tick-borne viruses are common in particular geographical regions.	general
Geographical regions.	general
Mosquito- and tick-borne diseases tend to be more common in summer in many areas of the United States.	general
Season of the year.	general
Complications The complications of encephalitis vary, depending on factors such as: The severity of your initial illness The time from disease onset to treatment People with relatively mild illness usually recover within a few weeks with no long-term complications.	general
Complications of severe illness Inflammation can injure the brain, possibly resulting in coma or death.	general
Other complications ‚Äî varying greatly in severity ‚Äî may persist for months or be permanent.	general
These complications can include: Persistent fatigue Personality changes Memory problems The best way to prevent viral encephalitis is to take precautions to avoid exposure to viruses that can cause the disease.	general
Try to: Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before and after meals.	general
Practice good hygiene.	general
Don't share tableware and beverages.	general
Don't share utensils.	general
Make sure they practice good hygiene and avoid sharing utensils at home and school.	general
Teach your children good habits.	general
Keep your own and your children's vaccinations current.	general
Before traveling, talk to your doctor about recommended vaccinations for different destinations.	general
Get vaccinations.	general
Protection against mosquitoes and ticks To minimize your exposure to mosquitoes and ticks: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if you're outside between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active, and when you're in a wooded area with tall grasses and shrubs where ticks are more common.	general
Dress to protect yourself.	general
Chemicals such as DEET can be applied to both the skin and clothes.	general
To apply repellent to your face, spray it on your hands and then wipe it on your face.	general
If you're using both sunscreen and a repellent, apply sunscreen first.	general
Apply mosquito repellent.	general
The Environmental Protection Agency recommends the use of products containing permethrin, which repels and kills ticks and mosquitoes.	general
These products can be sprayed on clothing, tents and other outdoor gear.	general
Permethrin shouldn't be applied to the skin.	general
Use insecticide.	general
Refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes are most common.	general
If possible, avoid being outdoors from dusk till dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.	general
Repair broken windows and screens.	general
Avoid mosquitoes.	general
Eliminate standing water in your yard, where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.	general
Common problems include flowerpots or other gardening containers, flat roofs, old tires and clogged gutters.	general
Get rid of water sources outside your home.	general
If you notice sick or dying birds or animals, report your observations to your local health department.	general
Look for outdoor signs of viral disease.	general
Protection for young children Insect repellents aren't recommended for use on infants younger than 2 months of age.	general
Instead, cover an infant carrier or stroller with mosquito netting.	general
For older infants and children, repellents with 10 to 30 percent DEET are considered safe.	general
Products containing both DEET and sunscreen aren't recommended for children because reapplication ‚Äî which might be necessary for the sunscreen component ‚Äî will expose the child to too much DEET.	general
Tips for using mosquito repellent with children include: Always assist children with the use of mosquito repellent.	general
Spray on clothing and exposed skin.	general
Apply the repellent when outdoors to lessen the risk of inhaling the repellent.	general
Spray repellent on your hands and then apply it to your child's face.	general
Take care around the eyes and ears.	general
Don't use repellent on the hands of young children who may put their hands in their mouths.	general
Wash treated skin with soap and water when you come indoors.	general
Encopresis (en-ko-PREE-sis), sometimes called fecal incontinence or soiling, is the repeated passing of stool (usually involuntarily) into clothing.	general
Typically it happens when impacted stool collects in the colon and rectum: the colon becomes too full and liquid stool leaks around the retained stool, staining underwear.	general
Eventually, stool retention can cause swelling (distention) of the bowels and loss of control over bowel movements.	general
Encopresis usually occurs after age 4, when a child has already learned to use a toilet.	general
In most cases, soiling is a symptom of chronic constipation.	general
Far less frequently it occurs without constipation and may be the result of emotional issues.	general
Encopresis can be frustrating for parents ‚Äî and embarrassing for the child.	general
However, with patience and positive reinforcement, treatment for encopresis is usually successful.	general
Signs and symptoms of encopresis may include: Leakage of stool or liquid stool on underwear, which can be mistaken for diarrhea Constipation with dry, hard stool Passage of large stool that clogs or almost clogs the toilet Avoidance of bowel movements Lack of appetite Repeated bladder infections, typically in girls When to see a doctor Call your doctor if your child is already toilet trained and starts experiencing one or more of the symptoms listed above.	general
There are several causes of encopresis, including constipation and emotional issues.	general
Constipation Most cases of encopresis are the result of chronic constipation.	general
In constipation, the child's stool is hard, dry and may be painful to pass.	general
As a result, the child avoids going to the toilet ‚Äî making the problem worse.	general
The longer the stool remains in the colon, the more difficult it is for the child to push stool out.	general
The colon stretches, ultimately affecting the nerves that signal when it's time to go to the toilet.	general
When the colon becomes too full, soft or liquid stool may leak out around the retained stool or loss of control over bowel movements may occur.	general
Some causes of constipation include: Withholding stool due to fear of using the toilet (especially when away from home) or because stools are painful Not wanting to interrupt play or other activities Eating too little fiber Not drinking enough fluids Drinking too much cow's milk or, rarely, an intolerance to cow's milk ‚Äî though research results conflict on these issues Emotional issues Emotional stress may trigger encopresis.	general
A child may experience stress from: Premature, difficult or conflict-filled toilet training Changes in the child's life, such as dietary changes, toilet training, starting school or schedule changes Emotional stressors, for example, the divorce of a parent or the birth of a sibling Risk factors Encopresis is more common in boys.	general
These risk factors may increase the chances of having encopresis: Using medications that may cause constipation, such as cough suppressants Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Autism spectrum disorder Anxiety or depression Complications A child who has encopresis may experience a range of emotions, including embarrassment, frustration, shame and anger.	general
If your child is teased by friends or criticized or punished by adults, he or she may feel depressed or have low self-esteem.	general
Below are some strategies that can help prevent encopresis and its complications.	general
Avoid constipation Help your child avoid constipation by providing a balanced diet that's high in fiber and encouraging your child to drink enough water.	general
Learn about effective toilet training techniques Educate yourself on effective toilet training techniques.	general
Avoid starting too early or being too forceful in your methods.	general
Wait until your child is ready, and then use positive reinforcement and encouragement to help make progress.	general
Ask your doctor about resources on toilet training.	general
Get early treatment for encopresis Early treatment, including guidance from your child's doctor or mental health professional, can help prevent the social and emotional impact of encopresis.	general
Regular follow-up visits with your doctor can help identify ongoing or recurring problems so that adjustments in treatment can be made as needed.	general
Endocarditis Endocarditis Endocarditis occurs when bacteria enter your bloodstream, travel to your heart, and lodge on abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue.	general
Abnormal growths (vegetations) that contain collections of bacteria may form in your heart at the site of the infection and damage the heart valves, which can cause them to leak.	general
Endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, which is the inner lining of your heart chambers and heart valves.	general
Endocarditis generally occurs when bacteria, fungi or other germs from another part of your body, such as your mouth, spread through your bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in your heart.	general
If it's not treated quickly, endocarditis can damage or destroy your heart valves and can lead to life-threatening complications.	general
Treatments for endocarditis include antibiotics and, in certain cases, surgery.	general
Since there are many ways to develop endocarditis, your doctor might not be able to pinpoint the exact cause of your condition.	general
However, people at greatest risk of endocarditis usually have damaged heart valves, artificial heart valves or other heart defects.	general
Endocarditis may develop slowly or suddenly, depending on what germs are causing the infection and whether you have any underlying heart problems.	general
Endocarditis signs and symptoms can vary from person to person.	general
Common signs and symptoms of endocarditis include: Flu-like symptoms, such as fever and chills A new or changed heart murmur, which is the heart sounds made by blood rushing through your heart Swelling in your feet, legs or abdomen Endocarditis can also cause symptoms that are more uncommon.	general
These include: Unexplained weight loss Blood in your urine, which you might be able to see or that your doctor might see when he or she views your urine under a microscope Tenderness in your spleen, which is an infection-fighting abdominal organ just below your rib cage on the left side of your body Janeway lesions, which are red spots on the soles of your feet or the palms of your hands Osler's nodes, which are red, tender spots under the skin of your fingers or toes Petechiae (puh-TEE-key-e), which are tiny purple or red spots on the skin, whites of your eyes, or inside your mouth When to see a doctor If you develop signs or symptoms of endocarditis, and if they don't go away, see your doctor as soon as possible ‚Äî especially if you have risk factors for this serious infection, such as a heart defect or a previous case of endocarditis.	general
Although less serious conditions can cause similar signs and symptoms, you won't know for sure until you're evaluated by your doctor.	general
Endocarditis occurs when germs enter your bloodstream, travel to your heart, and attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue.	general
Certain types of bacteria cause most cases, but fungi or other microorganisms also may be responsible.	general
Usually, your immune system destroys harmful bacteria that make it into your bloodstream.	general
Even if bacteria reach your heart, they may pass through without causing an infection.	general
However, bacteria that live in your mouth, throat or other parts of your body, such as your skin or your gut, can sometimes cause serious infections like endocarditis under the right circumstances.	general
Bacteria, fungi or other germs that cause endocarditis might enter your bloodstream through: Activities such as brushing your teeth, or other activities that could cause your gums to bleed, can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream ‚Äî especially if you don't floss or your teeth and gums aren't healthy.	general
Everyday oral activities.	general
Bacteria may spread from an infected area, such as a skin sore.	general
Other medical conditions, such as gum disease, a sexually transmitted infection or certain intestinal disorders ‚Äî such as inflammatory bowel disease ‚Äî can also give bacteria the opportunity to enter your bloodstream.	general
An infection or other medical condition.	general
Bacteria can enter your body through a catheter ‚Äî a thin tube that doctors sometimes use to inject or remove fluid from the body.	general
This is more likely to occur if the catheter is in place for a long period of time.	general
The bacteria that can cause endocarditis can also enter your bloodstream through the needles used for tattooing or body piercing.	general
Needles used for tattoos and body piercing.	general
Contaminated needles and syringes are a special concern for people who use illegal intravenous (IV) drugs, such as heroin or cocaine.	general
Often, individuals who use these types of drugs don't have access to clean, unused needles or syringes.	general
Intravenous (IV) illegal drug use.	general
Some dental procedures that can cut your gums may allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream.	general
Certain dental procedures.	general
Bacteria can more easily attach to the lining of your heart (endocardium), if the lining's surface is rough.	general
You're also more likely to develop endocarditis if you have faulty, diseased or damaged heart valves.	general
However, endocarditis does occasionally occur in previously healthy individuals.	general
Risk factors Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers.	general
The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood.	general
The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart.	general
The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.	general
If your heart is healthy, you could be less likely to develop endocarditis, although it is still possible.	general
The germs that cause infection tend to stick to and multiply on damaged or surgically implanted heart valves, or on endocardium that has a rough surface.	general
People at highest risk of endocarditis are those who have: Germs are more likely to attach to an artificial (prosthetic) heart valve than to a normal heart valve.	general
Artificial heart valves.	general
If you were born with certain types of heart defects, such as an irregular heart or abnormal heart valves, your heart may be more susceptible to infection.	general
Congenital heart defects.	general
Endocarditis can damage heart tissue and valves, increasing the risk of a future heart infection.	general
A history of endocarditis.	general
Certain medical conditions, such as rheumatic fever or infection, can damage or scar one or more of your heart valves.	general
This can make them more prone to endocarditis.	general
Damaged heart valves.	general
People who use illegal drugs by injecting them are at a greater risk of endocarditis.	general
The needles used to inject drugs can be contaminated with the bacteria that can cause endocarditis.	general
A history of intravenous (IV) illegal drug use.	general
Complications In endocarditis, clumps of bacteria and cell fragments form in your heart at the site of the infection.	general
These clumps, called vegetations, can break loose and travel to your brain, lungs, abdominal organs, kidneys or limbs.	general
As a result, endocarditis can cause several major complications, including: Heart problems, such as heart murmur, heart valve damage and heart failure Loss of the ability to move part of all of your body (paralysis) Pockets of collected pus (abscesses) that develop in the heart, brain, lungs and other organs Pulmonary embolism ‚Äî an infected vegetation that travels to the lungs and blocks a lung artery Kidney damage Enlarged spleen You can help prevent endocarditis in several ways, including: Know the signs and symptoms of endocarditis.	general
See your doctor immediately if you develop any signs or symptoms, especially a fever that won't go away, unexplained fatigue, any type of skin infection, or open cuts or sores that don't heal properly.	general
Pay special attention to your dental health ‚Äî brush and floss your teeth and gums often, and have regular dental checkups.	general
Avoid procedures that may lead to skin infections, such as body piercings or tattoos.	general
Preventive antibiotics Certain dental and medical procedures may allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream.	general
For some people with heart disease or damaged or diseased heart valves, taking antibiotics before these procedures can help destroy or control the harmful bacteria that may lead to endocarditis.	general
This is because these people are more at risk of developing endocarditis after having these procedures.	general
In the past, doctors gave antibiotics to many people before dental or other surgical procedures, such as procedures involving the intestinal or urinary tracts, even if they weren't at high risk of developing endocarditis.	general
However, antibiotics are no longer recommended before all dental or other surgical procedures, or for all people.	general
As doctors have learned more about endocarditis prevention, they've realized endocarditis is much more likely to occur from exposure to random germs than from a standard dental exam or surgery.	general
If you're at risk of endocarditis, let your doctor and dentist know before having any dental work.	general
They will decide whether you need antibiotics before any dental procedures.	general
It's still important to take good care of your teeth through brushing and flossing, since doctors have some concern that infections in your mouth from poor oral hygiene might increase the risk of germs entering your bloodstream.	general
In addition to brushing and flossing, regular dental exams are an important part of maintaining good oral health.	general
Uterine polyps Uterine polyps Uterine polyps attach to your uterus by a large base or a thin stalk and can grow to be several centimeters in size.	general
Irregular menstrual bleeding, bleeding after menopause, excessively heavy menstrual flow or bleeding between periods could signal the presence of uterine polyps.	general
Uterine polyps are growths attached to the inner wall of the uterus that extend into the uterine cavity.	general
Overgrowth of cells in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) leads to the formation of uterine polyps, also known as endometrial polyps.	general
These polyps are usually noncancerous (benign), although some can be cancerous or can eventually turn into cancer (precancerous polyps).	general
Uterine polyps range in size from a few millimeters ‚Äî no larger than a sesame seed ‚Äî to several centimeters ‚Äî golf-ball-size or larger.	general
They attach to the uterine wall by a large base or a thin stalk.	general
You can have one or many uterine polyps.	general
They usually stay contained within your uterus, but occasionally, they slip down through the opening of the uterus (cervix) into your vagina.	general
Uterine polyps most commonly occur in women who are going through or have completed menopause, although younger women can get them, too.	general
Irregular menstrual bleeding ‚Äî for example, having frequent, unpredictable periods of variable length and heaviness Bleeding between menstrual periods Excessively heavy menstrual periods Vaginal bleeding after menopause Infertility Some women have only light bleeding or spotting; others are symptom-free.	general
When to see a doctor Seek medical care if you have: Vaginal bleeding after menopause Bleeding between menstrual periods Hormonal factors appear to play a role.	general
Uterine polyps are estrogen-sensitive, meaning they grow in response to circulating estrogen.	general
Risk factors Being perimenopausal or postmenopausal Being obese Complications Uterine polyps might be associated with infertility.	general
If you have uterine polyps and you're unable to have children, removal of the polyps might allow you to become pregnant, but the data are inconclusive.	general
Endometriosis Endometriosis Endometriosis occurs when bits of the tissue that lines the uterus (endometrium) grow on other pelvic organs, such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes.	general
Outside the uterus, endometrial tissue thickens and bleeds, just as the normal endometrium does during the menstrual cycle.	general
Endometriosis (en-doe-me-tree-O-sis) is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus ‚Äî the endometrium ‚Äî grows outside your uterus.	general
Endometriosis most commonly involves your ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining your pelvis.	general
Rarely, endometrial tissue may spread beyond pelvic organs.	general
With endometriosis, the endometrial-like tissue acts as endometrial tissue would ‚Äî it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle.	general
But because this tissue has no way to exit your body, it becomes trapped.	general
When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form.	general
Surrounding tissue can become irritated, eventually developing scar tissue and adhesions ‚Äî abnormal bands of fibrous tissue that can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other.	general
Endometriosis can cause pain ‚Äî sometimes severe ‚Äî especially during menstrual periods.	general
Fertility problems also may develop.	general
Fortunately, effective treatments are available.	general
Products & Services The primary symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain, often associated with menstrual periods.	general
Although many experience cramping during their menstrual periods, those with endometriosis typically describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual.	general
Pain also may increase over time.	general
Common signs and symptoms of endometriosis include: Pelvic pain and cramping may begin before and extend several days into a menstrual period.	general
You may also have lower back and abdominal pain.	general
Painful periods (dysmenorrhea).	general
Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis.	general
Pain with intercourse.	general
You're most likely to experience these symptoms during a menstrual period.	general
Pain with bowel movements or urination.	general
You may experience occasional heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding).	general
Excessive bleeding.	general
Sometimes, endometriosis is first diagnosed in those seeking treatment for infertility.	general
Infertility.	general
You may experience fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea, especially during menstrual periods.	general
Other signs and symptoms.	general
The severity of your pain isn't necessarily a reliable indicator of the extent of the condition.	general
You could have mild endometriosis with severe pain, or you could have advanced endometriosis with little or no pain.	general
Endometriosis is sometimes mistaken for other conditions that can cause pelvic pain, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ovarian cysts.	general
It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition that causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal cramping.	general
IBS can accompany endometriosis, which can complicate the diagnosis.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms that may indicate endometriosis.	general
Endometriosis can be a challenging condition to manage.	general
An early diagnosis, a multidisciplinary medical team and an understanding of your diagnosis may result in better management of your symptoms.	general
More Information Although the exact cause of endometriosis is not certain, possible explanations include: In retrograde menstruation, menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body.	general
These endometrial cells stick to the pelvic walls and surfaces of pelvic organs, where they grow and continue to thicken and bleed over the course of each menstrual cycle.	general
Retrograde menstruation.	general
"In what's known as the ""induction theory,"" experts propose that hormones or immune factors promote transformation of peritoneal cells ‚Äî cells that line the inner side of your abdomen ‚Äî into endometrial-like cells."	general
Transformation of peritoneal cells.	general
Hormones such as estrogen may transform embryonic cells ‚Äî cells in the earliest stages of development ‚Äî into endometrial-like cell implants during puberty.	general
Embryonic cell transformation.	general
After a surgery, such as a hysterectomy or C-section, endometrial cells may attach to a surgical incision.	general
Surgical scar implantation.	general
The blood vessels or tissue fluid (lymphatic) system may transport endometrial cells to other parts of the body.	general
Endometrial cell transport.	general
A problem with the immune system may make the body unable to recognize and destroy endometrial-like tissue that's growing outside the uterus.	general
Immune system disorder.	general
More Information Risk factors Several factors place you at greater risk of developing endometriosis, such as: Never giving birth Short menstrual cycles ‚Äî for instance, less than 27 days Heavy menstrual periods that last longer than seven days Having higher levels of estrogen in your body or a greater lifetime exposure to estrogen your body produces Low body mass index One or more relatives (mother, aunt or sister) with endometriosis Any medical condition that prevents the normal passage of menstrual flow out of the body Reproductive tract abnormalities Endometriosis usually develops several years after the onset of menstruation (menarche).	general
Signs and symptoms of endometriosis may temporarily improve with pregnancy and may go away completely with menopause, unless you're taking estrogen.	general
Complications Infertility Fertilization and implantation Fertilization and implantation During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote.	general
Then the zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula.	general
Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst.	general
The blastocyst then burrows into the uterine wall ‚Äîa process called implantation.	general
The main complication of endometriosis is impaired fertility.	general
Approximately one-third to one-half of women with endometriosis have difficulty getting pregnant.	general
For pregnancy to occur, an egg must be released from an ovary, travel through the neighboring fallopian tube, become fertilized by a sperm cell and attach itself to the uterine wall to begin development.	general
Endometriosis may obstruct the tube and keep the egg and sperm from uniting.	general
But the condition also seems to affect fertility in less-direct ways, such as by damaging the sperm or egg.	general
Even so, many with mild to moderate endometriosis can still conceive and carry a pregnancy to term.	general
Doctors sometimes advise those with endometriosis not to delay having children because the condition may worsen with time.	general
Ovarian cancer does occur at higher than expected rates in those with endometriosis.	general
But the overall lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is low to begin with.	general
Some studies suggest that endometriosis increases that risk, but it's still relatively low.	general
Although rare, another type of cancer ‚Äî endometriosis-associated adenocarcinoma ‚Äî can develop later in life in those who have had endometriosis.	general
Enlarged breasts in men (gynecomastia) Enlarged breasts in men (gynecomastia) With gynecomastia, tissue inside the breast glands grows.	general
This can cause female-appearing breasts.	general
Gynecomastia (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh) is an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue in boys or men, caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone.	general
Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly.	general
Newborns, boys going through puberty and older men may develop gynecomastia as a result of normal changes in hormone levels, though other causes also exist.	general
Generally, gynecomastia isn't a serious problem, but it can be tough to cope with the condition.	general
Men and boys with gynecomastia sometimes have pain in their breasts and may feel embarrassed.	general
Gynecomastia may go away on its own.	general
If it persists, medication or surgery may help.	general
Swollen breast tissue See your doctor if you have: Gynecomastia is triggered by a decrease in the amount of the hormone testosterone compared with estrogen.	general
The decrease can be caused by conditions that block the effects of testosterone, reduce testosterone or increase your estrogen level.	general
Several things can upset the hormone balance, including the following.	general
Natural hormone changes The hormones testosterone and estrogen control sex characteristics in both men and women.	general
Testosterone controls male traits, such as muscle mass and body hair.	general
Estrogen controls female traits, including the growth of breasts.	general
Most people think of estrogen as an exclusively female hormone, but men also produce it ‚Äî though normally in small quantities.	general
Male estrogen levels that are too high or are out of balance with testosterone levels can cause gynecomastia.	general
More than half of male infants are born with enlarged breasts due to the effects of their mother's estrogen.	general
Generally, the swollen breast tissue goes away within two to three weeks after birth.	general
Gynecomastia in infants.	general
Gynecomastia caused by hormone changes during puberty is relatively common.	general
In most cases, the swollen breast tissue will go away without treatment within six months to two years.	general
Gynecomastia during puberty.	general
The prevalence of gynecomastia peaks again between the ages of 50 and 69.	general
At least 1 in 4 men in this age group is affected.	general
Gynecomastia in adults.	general
Medications Anti-androgens used to treat an enlarged prostate, prostate cancer and other conditions.	general
Examples include flutamide, finasteride (Proscar, Propecia) and spironolactone (Aldactone, Carospir).	general
Anabolic steroids and androgens, which are prescribed by doctors for certain conditions or are sometimes used illegally by athletes to build muscle and enhance performance.	general
medications.	general
Gynecomastia can develop in men who are -positive and receiving a treatment regimen called highly active antiretroviral therapy.	general
Efavirenz (Sustiva) is more commonly associated with gynecomastia than are other medications.	general
Anti-anxiety medications, such as diazepam (Valium).	general
Tricyclic antidepressants.	general
Ulcer medications, such as the over-the-counter drug cimetidine (Tagamet HB).	general
Cancer treatment.	general
Heart medications, such as digoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers.	general
Stomach-emptying medications, such as metoclopramide (Reglan).	general
Street drugs and alcohol Health conditions Several health conditions can cause gynecomastia by affecting the normal balance of hormones.	general
These include: Conditions that interfere with normal testosterone production, such as Klinefelter syndrome or pituitary insufficiency, can be associated with gynecomastia.	general
Hypogonadism.	general
Hormone changes that occur with normal aging can cause gynecomastia, especially in men who are overweight.	general
Some tumors, such as those involving the testes, adrenal glands or pituitary gland, can produce hormones that alter the male-female hormone balance.	general
In this condition, the thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine.	general
Hyperthyroidism.	general
About half the people being treated with dialysis experience gynecomastia due to hormonal changes.	general
Kidney failure.	general
Changes in hormone levels related to liver problems and cirrhosis medications are associated with gynecomastia.	general
Liver failure and cirrhosis.	general
When your body is deprived of adequate nutrition, testosterone levels drop while estrogen levels remain the same, causing a hormonal imbalance.	general
Gynecomastia can also happen when normal nutrition resumes.	general
Malnutrition and starvation.	general
Herbal products Plant oils, such as tea tree or lavender, used in shampoos, soaps or lotions have been associated with gynecomastia.	general
This is probably due to their weak estrogenic activity.	general
Risk factors Adolescence Use of anabolic steroids or androgens to enhance athletic performance Certain health conditions, including liver and kidney disease, thyroid disease, hormonally active tumors, and Klinefelter syndrome Complications Gynecomastia has few physical complications, but it can cause psychological or emotional problems caused by appearance.	general
There are a few factors you can control that may reduce the risk of gynecomastia: Examples include steroids and androgens, amphetamines, heroin, and marijuana.	general
Don't use drugs.	general
Don't drink alcohol.	general
If you do drink, do so in moderation.	general
Avoid alcohol.	general
If you're taking medication known to cause gynecomastia, ask your doctor if there are other choices.	general
Review your medications.	general
An enlarged liver can have many possible causes.	general
An enlarged liver is one that's bigger than normal.	general
The medical term is hepatomegaly (hep-uh-toe-MEG-uh-le).	general
Rather than a disease, an enlarged liver is a sign of an underlying problem, such as liver disease, congestive heart failure or cancer.	general
Treatment involves identifying and controlling the cause of the condition.	general
An enlarged liver might not cause symptoms.	general
When enlarged liver results from liver disease, it might be accompanied by: Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have symptoms that worry you.	general
The liver is a large, football-shaped organ found in the upper right portion of your abdomen.	general
The size of the liver varies with age, sex and body size.	general
Many conditions can cause it to enlarge, including: Liver diseases Hepatitis caused by a virus ‚Äî including hepatitis A, B and C ‚Äî or caused by infectious mononucleosis Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Alcoholic fatty liver disease A disorder that causes abnormal protein to accumulate in your liver (amyloidosis) A genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in your liver (Wilson's disease) A disorder that causes iron to accumulate in your liver (hemachromatosis) A disorder that causes fatty substances to accumulate in your liver (Gaucher's disease) Fluid-filled pockets in the liver (liver cysts) Noncancerous liver tumors, including hemangioma and adenoma Obstruction of the gallbladder or bile ducts Toxic hepatitis Cancer that begins in another part of the body and spreads to the liver Blockage of the veins that drain the liver (Budd-Chiari syndrome) Heart failure Risk factors You're more likely to develop an enlarged liver if you have a liver disease.	general
Factors that can increase your risk of liver problems include: Drinking large amounts of alcohol can be damaging to your liver.	general
Excessive alcohol use.	general
Taking larger than recommended doses of vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medicines can increase your risk of liver damage.	general
Large doses of medicines, vitamins or supplements.	general

Enlarged spleen Enlarged spleen The spleen is a small organ normally about the size of your fist.	general
A number of conditions, including liver disease and some cancers, can cause your spleen to become enlarged.	general
Your spleen is an organ located just below your left rib cage.	general
Many conditions ‚Äî including infections, liver disease and some cancers ‚Äî can cause an enlarged spleen, also known as splenomegaly (spleh-no-MEG-uh-lee).	general
An enlarged spleen usually doesn't cause symptoms.	general
It's often discovered during a routine physical exam.	general
Your doctor generally can't feel a normal-sized spleen in adults but can feel an enlarged spleen.	general
Your doctor will likely request imaging and blood tests to help identify the cause.	general
Treatment for an enlarged spleen focuses on the underlying condition that's causing it.	general
Surgically removing an enlarged spleen isn't usually the first treatment, but is sometimes recommended.	general
An enlarged spleen may cause: No symptoms in some cases Pain or fullness in the left upper abdomen that may spread to the left shoulder Feeling full without eating or after eating only a small amount from the enlarged spleen pressing on your stomach When to see a doctor See your doctor promptly if you have pain in your left upper abdomen, especially if it's severe or the pain gets worse when you take a deep breath.	general
A number of infections and diseases may cause an enlarged spleen.	general
The enlargement of the spleen may be temporary, depending on treatment.	general
Contributing factors include: Viral infections, such as mononucleosis Bacterial infections, such as syphilis or an infection of your heart's inner lining (endocarditis) Parasitic infections, such as malaria Cirrhosis and other diseases affecting the liver Various types of hemolytic anemia ‚Äî a condition characterized by early destruction of red blood cells Blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms, and lymphomas, such as Hodgkin's disease Metabolic disorders, such as Gaucher's disease and Niemann-Pick disease Pressure on the veins in the spleen or liver or a blood clot in these veins How the spleen works Your spleen is tucked under your rib cage next to your stomach on the left side of your abdomen.	general
It's a soft, spongy organ that performs several critical jobs.	general
Your spleen: Filters out and destroys old, damaged blood cells Prevents infection by producing white blood cells (lymphocytes) and acting as a first line of defense against disease-causing organisms Stores red blood cells and platelets, which help your blood clot An enlarged spleen affects each of these vital functions.	general
As your spleen grows larger, it filters normal red blood cells as well as abnormal ones, reducing the number of healthy cells in your bloodstream.	general
It also traps too many platelets.	general
Excess red blood cells and platelets eventually can clog your spleen and affect normal functioning.	general
An enlarged spleen may even outgrow its own blood supply, which can damage or destroy sections of the organ.	general
Risk factors Anyone can develop an enlarged spleen at any age, but certain groups are at higher risk, including: Children and young adults with infections, such as mononucleosis People who have Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, and several other inherited metabolic disorders affecting the liver and spleen People who live in or travel to areas where malaria is common Complications Potential complications of an enlarged spleen are: An enlarged spleen can reduce the number of healthy red blood cells, platelets and white cells in your bloodstream, leading to more frequent infections.	general
Anemia and increased bleeding also are possible.	general
Even healthy spleens are soft and easily damaged, especially in car crashes.	general
The possibility of rupture is much greater when your spleen is enlarged.	general
A ruptured spleen can cause life-threatening bleeding into your abdominal cavity.	general
Ruptured spleen.	general
Enlarged thyroid Enlarged thyroid Widespread enlargement of your thyroid can expand the gland well beyond its normal size (left) and cause a noticeable bulge in your neck (right).	general
A goiter (GOI-tur) is an abnormal enlargement of your thyroid gland.	general
Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of your neck just below your Adam's apple.	general
Although goiters are usually painless, a large goiter can cause a cough and make it difficult for you to swallow or breathe.	general
The most common cause of goiters worldwide is a lack of iodine in the diet.	general
In the United States, where the use of iodized salt is common, a goiter is more often due to the over- or underproduction of thyroid hormones or to nodules in the gland itself.	general
Treatment depends on the size of the goiter, your symptoms and the cause.	general
Small goiters that aren't noticeable and don't cause problems usually don't need treatment.	general
Not all goiters cause signs and symptoms.	general
When signs and symptoms do occur they may include: A swelling at the base of your neck that may be particularly obvious when you shave or put on makeup A tight feeling in your throat Pituitary gland and hypothalamus Pituitary gland and hypothalamus The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are located within the brain and control hormone production.	general
Your thyroid gland produces two main hormones ‚Äî thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3).	general
These hormones circulate in your bloodstream and help regulate your metabolism.	general
They maintain the rate at which your body uses fats and carbohydrates, help control your body temperature, influence your heart rate, and help regulate the production of proteins.	general
Your thyroid gland also produces calcitonin ‚Äî a hormone that helps regulate the amount of calcium in your blood.	general
Your pituitary gland and hypothalamus control the rate at which T-4 and T-3 are produced and released.	general
The hypothalamus ‚Äî an area at the base of your brain that acts as a thermostat for your whole system ‚Äî signals your pituitary gland to make a hormone known as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).	general
Your pituitary gland ‚Äî also located at the base of your brain ‚Äî releases a certain amount of , depending on how much thyroxine and T-3 are in your blood.	general
Your thyroid gland, in turn, regulates its production of hormones based on the amount of it receives from the pituitary gland.	general
Having a goiter doesn't necessarily mean that your thyroid gland isn't working normally.	general
Even when it's enlarged, your thyroid may produce normal amounts of hormones.	general
It might also, however, produce too much or too little thyroxine and T-3.	general
Thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules Enlargement of your thyroid can expand the gland well beyond its normal size and cause a noticeable bulge in your neck.	general
This can be caused by single or multiple nodules (lumps) in your thyroid, or by an autoimmune process.	general
Several things can cause your thyroid gland to enlarge.	general
Some of the most common are: Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones, and is found primarily in seawater and in the soil in coastal areas.	general
In the developing world, people who live inland or at high elevations are often iodine deficient and can develop goiters when the thyroid enlarges in an effort to obtain more iodine.	general
Iodine deficiency may be made worse by a diet high in hormone-inhibiting foods, such as cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower.	general
Iodine deficiency.	general
In countries where iodine is routinely added to table salt and other foods, a lack of dietary iodine isn't usually the cause of goiters.	general
A goiter can sometimes occur when your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism).	general
In someone who has Graves' disease, antibodies produced by the immune system mistakenly attack the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excess thyroxine.	general
This overstimulation causes the thyroid to swell.	general
Graves' disease.	general
A goiter can also result from an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).	general
Like Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder.	general
But instead of causing your thyroid to produce too much hormone, Hashimoto's damages your thyroid so that it produces too little.	general
Hashimoto's disease.	general
Sensing a low hormone level, your pituitary gland produces more to stimulate the thyroid, which then causes the gland to enlarge.	general
In this condition, several solid or fluid-filled lumps called nodules develop in both sides of your thyroid, resulting in overall enlargement of the gland.	general
Multinodular goiter.	general
In this case, a single nodule develops in one part of your thyroid gland.	general
Most nodules are noncancerous (benign) and don't lead to cancer.	general
Solitary thyroid nodules.	general
Thyroid cancer is far less common than benign thyroid nodules.	general
A biopsy of a thyroid nodule is very accurate in determining whether it's cancerous.	general
Thyroid cancer.	general
A hormone produced during pregnancy, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), may cause your thyroid gland to enlarge slightly.	general
Thyroiditis is an inflammatory condition that can cause pain and swelling in the thyroid.	general
It may also cause the body to produce too much or too little thyroxine.	general
Inflammation.	general
Risk factors Goiters can affect anyone.	general
They may be present at birth and occur at any time throughout life.	general
Some common risk factors for goiters include: People living in areas where iodine is in short supply and who don't have access to iodine supplements are at high risk of goiters.	general
A lack of dietary iodine.	general
Because women are more prone to thyroid disorders, they're also more likely to develop goiters.	general
Being female.	general
Goiters are more common after age 40.	general
A personal or family history of autoimmune disease increases your risk.	general
Medical history.	general
For reasons that aren't entirely clear, thyroid problems are more likely to occur during pregnancy and menopause.	general
Pregnancy and menopause.	general
Some medical treatments, including the heart drug amiodarone (Pacerone, others) and the psychiatric drug lithium (Lithobid, others), increase your risk.	general
Certain medications.	general
Your risk increases if you've had radiation treatments to your neck or chest area or you've been exposed to radiation in a nuclear facility, test or accident.	general
Radiation exposure.	general
Complications Small goiters that don't cause physical or cosmetic problems aren't a concern.	general
But large goiters can make it hard to breathe or swallow and can cause a cough and hoarseness.	general
Goiters that result from other conditions, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, may be associated with a number of symptoms, ranging from fatigue and weight gain to unintended weight loss, irritability and trouble sleeping.	general
Entropion is a condition in which your eyelid, usually the lower one, is turned inward so that your eyelashes rub against your eyeball, causing discomfort.	general
Entropion (en-TROH-pee-on) is a condition in which your eyelid turns inward so that your eyelashes and skin rub against the eye surface.	general
This causes irritation and discomfort.	general
When you have entropion, your eyelid may be turned in all the time or only when you blink hard or squeeze your eyelids shut.	general
Entropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid.	general
Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of entropion.	general
But usually surgery is needed to fully correct the condition.	general
Left untreated, entropion can cause damage to the transparent covering in the front part of your eye (cornea), eye infections and vision loss.	general
The signs and symptoms of entropion result from the friction of your eyelashes and outer eyelid against the surface of your eye.	general
You may experience: The feeling that something is in your eye Eye redness Watery eyes (excessive tearing) Mucous discharge and eyelid crusting When to see a doctor Seek immediate care if you have received a diagnosis of entropion and you experience: Rapidly increasing redness in your eyes Decreasing vision These are signs and symptoms of cornea injury, which can harm your vision.	general
Make an appointment to see your doctor if you feel like you constantly have something in your eye or you notice that some of your eyelashes seem to be turning in toward your eye.	general
If you leave entropion untreated for too long, it can cause permanent damage to your eye.	general
Start using artificial tears and eye-lubricating ointments to protect your eye before your appointment.	general
Entropion can be caused by: As you age, the muscles under your eyes tend to weaken, and the tendons stretch out.	general
This is the most common cause of entropion.	general
Muscle weakness.	general
Skin scarred by chemical burns, trauma or surgery can distort the normal curve of the eyelid.	general
Scars or previous surgeries.	general
An eye infection called trachoma is common in many developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Pacific Islands.	general
It can cause scarring of the inner eyelid, leading to entropion and even blindness.	general
Eye infection.	general
An irritation of the eye caused by dryness or inflammation can lead you to try to relieve the symptoms by rubbing the eyelids or squeezing them shut.	general
This can lead to a spasm of the eyelid muscles and a rolling of the edge of the lid inward against the cornea (spastic entropion).	general
Inflammation.	general
When entropion is present at birth (congenital), it may be caused by an extra fold of skin on the eyelid that causes turned-in eyelashes.	general
Developmental complication.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing entropion include: The older you are, the greater your chances of developing the condition.	general
If you've had a burn or other injury on your face, the resulting scar tissue may put you at higher risk of developing entropion.	general
Previous burns or trauma.	general
Because trachoma can scar the inner eyelids, people who have had this infection are more likely to develop entropion.	general
Trachoma infection.	general
Complications Corneal irritation and injury are the most serious complications related to entropion because they can lead to permanent vision loss.	general
Generally, entropion isn't preventable.	general
You may be able to prevent the type caused by trachoma infection.	general
If your eyes become red and irritated after you visit an area where trachoma infection is common, seek evaluation and treatment immediately.	general
Eosinophilic esophagitis Eosinophilic esophagitis Esophagitis is inflammation that damages the lining of the esophagus.	general
An endoscope ‚Äî a long, flexible tube equipped with a camera ‚Äî may be used to see inside your esophagus.	general
This endoscopic image of eosinophilic esophagitis shows rings of abnormal tissue (esophageal rings) resulting from chronic inflammation.	general
In eosinophilic esophagitis (e-o-sin-o-FILL-ik uh-sof-uh-JIE-tis), a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) builds up in the lining of the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach (esophagus).	general
This buildup, which is a reaction to foods, allergens or acid reflux, can inflame or injure the esophageal tissue.	general
Damaged esophageal tissue can lead to difficulty swallowing or cause food to get stuck when you swallow.	general
Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic immune system disease.	general
It has been identified only in the past two decades, but is now considered a major cause of digestive system (gastrointestinal) illness.	general
Research is ongoing and will likely lead to revisions in the diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.	general
Food getting stuck in the esophagus after swallowing (impaction) Chest pain that is often centrally located and does not respond to antacids Persistent heartburn Backflow of undigested food (regurgitation) No response to GERD medication Failure to thrive (poor growth, malnutrition and weight loss) When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical attention if you experience chest pain, especially if you also have shortness of breath or jaw or arm pain.	general
These may be symptoms of a heart attack.	general
Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience severe or frequent eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms.	general
If you take over-the-counter medications for heartburn more than twice a week, see your doctor.	general
Eosinophils are a normal type of white blood cells present in your digestive tract.	general
However, in eosinophilic esophagitis, you have an allergic reaction to an outside substance.	general
The reaction may occur as follows: The lining of your esophagus reacts to allergens, such as food or pollen.	general
Reaction of the esophagus.	general
The eosinophils multiply in your esophagus and produce a protein that causes inflammation.	general
Multiplication of eosinophils.	general
Inflammation can lead to scarring, narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the lining of your esophagus.	general
Damage to esophagus.	general
You may have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or have food become stuck when you swallow (impaction).	general
Dysphagia and impaction.	general
You may have other symptoms, such as chest pain or stomach pain.	general
Additional symptoms.	general
There has been a significant increase in numbers of people diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in the past decade.	general
At first, researchers thought this was due to an increase in awareness among doctors and greater availability of tests.	general
However, studies now suggest the disease is becoming increasingly common, parallel to the increase in asthma and allergy.	general
Risk factors The following risk factors are associated with eosinophilic esophagitis: People who live in a cold or dry climate are more likely than those in other climates to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.	general
You're more likely to be diagnosed between the spring and fall, probably because levels of pollen and other allergens are higher and people are more prone to be outdoors.	general
Eosinophilic esophagitis is more common in males than in females.	general
Doctors think eosinophilic esophagitis may run in the family (have a genetic component).	general
If your family members have eosinophilic esophagitis, you have a greater chance of being diagnosed.	general
Family history.	general
If you have food or environmental allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis or a chronic respiratory disease, you're more likely to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.	general
Allergies and asthma.	general
Originally, eosinophilic esophagitis was thought to be a childhood disease, but now it is known to be common in adults as well.	general
The symptoms differ somewhat between children and adults.	general
Complications In some people, eosinophilic esophagitis can lead to the following: This makes it difficult to swallow and more likely that you will have food get stuck.	general
Scarring and narrowing of the esophagus.	general
Because of inflammation of the esophagus, endoscopy can cause perforation or tears in the tissue that lines the esophagus.	general
Tearing can also occur in connection with retching that some people experience when they get food stuck in the esophagus.	general
Damage to the esophagus.	general
Ependymoma is a type of tumor that can form in the brain or spinal cord.	general
Ependymoma begins in the ependymal cells in the brain and spinal cord that line the passageways where the fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) that nourishes your brain flows.	general
Ependymoma can occur at any age, but most often occurs in young children.	general
Children with ependymoma may experience headaches and seizures.	general
Ependymoma that occurs in adults is more likely to form in the spinal cord and may cause weakness in the part of the body controlled by the nerves that are affected by the tumor.	general
Surgery is the primary treatment for ependymoma.	general
For more aggressive tumors or for tumors that can't be removed completely with surgery, additional treatments, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy, may be recommended.	general
Tests and procedures used to diagnose ependymoma include: During a neurological exam, your doctor will ask you about your child's signs and symptoms.	general
He or she may check your child's vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes.	general
Problems in one or more of these areas may provide clues about the part of your child's brain that could be affected by a brain tumor.	general
Neurological exam.	general
Imaging tests can help doctors determine the location and size of the brain tumor.	general
MRI is often used to diagnose brain tumors, and it may be used along with specialized MRI imaging, such as magnetic resonance angiography.	general
Because ependymoma can occur in both the brain and spine, imaging tests should be used to create pictures of both areas when a diagnosis of ependymoma is suspected.	general
Imaging tests.	general
Also called a spinal tap, this procedure involves inserting a needle between two bones in the lower spine to draw out fluid from around the spinal cord.	general
The fluid is tested to look for tumor cells or other abnormalities.	general
Removing cerebrospinal fluid for testing (lumbar puncture).	general
Based on your child's test results, the doctor may suspect ependymoma and recommend surgery to remove the tumor.	general
Once removed, the tumor cells will be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.	general
Specialized tests are used to determine the types of cells and their level of aggressiveness, which the doctor may use to guide treatment decisions.	general
Ependymoma treatment options include: Brain surgeons (neurosurgeons) work to remove as much of the ependymoma as possible.	general
The goal is to remove the entire tumor, but sometimes the ependymoma is located near sensitive brain or spinal tissue that makes that too risky.	general
Surgery to remove the ependymoma.	general
If the entire tumor is removed during surgery, your child may not require any additional treatment.	general
If some tumor remains, the neurosurgeon may recommend another operation to try to remove the rest of the tumor.	general
Additional treatments, such as radiation therapy, may be recommended for more aggressive tumors or if all of the tumor can't be removed.	general
Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells.	general
During radiation therapy, your child lies on a table while a machine moves around him or her, directing beams to precise points in the brain.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Radiation therapy may be recommended after surgery to help prevent more aggressive tumors from recurring or if neurosurgeons weren't able to remove the tumor completely.	general
Specialized techniques can help to ensure that treatment delivers radiation to the tumor cells and spares as much of the surrounding healthy tissue as possible.	general
Conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy and proton therapy are types of radiation therapy that allow doctors to carefully and precisely deliver radiation.	general
Technically a type of radiation and not an operation, stereotactic radiosurgery focuses multiple beams of radiation on precise points to kill the tumor cells.	general
Radiosurgery is sometimes used when an ependymoma recurs after surgery and radiation.	general
Radiosurgery.	general
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells.	general
Chemotherapy isn't very effective for most cases of ependymoma.	general
The role of chemotherapy is still largely experimental and is reserved for certain situations, such as when the tumor grows back despite surgery and radiation.	general
Chemotherapy.	general
Clinical trials are studies of new treatments.	general
These studies give you a chance to try the latest treatment options, but the risk of side effects may not be known.	general
Ask your doctor whether your child might be eligible to participate in a clinical trial.	general
Clinical trials.	general
Tennis elbow Tennis elbow The pain of tennis elbow occurs primarily where the tendons of your forearm muscles attach to the bony prominence on the outside of your elbow.	general
The pain may result from tiny tears in the tendon.	general
Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a painful condition that occurs when tendons in your elbow are overloaded, usually by repetitive motions of the wrist and arm.	general
Despite its name, athletes aren't the only people who develop tennis elbow.	general
People whose jobs feature the types of motions that can lead to tennis elbow include plumbers, painters, carpenters and butchers.	general
The pain of tennis elbow occurs primarily where the tendons of your forearm muscles attach to a bony bump on the outside of your elbow.	general
Pain can also spread into your forearm and wrist.	general
Rest and over-the-counter pain relievers often help relieve tennis elbow.	general
If conservative treatments don't help or if symptoms are disabling, your doctor might suggest surgery.	general
The pain associated with tennis elbow may radiate from the outside of your elbow into your forearm and wrist.	general
Pain and weakness may make it difficult to: Shake hands or grip an object Turn a doorknob When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor if self-care steps such as rest, ice and use of over-the-counter pain relievers don't ease your elbow pain and tenderness.	general
Tennis elbow is an overuse and muscle strain injury.	general
The cause is repeated contraction of the forearm muscles that you use to straighten and raise your hand and wrist.	general
The repeated motions and stress to the tissue may result in a series of tiny tears in the tendons that attach the forearm muscles to the bony prominence at the outside of your elbow.	general
As the name suggests, playing tennis ‚Äî especially repeated use of the backhand stroke with poor technique ‚Äî is one possible cause of tennis elbow.	general
However, many other common arm motions can cause tennis elbow, including: Using plumbing tools Repetitive computer mouse use Factors that may increase your risk of tennis elbow include: While tennis elbow affects people of all ages, it's most common in adults between the ages of 30 and 50.	general
People who have jobs that involve repetitive motions of the wrist and arm are more likely to develop tennis elbow.	general
Examples include plumbers, painters, carpenters, butchers and cooks.	general
Occupation.	general
Participating in racket sports increases your risk of tennis elbow, especially if you employ poor stroke technique.	general
Certain sports.	general
Junctional epidermolysis bullosa Junctional epidermolysis bullosa Junctional epidermolysis bullosa generally becomes apparent at birth and may be severe.	general
Large, ulcerated blisters are common to junctional epidermolysis bullosa and can lead to infections and loss of body fluids.	general
As a result, severe forms of the disease may be fatal.	general
Epidermolysis bullosa (ep-ih-dur-MOL-uh-sis buhl-LOE-sah) is a group of rare diseases that cause fragile, blistering skin.	general
The blisters may appear in response to minor injury, even from heat, rubbing, scratching or adhesive tape.	general
In severe cases, the blisters may occur inside the body, such as the lining of the mouth or the stomach.	general
Most types of epidermolysis bullosa are inherited.	general
The condition usually shows up in infancy or early childhood.	general
Some people don't develop signs and symptoms until adolescence or early adulthood.	general
Epidermolysis bullosa has no cure, though mild forms may improve with age.	general
Treatment focuses on caring for blisters and preventing new ones.	general
Epidermolysis bullosa signs and symptoms vary depending on type.	general
They include: Fragile skin that blisters easily, especially on the hands and feet Nails that are thick or don't form Blisters inside the mouth and throat Thickened skin on the palms and soles of the feet Scalp blistering, scarring and hair loss (scarring alopecia) Thin-appearing skin (atrophic scarring) Dental problems, such as tooth decay from poorly formed enamel Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Itchy, painful skin Epidermolysis bullosa blisters may not appear until a toddler first begins to walk or until an older child begins new physical activities that trigger more intense friction on the feet.	general
When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if you or your child develops blisters, particularly if you don't know the reason for them.	general
For infants, severe blistering can be life-threatening.	general
if you or your child: Seek immediate medical care Has problems swallowing Has problems breathing Shows signs of infection, such as warm, red, painful or swollen skin, pus, or a foul odor from a sore, and fever or chills Basement membrane zone Basement membrane zone Depending on the type of epidermolysis bullosa, blistering may occur in the top layer of skin (epidermis), the bottom layer (dermis) or the layer that separates the two (basement membrane zone).	general
Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern In an autosomal dominant disorder, the mutated gene is a dominant gene located on one of the nonsex chromosomes (autosomes).	general
You need only one mutated gene to be affected by this type of disorder.	general
A person with an autosomal dominant disorder ‚Äî in this case, the father ‚Äî has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one mutated gene (dominant gene) and a 50% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes (recessive genes).	general
Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern To have an autosomal recessive disorder, you inherit two mutated genes, one from each parent.	general
These disorders are usually passed on by two carriers.	general
Their health is rarely affected, but they have one mutated gene (recessive gene) and one normal gene (dominant gene) for the condition.	general
Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes (left), a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier (middle) and a 25% chance of having an affected child with two recessive genes (right).	general
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex Epidermolysis bullosa simplex Epidermolysis bullosa simplex usually becomes apparent at birth or during early infancy.	general
It's the most common and least severe type.	general
Blistering may be relatively mild with epidermolysis bullosa simplex.	general
Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa generally becomes apparent at birth or during early childhood.	general
More severe forms of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can lead to rough, thickened skin, scarring, and disfigurement of the hands and feet.	general
Epidermolysis bullosa is usually inherited.	general
The disease gene may be passed on from one parent who has the disease (autosomal dominant inheritance).	general
Or it may be passed on from both parents (autosomal recessive inheritance) or arise as a new mutation in the affected person that can be passed on.	general
The skin is made up of an outer layer (epidermis) and an underlying layer (dermis).	general
The area where the layers meet is called the basement membrane.	general
The various types of epidermolysis bullosa are largely defined by which layer the blisters form in.	general
The main types of epidermolysis bullosa are: This is the most common form.	general
It develops in the outer layer of skin and mainly affects the palms and the feet.	general
The blisters usually heal without scarring.	general
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex.	general
This type may be severe, with blisters beginning in infancy.	general
A baby with this condition may develop a hoarse-sounding cry from continual blistering and scarring of the vocal cords.	general
Junctional epidermolysis bullosa.	general
This type is related to a flaw in the gene that helps produce a type of collagen that provides strength to the pig-skinlike dermis layer of the skin.	general
If this substance is missing or doesn't function, the layers of the skin won't join properly.	general
Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.	general
Risk factors Having a family history of epidermolysis bullosa is the major risk factor for developing the disorder.	general
Complications Blistering skin is vulnerable to bacterial infection.	general
Sepsis occurs when bacteria from a massive infection enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body.	general
Sepsis is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening condition that can cause shock and organ failure.	general
Severe forms of epidermolysis bullosa can cause fusion of fingers or toes and abnormal bending of joints (contractures).	general
This can affect the function of the fingers, knees and elbows.	general
Fusion of fingers and changes in the joints.	general
Blisters in the mouth can make eating difficult and lead to malnutrition and anemia (such as low iron levels in the blood).	general
Problems with nutrition can also cause delayed wound healing and, in children, slowed growth.	general
Problems with nutrition.	general
Difficulty passing stool may be due to painful blisters in the anal area.	general
It can also be caused by not ingesting enough liquids or high-fiber foods, such as fruits and vegetables.	general
Constipation.	general
Tooth decay and problems with tissues inside the mouth are common with some types of epidermolysis bullosa.	general
Dental problems.	general
Adolescents and adults with certain types of epidermolysis bullosa are at high risk of developing a type of skin cancer known as squamous cell carcinoma.	general
Skin cancer.	general
Infants with a severe form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa are at high risk of infections and loss of body fluids from widespread blistering.	general
Their survival also may be threatened because of blistering, which may hamper their ability to eat and breathe.	general
Many of these infants die in childhood.	general
It's not possible to prevent epidermolysis bullosa.	general
But you can take steps to help prevent blisters and infection.	general
Your infant or child needs cuddling, but be very gentle.	general
To pick up your child, place him or her on soft material, such as cotton, and support under the buttocks and behind the neck.	general
Don't lift your child from under his or her arms.	general
Handle your child gently.	general
If your child wears diapers, remove the elastic bands and avoid cleansing wipes.	general
Line the diaper with a nonstick dressing or spread it with a thick layer of zinc oxide paste.	general
Take special care with the diaper area.	general
Set your thermostat so that your home remains cool and the temperature remains steady.	general
Keep the home environment cool.	general
Gently apply lubricants, such as petroleum jelly.	general
Keep the skin moist.	general
Use soft clothing that's simple to get on and off.	general
It may help to remove labels and put clothing on seam-side out to minimize scratching.	general
Try sewing foam pads into the lining of clothing by elbows, knees and other pressure points.	general
Use soft special shoes, if possible.	general
Dress your child in soft clothes.	general
Trim your child's fingernails regularly.	general
Consider putting mittens on him or her at bedtime to help prevent scratching and infection.	general
Prevent scratching.	general
As your child grows, encourage him or her to be involved in activities that don't cause skin injury.	general
Swimming is a good option.	general
For children with mild forms of epidermolysis bullosa, they can protect their skin by wearing long pants and sleeves for outdoor activities.	general
Encourage your child to be active.	general
For example, place sheepskin on car seats and line the bathing tub with a thick towel.	general
Cover hard surfaces.	general
Scrotum, testicle and epididymis Scrotum, testicle and epididymis Epididymitis is an inflammation of the small, coiled tube at the back of the testicle (epididymis).	general
Epididymitis (ep-ih-did-uh-MY-tis) is an inflammation of the coiled tube (epididymis) at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm.	general
Males of any age can get epididymitis.	general
Epididymitis is most often caused by a bacterial infection, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia.	general
Sometimes, a testicle also becomes inflamed ‚Äî a condition called epididymo-orchitis.	general
A swollen, red or warm scrotum Testicle pain and tenderness, usually on one side, that usually comes on gradually Painful urination or an urgent or frequent need to urinate Discharge from the penis Pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen or pelvic area Blood in the semen Chronic epididymitis Epididymitis that lasts longer than six weeks or that recurs is considered chronic.	general
Symptoms of chronic epididymitis might come on gradually.	general
Sometimes the cause of chronic epididymitis isn't identified.	general
When to see a doctor Never ignore scrotal pain or swelling, which can be caused by a number of conditions.	general
Some of them require immediate treatment to avoid permanent damage.	general
If scrotal pain is severe, seek emergency treatment.	general
See a doctor if you have discharge from your penis or pain when you urinate.	general
Causes of epididymitis include: Gonorrhea and chlamydia are the most common causes of epididymitis in young, sexually active men.	general
Bacteria from a urinary tract or prostate infection might spread from the infected site to the epididymis.	general
Also, viral infections, such as the mumps virus, can result in epididymitis.	general
Other infections.	general
This condition occurs when urine flows backward into the epididymis, possibly because of heavy lifting or straining.	general
Urine in the epididymis (chemical epididymitis).	general
A groin injury can cause epididymitis.	general
Rarely, epididymitis can be caused by tuberculosis infection.	general
Tuberculosis.	general
Risk factors Male reproductive system Male reproductive system The male reproductive system makes, stores and moves sperm.	general
The testicles produce sperm.	general
Fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland combines with sperm to make semen.	general
The penis ejaculates semen during sexual intercourse.	general
Certain sexual behaviors that can lead to STIs put you at risk of sexually transmitted epididymitis, including having: Sex with a partner who has an STI Sex without a condom A history of STIs Risk factors for nonsexually transmitted epididymitis include: History of prostate or urinary tract infections History of medical procedures that affect the urinary tract, such as insertion of a urinary catheter or scope into the penis An uncircumcised penis or an anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract Prostate enlargement, which increases the risk of bladder infections and epididymitis Complications Epididymo-orchitis, if the condition spreads from your epididymis to your testicle Rarely, reduced fertility To help protect against STIs that can cause epididymitis practice safer sex.	general
If you have recurrent urninary tract infections or other risk factors for epididymitis, your doctor might discuss with you other ways of preventing a recurrence.	general
An intracranial hematoma is a collection of blood within the skull, most commonly caused by rupture of a blood vessel within the brain or from trauma such as a car accident or fall.	general
The blood collection can be within the brain tissue or underneath the skull, pressing on the brain.	general
Although some head injuries ‚Äî such as one that causes only a brief lapse of consciousness (concussion) ‚Äî can be minor, an intracranial hematoma is potentially life-threatening.	general
It usually requires immediate treatment, often surgery to remove the blood.	general
You might develop signs and symptoms of an intracranial hematoma right after a blow to your head, or they may take weeks or longer to appear.	general
You might seem fine after a head injury, a period called the lucid interval.	general
However, with time, pressure on your brain increases, producing some or all of the following signs and symptoms: Increasing headache Slurred speech As more blood fills your brain or the narrow space between your brain and skull, other signs and symptoms may become apparent, such as: Unconsciousness An intracranial hematoma can be life-threatening, requiring emergency treatment.	general
after a blow to the head if you: Seek immediate medical attention Lose consciousness Have difficulties such as vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, unsteadiness If signs and symptoms aren't immediately evident after a blow to the head, watch for physical, mental and emotional changes.	general
For example, if someone seems fine after a blow to the head and can talk but later becomes unconscious, seek immediate medical care.	general
Also, even if you feel fine, ask someone to keep an eye on you.	general
Memory loss after a blow to your head can make you forget about the blow.	general
Someone you tell might be more likely to recognize the warning signs and get you medical attention.	general
Head injury, often from motor vehicle or bicycle accidents, falls, assaults, and sports injuries, is the most common cause of intracranial bleeding (hemorrhage).	general
If you're an older adult ‚Äî especially if you're taking an anticoagulant or an antiplatelet drug, such as aspirin ‚Äî even mild head trauma can cause a hematoma.	general
You can have a serious injury even if there's no open wound, bruise or other obvious damage.	general
There are three categories of hematoma ‚Äî subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma and intraparenchymal hematoma.	general
Subdural hematoma This occurs when blood vessels ‚Äî usually veins ‚Äî rupture between your brain and the outermost of three membrane layers that cover your brain (dura mater).	general
The leaking blood forms a hematoma that presses on the brain tissue.	general
An enlarging hematoma can cause gradual loss of consciousness and possibly death.	general
The three types of subdural hematomas are: This most dangerous type is generally caused by a severe head injury, and signs and symptoms usually appear immediately.	general
Signs and symptoms take time to develop, sometimes days or weeks after your injury.	general
The result of less severe head injuries, this type of hematoma can cause slow bleeding, and symptoms can take weeks and even months to appear.	general
You might not recall injuring your head.	general
For example, bumping your head while getting into the car can cause bleeding, especially if you're on blood-thinning medication.	general
All three types require medical attention as soon as signs and symptoms appear so that permanent brain damage can be prevented.	general
The risk of subdural hematoma increases as you age.	general
The risk is also greater for people who: Take aspirin or other blood-thinning medication daily Abuse alcohol Epidural hematoma Also called an extradural hematoma, this type occurs when a blood vessel ‚Äî usually an artery ‚Äî ruptures between the outer surface of the dura mater and the skull.	general
Blood then leaks between the dura mater and the skull to form a mass that presses on brain tissue.	general
The most common cause of an epidural hematoma is trauma.	general
Some people with this type of injury remain conscious, but most become drowsy or go into a coma from the moment of trauma.	general
An epidural hematoma that affects an artery in your brain can be deadly without prompt treatment.	general
Intraparenchymal hematoma This type of hematoma, also known as intracerebral hematoma, occurs when blood pools in the brain.	general
There are many causes, including trauma, rupture of an aneurysm, vascular malformation, high blood pressure and tumor.	general
There are also diseases that can cause spontaneous leakage of blood into the brain.	general
A head trauma can result in multiple severe intraparenchymal hematomas.	general
To prevent or minimize head injury: Wear an appropriate and properly fitted helmet when playing contact sports, bicycling, motorcycling, skiing, horseback riding, skating, skateboarding, snowboarding or doing any activity that could result in head injury.	general
Wear a helmet and make sure your kids wear helmets.	general
Do so every time you drive or ride in a motor vehicle.	general
Buckle your seat belt and make sure your kids are buckled in.	general
Always use properly fitted car seats, pad countertops and edges of tables, block stairways, tether heavy furniture or appliances to the wall to prevent tipping, and keep children from climbing on unsafe or unsteady objects.	general
Protect young children.	general
Your throat includes your esophagus, windpipe (trachea), voice box (larynx), tonsils and epiglottis.	general
"Epiglottitis is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the epiglottis ‚Äî a small cartilage ""lid"" that covers your windpipe ‚Äî swells, blocking the flow of air into your lungs."	general
A number of factors can cause the epiglottis to swell ‚Äî burns from hot liquids, direct injury to your throat and various infections.	general
The most common cause of epiglottitis in children in the past was infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), the same bacterium that causes pneumonia, meningitis and infections in the bloodstream.	general
Epiglottitis can occur at any age.	general
Routine Hib vaccination for infants has made epiglottitis rare, but the condition remains a concern.	general
If you suspect that you or someone in your family has epiglottitis, seek emergency help immediately.	general
Prompt treatment can prevent life-threatening complications.	general
Symptoms in children In children, signs and symptoms of epiglottitis may develop within a matter of hours, including: Difficult and painful swallowing Symptoms in adults For adults, signs and symptoms may develop more slowly, over days rather than hours.	general
Signs and symptoms may include: Severe sore throat Abnormal, high-pitched sound when breathing in (stridor) Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing When to see a doctor Epiglottitis is a medical emergency.	general
If you or someone you know suddenly has trouble breathing and swallowing, call your local emergency number or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.	general
Try to keep the person quiet and upright, because this position may make it easier to breathe.	general
Don't try to examine the person's throat yourself.	general
This can make matters worse.	general
In the past, a common cause of swelling and inflammation of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues was infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria.	general
Hib is responsible for a number of serious conditions, the most common of which is meningitis.	general
Hib is now much less common in developed countries due to Hib immunization in children.	general
Hib spreads through infected droplets coughed or sneezed into the air.	general
It's possible to harbor Hib in your nose and throat without becoming sick ‚Äî though you still can spread the bacteria to others.	general
In adults, other bacteria and viruses also can cause inflammation of the epiglottis, including: another bacterium that can cause meningitis, pneumonia, ear infection and blood infection (septicemia) Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a group of bacteria that can cause diseases ranging from strep throat to blood infection Streptococcus A, B and C, a bacterium that causes skin infections and other diseases including pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome Staphylococcus aureus, Physical injury, such as a direct blow to the throat, can cause epiglottitis.	general
So can burns from drinking very hot or caustic liquids.	general
You also may develop signs and symptoms similar to those of epiglottitis if you: Swallow a chemical that burns your throat Swallow a foreign object Risk factors Epiglottitis affects more males than females.	general
Being male.	general
If your immune system has been weakened by illness or medication, you're more susceptible to the bacterial infections that may cause epiglottitis.	general
Having a weakened immune system.	general
Delayed or skipped immunizations can leave a child vulnerable to Hib and increases the risk of epiglottitis.	general
Lacking adequate vaccination.	general
"Complications Epiglottitis can cause a number of complications, including: The epiglottis is a small, movable ""lid"" just above the larynx that prevents food and drink from entering your windpipe."	general
But if the epiglottis becomes swollen ‚Äî either from infection or from injury ‚Äî the airway narrows and may become completely blocked.	general
This can lead to respiratory failure ‚Äî a life-threatening condition in which the level of oxygen in the blood drops dangerously low or the level of carbon dioxide becomes excessively high.	general
Respiratory failure.	general
Sometimes the bacteria that cause epiglottitis cause infections elsewhere in the body, such as pneumonia, meningitis or a bloodstream infection.	general
Spreading infection.	general
Hib vaccine Immunization with the Hib vaccine is an effective way to prevent epiglottitis caused by Hib.	general
In the United States, children usually receive the vaccine in three or four doses: At 2 months At 4 months At 6 months if your child is being given the four-dose vaccine At 12 to 15 months The Hib vaccine is generally not given to children older than age 5 or to adults because they're less likely to develop Hib infection.	general
But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine for older children and adults whose immune systems have been weakened by: Sickle cell disease Medications to prevent rejection of organ or bone marrow transplants Vaccine side effects Seek immediate medical help if you have an allergic reaction.	general
Though rare, an allergic reaction may cause difficulty breathing, wheezing, hives, weakness, a rapid heartbeat or dizziness within minutes or a few hours after the shot.	general
Allergic reaction.	general
These include redness, warmth, swelling or pain at the injection site, and a fever.	general
Possible mild side effects.	general
Commonsense precautions Of course, the Hib vaccine doesn't offer guarantees.	general
Vaccinated children have been known to develop epiglottitis ‚Äî and other germs can cause epiglottitis, too.	general
That's where commonsense precautions come in: Don't share personal items.	general
Wash your hands frequently.	general
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available.	general
Brain lobes Brain lobes Each side of your brain contains four lobes.	general
The frontal lobe is important for cognitive functions and control of voluntary movement or activity.	general
The parietal lobe processes information about temperature, taste, touch and movement, while the occipital lobe is primarily responsible for vision.	general
The temporal lobe processes memories, integrating them with sensations of taste, sound, sight and touch.	general
Frontal lobe seizures are a common form of epilepsy, a neurological disorder in which clusters of brain cells send abnormal signals and cause seizures.	general
These types of seizures stem from the front of the brain.	general
Abnormal brain tissue, infection, injury, stroke, tumors or other conditions can also cause frontal lobe seizures.	general
Because the frontal lobe is large and has important functions, frontal lobe seizures can produce unusual symptoms that can appear to be related to psychiatric problems or a sleep disorder.	general
They often occur during sleep.	general
Medications usually can control frontal lobe seizures, but surgery or an electrical stimulation device might be options if anti-epileptic drugs aren't effective.	general
Frontal lobe seizures often last less than 30 seconds.	general
In some cases, recovery is immediate.	general
Signs and symptoms of frontal lobe seizures might include: Head and eye movement to one side Complete or partial unresponsiveness or difficulty speaking Explosive screams, including profanities, or laughter Abnormal body posturing, such as one arm extending while the other flexes, as if the person is posing like a fencer Repetitive movements, such as rocking, bicycle pedaling or pelvic thrusting When to see a doctor See your doctor if you're having signs or symptoms of a seizure.	general
Call 911 or call for emergency medical help if you see someone having a seizure that lasts longer than five minutes.	general
Frontal lobe seizures, or frontal lobe epilepsy, can be caused by abnormalities ‚Äî such as tumors, stroke, infection or traumatic injuries ‚Äî in the brain's frontal lobes.	general
Frontal lobe seizures are also associated with a rare inherited disorder called autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.	general
If one of your parents has this form of epilepsy, you have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the abnormal gene that causes this disorder and developing the disease yourself.	general
For about half the people who have frontal lobe epilepsy, the cause remains unknown.	general
Complications Frontal lobe seizures, which tend to occur in clusters, might provoke this dangerous condition in which seizure activity lasts much longer than usual.	general
Consider seizures that last longer than five minutes a medical emergency, and seek immediate help.	general
Status epilepticus.	general
The motions that occur during frontal lobe seizures sometimes result in injury to the person having the seizure.	general
Seizures can also result in accidents and drowning.	general
For unknown reasons, people who have seizures have a greater than average risk of dying unexpectedly.	general
Possible factors include heart or breathing problems, perhaps related to genetic abnormalities.	general
Controlling seizures as well as possible with medication appears to be the best prevention for .	general
Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP).	general
Both are common in people with epilepsy.	general
Children also have a higher risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	general
Depression and anxiety.	general
Epithelioid sarcoma Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare, slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer.	general
Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger, hand, forearm, lower leg or foot, though it can start in other areas of the body.	general
Typically, epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that's painless.	general
It usually starts out as a single growth, but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help.	general
Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don't heal, looking like open wounds over the growths.	general
The classic form (distal-type) of epithelioid sarcoma mainly occurs in teenagers and young adults.	general
A rarer form, called large-cell (proximal-type) epithelioid sarcoma, tends to be more aggressive and mainly affects adults.	general
Epithelioid sarcoma tends to have a high rate of recurrence and can spread to other areas.	general
So if epithelioid sarcoma is suspected, it's best to seek care at a comprehensive cancer center that sees more cases of soft tissue sarcoma to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment, and to help prevent the cancer from recurring.	general
Epithelioid sarcoma can be difficult to diagnose because it may be confused with other conditions that have similar signs.	general
For example, an ulcer on the skin that isn't healing could be mistaken for a skin infection.	general
Tests and procedures used in diagnosis of epithelioid include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically the method of imaging because of the level of detail it provides.	general
Sometimes other imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET), may be used.	general
The doctor performs a biopsy using a long, thin needle to remove a sample of the suspected sarcoma or a larger lump for testing in a lab.	general
Sometimes a biopsy sample is removed during surgery.	general
A pathologist analyzes the sample to determine whether it's cancer, and if so, the type and whether it's aggressive.	general
Surgery is the most common treatment for epithelioid sarcoma, but other treatments may be used in addition to surgery.	general
Surgery generally involves removing the cancer and a margin of healthy tissue surrounding it to help prevent recurrence.	general
In severe cases, depending on the size, depth and location of the cancer, there's a rare possibility that part of the affected limb would need to be amputated, but surgeons try their best to avoid doing this.	general
Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells.	general
Radiation therapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink the tumor and reduce the risk of the cancer returning, and after surgery to help reduce the risk of recurrence.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells.	general
Chemotherapy appears to be less effective in treating epithelioid sarcoma compared with other cancers, though it's sometimes used in addition to surgery or when the cancer has spread.	general
Chemotherapy.	general
Clinical trials are studies of new treatments.	general
These studies provide a chance to try the latest treatment options, but the risk of side effects may not be known.	general
Targeted cancer therapies ‚Äî drugs or other substances that target certain molecules to block cancer growth ‚Äî show promise in the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma.	general
Ask your doctor about the availability of clinical trials, including the potential risks and benefits.	general
Clinical trials.	general
Parvovirus infection face rash Parvovirus infection face rash A bright red rash on the cheeks is a distinctive sign of parvovirus infection.	general
Parvovirus infection is a common and highly contagious childhood ailment ‚Äî sometimes called slapped-cheek disease because of the distinctive face rash that develops.	general
Parvovirus infection has also been known as fifth disease because, historically, it was one of five common childhood illnesses characterized by a rash.	general
In most children, parvovirus infection is mild and requires little treatment.	general
However, in some adults, the infection can be serious.	general
Parvovirus infection in some pregnant women can lead to serious health problems for the fetus.	general
Parvovirus infection is also more serious for people with some kinds of anemia or who have a compromised immune system.	general
Most people with parvovirus infection have no signs or symptoms.	general
When symptoms do appear, they vary greatly depending on the age of the person who has the disease.	general
Parvovirus symptoms in children Early signs and symptoms of parvovirus infection in children may include: Distinctive facial rash Several days after the appearance of early symptoms, a distinctive bright red facial rash may appear ‚Äî usually on both cheeks.	general
Eventually it may extend to the arms, trunk, thighs and buttocks, where the rash has a pink, lacy, slightly raised appearance.	general
The rash may be itchy, especially on the soles of the feet.	general
Generally, the rash occurs near the end of the illness.	general
It's possible to mistake the rash for other viral rashes or a medicine-related rash.	general
The rash may come and go for up to three weeks, becoming more visible when a child is exposed to extreme temperatures or spends time in the sun.	general
Parvovirus symptoms in adults Adults don't usually develop the slapped-cheek rash.	general
Instead, the most prominent symptom of parvovirus infection in adults is joint soreness, lasting days to weeks.	general
Joints most commonly affected are the hands, wrists, knees and ankles.	general
When to see a doctor Generally, you don't need to see a doctor for parvovirus infection.	general
But if you or your child has an underlying condition that may increase the risk of complications, make an appointment with your doctor.	general
These conditions include: Sickle cell anemia Impaired immune system The human parvovirus B19 causes parvovirus infection.	general
This is different from the parvovirus seen in dogs and cats, so you can't get the infection from a pet or vice versa.	general
Human parvovirus infection is most common among elementary school-age children during outbreaks in the winter and spring months, but anyone can become ill with it anytime of the year.	general
It spreads from person to person, just like a cold, often through respiratory secretions and hand-to-hand contact.	general
Parvovirus infection can also spread through blood.	general
A pregnant woman who is infected can pass the virus to her baby.	general
The illness is contagious in the week before the rash appears.	general
Once the rash appears, the person with the illness is no longer considered contagious and doesn't need to be isolated.	general
Complications Parvovirus and anemia Parvovirus infection can cause serious complications for people with anemia, a condition in which red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all the parts of your body, are used up faster than your bone marrow can replace them.	general
Parvovirus infection in people with anemia may stop the production of red blood cells and cause an anemia crisis.	general
People with sickle cell anemia are at particular risk.	general
Parvovirus can also cause anemia and related complications in: The unborn children of women infected with parvovirus during pregnancy People who have weakened immune systems Parvovirus infection in pregnancy Parvovirus infection during pregnancy sometimes affects red blood cells in the fetus.	general
Although uncommon, this may cause severe anemia that could lead to miscarriage or stillbirth.	general
Fetal risk appears greatest during the first half of the pregnancy.	general
Parvovirus in people with weakened immune systems Parvovirus infection can also trigger severe anemia in people who have compromised immune systems, which may result from: HIV infection Cancer treatments There's no vaccine to prevent human parvovirus infection.	general
Once you've become infected with parvovirus, you acquire lifelong immunity.	general
Washing your hands and your child's hands frequently, and not sharing food or drinks, may help diminish the chances of getting an infection.	general
Stevens-Johnson syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a serious adverse reaction of the skin and mucous membranes.	general
Signs and symptoms include blisters, rash and skin pain.	general
Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare, serious disorder of your skin and mucous membranes.	general
It's usually a reaction to a medication or an infection.	general
Often, it begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters.	general
Then the top layer of the affected skin dies, sheds and then heals.	general
Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a medical emergency that usually requires hospitalization.	general
Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying cause, controlling symptoms and minimizing complications as your skin regrows.	general
Recovery after Stevens-Johnson syndrome can take weeks to months, depending on the severity of your condition.	general
If it was caused by a medication, you'll need to permanently avoid that drug and others closely related to it.	general
A red or purple skin rash that spreads Blisters on your skin and the mucous membranes of your mouth, nose, eyes and genitals Shedding of your skin within days after blisters form If you have Stevens-Johnson syndrome, several days before the rash develops you may experience: Stevens-Johnson syndrome requires immediate medical attention.	general
Seek emergency medical care if you experience signs and symptoms of this condition.	general
Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare and unpredictable reaction.	general
Your doctor may not be able to identify its exact cause, but usually the condition is triggered by a medication or an infection.	general
A reaction to medication may start while you're using it or up to two weeks after you've stopped using it.	general
Medication and therapy causes Anti-gout medications, such as allopurinol Medications to treat seizures and mental illness (anticonvulsants and antipsychotics), with added risk if you also undergo radiation therapy; Pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) Medications to fight infection, such as penicillin Infectious causes Factors that increase your risk of developing Stevens-Johnson syndrome include: Among people with HIV, the incidence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is about 100 times greater than among the general population.	general
An HIV infection.	general
If you have a weakened immune system, you may have an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.	general
Your immune system can be affected by an organ transplant, HIV/AIDS and autoimmune diseases.	general
A weakened immune system.	general
If you've had a medication-related form of this condition, you are at risk of a recurrence if you use that drug again.	general
A history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.	general
If an immediate family member has had Stevens-Johnson syndrome or a related condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis, you may be more susceptible to developing Stevens-Johnson syndrome too.	general
A family history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.	general
If you have a gene called HLA-B 1502, you have an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, particularly if you take certain drugs for seizures, gout or mental illness.	general
Families of Chinese, Southeast Asian or Indian descent are more likely to carry this gene.	general
The HLA-B*1502 gene.	general
Complications Cellulitis can lead to life-threatening complications, including sepsis.	general
Secondary skin infection (cellulitis).	general
Sepsis occurs when bacteria from an infection enter your bloodstream and spread throughout your body.	general
Sepsis is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening condition that can cause shock and organ failure.	general
Blood infection (sepsis).	general
The rash caused by Stevens-Johnson syndrome can lead to inflammation in your eyes.	general
In mild cases, this may cause irritation and dry eyes.	general
In severe cases, it can lead to extensive tissue damage and scarring that results in visual impairment and, rarely, blindness.	general
Eye problems.	general
The condition may lead to acute respiratory failure.	general
Lung involvement.	general
When your skin grows back following Stevens-Johnson syndrome, it may have abnormal bumps and coloring.	general
And you may have scars.	general
Lasting skin problems may cause your hair to fall out, and your fingernails and toenails may not grow normally.	general
Permanent skin damage.	general
If you are of Chinese, Southeast Asian or Indian descent, talk with your doctor before taking carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol).	general
This drug is useful to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder and other conditions.	general
But people with a gene called HLA-B*1502 have an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome if they take this drug.	general
Consider genetic testing before taking certain drugs.	general
.	general
If you've had Stevens-Johnson syndrome and your doctor told you it was caused by a medication, avoid that drug and others like it.	general
This is key to preventing a recurrence, which is usually more severe than the first episode and can be fatal.	general
If you've had this condition, avoid the medication that triggered it Your family members also might want to avoid this drug because some forms of this condition have a genetic risk factor.	general
The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects your mouth and your stomach.	general
Rings of muscle (sphincters) in the upper and lower portions contract and relax to allow food and liquid to pass.	general
Esophageal spasms are painful contractions within the muscular tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus).	general
Esophageal spasms can feel like sudden, severe chest pain that lasts from a few minutes to hours.	general
Esophageal spasms typically occur only occasionally and might not need treatment.	general
But sometimes the spasms are frequent and can prevent food and liquids from traveling through the esophagus.	general
If esophageal spasms interfere with your ability to eat or drink, treatments are available.	general
Signs and symptoms of esophageal spasms include: Squeezing pain in your chest.	general
The pain is often intense, and you might mistake it for heart pain (angina).	general
Difficulty swallowing, sometimes related to swallowing specific substances, such as red wine or extremely hot or cold liquids.	general
The feeling that an object is stuck in your throat.	general
The return of food and liquids back up your esophagus (regurgitation).	general
When to see a doctor The squeezing chest pain associated with esophageal spasms can also be caused by a heart attack.	general
If you experience squeezing chest pain, seek immediate medical care.	general
It's not clear what causes esophageal spasms.	general
However, they appear to be related to abnormal functioning of nerves that control the muscles you use when you swallow.	general
A healthy esophagus normally moves food into your stomach through a series of coordinated muscle contractions.	general
Esophageal spasms make it difficult for the muscles in the walls of your lower esophagus to coordinate in order to move food to your stomach.	general
There are two types of esophageal spasms: This type of spasm may be painful and is often accompanied by regurgitation of food or liquids.	general
Occasional contractions (diffuse esophageal spasms).	general
Although painful, this type of spasm ‚Äî also referred to as jackhammer esophagus ‚Äî may not cause regurgitation of food or liquids.	general
Painfully strong contractions (nutcracker esophagus).	general
Risk factors Esophageal spasms are a rare condition.	general
They tend to occur in people between the ages of 60 and 80, and may be associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).	general
Esophageal varices Esophageal varices Esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus.	general
They're often due to obstructed blood flow through the portal vein, which carries blood from the intestine, pancreas and spleen to the liver.	general
Esophageal varices are abnormal, enlarged veins in the tube that connects the throat and stomach (esophagus).	general
This condition occurs most often in people with serious liver diseases.	general
Esophageal varices develop when normal blood flow to the liver is blocked by a clot or scar tissue in the liver.	general
To go around the blockages, blood flows into smaller blood vessels that aren't designed to carry large volumes of blood.	general
The vessels can leak blood or even rupture, causing life-threatening bleeding.	general
A number of drugs and medical procedures can help prevent or stop bleeding from esophageal varices.	general
Esophageal varices usually don't cause signs and symptoms unless they bleed.	general
Signs and symptoms of bleeding esophageal varices include: Vomiting large amounts of blood Black, tarry or bloody stools Lightheadedness Loss of consciousness in severe cases Your doctor might suspect esophageal varices if you have signs of liver disease, including: Yellow coloration of your skin and eyes (jaundice) Easy bleeding or bruising When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
If you've been diagnosed with liver disease, ask your doctor about your risk of esophageal varices and what you can do to reduce your risk.	general
Also ask your doctor whether you should get a procedure to check for esophageal varices.	general
If you've been diagnosed with esophageal varices, your doctor is likely to instruct you to watch for signs of bleeding.	general
Bleeding esophageal varices are an emergency.	general
Call 911 or your local emergency services right away if you have bloody vomit or bloody stools.	general
Esophageal varices sometimes form when blood flow to your liver is blocked, most often by scar tissue in the liver caused by liver disease.	general
The blood flow begins to back up, increasing pressure within the large vein (portal vein) that carries blood to your liver.	general
This increased pressure (portal hypertension) forces the blood to seek other pathways through smaller veins, such as those in the lowest part of the esophagus.	general
These thin-walled veins balloon with the added blood.	general
Sometimes the veins rupture and bleed.	general
Causes of esophageal varices include: A number of liver diseases ‚Äî including hepatitis infection, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver disease and a bile duct disorder called primary biliary cirrhosis ‚Äî can result in cirrhosis.	general
Severe liver scarring (cirrhosis).	general
A blood clot in the portal vein or in a vein that feeds into the portal vein (splenic vein) can cause esophageal varices.	general
Blood clot (thrombosis).	general
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection found in parts of Africa, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and East Asia.	general
The parasite can damage the liver, as well as the lungs, intestine, bladder and other organs.	general
Parasitic infection.	general
Risk factors Although many people with advanced liver disease develop esophageal varices, most won't have bleeding.	general
Esophageal varices are more likely to bleed if you have: The risk of bleeding increases as the pressure in the portal vein increases (portal hypertension).	general
High portal vein pressure.	general
The larger the esophageal varices, the more likely they are to bleed.	general
Large varices.	general
When viewed through a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) passed down your throat, some esophageal varices show long, red streaks or red spots.	general
These marks indicate a high risk of bleeding.	general
Red marks on the varices.	general
Most often, the more severe your liver disease, the more likely esophageal varices are to bleed.	general
Severe cirrhosis or liver failure.	general
Your risk of variceal bleeding is far greater if you continue to drink than if you stop, especially if your disease is alcohol related.	general
Continued alcohol use.	general
If you've had bleeding from esophageal varices before, you're more likely to have varices that bleed again.	general
Complications The most serious complication of esophageal varices is bleeding.	general
Once you've had a bleeding episode, your risk of another bleeding episode greatly increases.	general
If you lose enough blood, you can go into shock, which can lead to death.	general
Currently, no treatment can prevent the development of esophageal varices in people with cirrhosis.	general
While beta blocker drugs are effective in preventing bleeding in many people who have esophageal varices, they don't prevent esophageal varices from forming.	general
If you've been diagnosed with liver disease, ask your doctor about strategies to avoid liver disease complications.	general
To keep your liver healthy: People with liver disease are often advised to stop drinking alcohol, since the liver processes alcohol.	general
Drinking alcohol may stress an already vulnerable liver.	general
Don't drink alcohol.	general
Choose a plant-based diet that's full of fruits and vegetables.	general
Select whole grains and lean sources of protein.	general
Reduce the amount of fatty and fried foods you eat.	general
Eat a healthy diet.	general
An excess amount of body fat can damage your liver.	general
Obesity is associated with a greater risk of complications of cirrhosis.	general
Lose weight if you are obese or overweight.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
Follow the directions on household chemicals, such as cleaning supplies and insect sprays.	general
If you work around chemicals, follow all safety precautions.	general
Your liver removes toxins from your body, so give it a break by limiting the amount of toxins it must process.	general
Use chemicals sparingly and carefully.	general
Sharing needles and having unprotected sex can increase your risk of hepatitis B and C. Protect yourself by abstaining from sex or using a condom if you choose to have sex.	general
Get tested for exposure to hepatitis A, B and C, since infection can make your liver disease worse.	general
Also ask your doctor whether you should be vaccinated for hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Reduce your risk of hepatitis.	general
Esophagitis (uh-sof-uh-JIE-tis) is inflammation that may damage tissues of the esophagus, the muscular tube that delivers food from your mouth to your stomach.	general
Esophagitis can cause painful, difficult swallowing and chest pain.	general
Causes of esophagitis include stomach acids backing up into the esophagus, infection, oral medications and allergies.	general
Treatment for esophagitis depends on the underlying cause and the severity of tissue damage.	general
If left untreated, esophagitis can damage the lining of the esophagus and interfere with its normal function, which is to move food and liquid from your mouth to your stomach.	general
Esophagitis can also lead to complications such as scarring or narrowing of the esophagus, and difficulty swallowing.	general
Difficult swallowing Painful swallowing Chest pain, particularly behind the breastbone, that occurs with eating Swallowed food becoming stuck in the esophagus (food impaction) Acid regurgitation In infants and young children, particularly those too young to explain their discomfort or pain, signs of esophagitis may include: Feeding difficulties When to see a doctor Most signs and symptoms of esophagitis can be caused by a number of different conditions affecting the digestive system.	general
See your doctor if signs or symptoms: Last more than a few days Don't improve or go away with over-the-counter antacids Are severe enough to make eating difficult Are accompanied by flu signs and symptoms, such as headache, fever and muscle aches Get emergency care if you: Experience pain in your chest that lasts more than a few minutes Suspect you have food lodged in your esophagus Have a history of heart disease and experience chest pain Experience pain in your mouth or throat when you eat Have shortness of breath or chest pain that occurs shortly after eating Vomit large amounts, often have forceful vomiting, have trouble breathing after vomiting or have vomit that is yellow or green, looks like coffee grounds, or contains blood Esophagitis is generally categorized by the conditions that cause it.	general
In some cases, more than one factor may be causing esophagitis.	general
Reflux esophagitis A valve-like structure called the lower esophageal sphincter usually keeps the acidic contents of the stomach out of the esophagus.	general
If this valve opens when it shouldn't or doesn't close properly, the contents of the stomach may back up into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux).	general
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which this backflow of acid is a frequent or ongoing problem.	general
A complication of GERD is chronic inflammation and tissue damage in the esophagus.	general
Eosinophilic esophagitis Eosinophils (e-o-SIN-o-fils) are white blood cells that play a key role in allergic reactions.	general
Eosinophilic esophagitis occurs with a high concentration of these white blood cells in the esophagus, most likely in response to an allergy-causing agent (allergen) or acid reflux or both.	general
In many cases, this type of esophagitis may be triggered by foods such as milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, beans, rye and beef.	general
However, conventional allergy testing does not reliably identify these culprit foods.	general
People with eosinophilic esophagitis may have other nonfood allergies.	general
For example, sometimes inhaled allergens, such as pollen, may be the cause.	general
Lymphocytic esophagitis Lymphocytic esophagitis (LE) is an uncommon esophageal condition in which there are an increased number of lymphocytes in the lining of the esophagus.	general
LE may be related to eosinophilic esophagitis or to GERD.	general
Drug-induced esophagitis Several oral medications may cause tissue damage if they remain in contact with the lining of the esophagus for too long.	general
For example, if you swallow a pill with little or no water, the pill itself or residue from the pill may remain in the esophagus.	general
Drugs that have been linked to esophagitis include: Pain-relieving medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) Antibiotics, such as tetracycline and doxycycline Potassium chloride, which is used to treat potassium deficiency Bisphosphonates, including alendronate (Fosamax), a treatment for weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis) Quinidine, which is used to treat heart problems Infectious esophagitis A bacterial, viral or fungal infection in tissues of the esophagus may cause esophagitis.	general
Infectious esophagitis is relatively rare and occurs most often in people with poor immune system function, such as people with HIV/AIDS or cancer.	general
A fungus normally present in the mouth called Candida albicans is a common cause of infectious esophagitis.	general
Such infections are often associated with poor immune system function, diabetes, cancer, or the use of steroid or antibiotic medications.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for esophagitis vary depending on the different causes of the disorder.	general
Reflux esophagitis Factors that increase the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) ‚Äî and therefore are factors in reflux esophagitis ‚Äî include the following: Eating immediately before going to bed Dietary factors such as excess alcohol, caffeine, chocolate and mint-flavored foods Excessively large and fatty meals Extra weight, including from pregnancy A number of foods may worsen symptoms of GERD or reflux esophagitis: Tomato-based foods Citrus fruits Risk factors for eosinophilic esophagitis, or allergy-related esophagitis, may include: A history of certain allergic reactions, including allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis A family history of eosinophilic esophagitis Drug-induced esophagitis Factors that may increase the risk of drug-induced esophagitis are generally related to issues that prevent quick and complete passage of a pill into the stomach.	general
These factors include: Swallowing a pill with little or no water Taking drugs while lying down Taking drugs right before sleep, probably due in part to the production of less saliva and swallowing less during sleep Older age, possibly because of age-related changes to the muscles of the esophagus or a decreased production of saliva Large or oddly shaped pills Infectious esophagitis Risk factors for infectious esophagitis often relate to medications, such as steroids and antibiotics.	general
People with diabetes also are at increased risk of candida esophagitis in particular.	general
Other causes of infectious esophagitis may relate to poor immune system function.	general
This may be due to an immune disorder, HIV/AIDS or certain cancers.	general
Also, certain cancer treatments and drugs that block immune system reactions to transplanted organs (immunosuppressants) may increase the risk of infectious esophagitis.	general
Complications Left untreated, esophagitis can lead to changes in the structure of the esophagus.	general
Essential thrombocythemia is an uncommon disorder in which your body produces too many blood platelets.	general
This condition may cause you to feel fatigued and lightheaded and to experience headaches and vision changes.	general
It also increases your risk of blood clots.	general
Essential thrombocythemia (throm-boe-sie-THEE-me-uh) is more common in people over age 50, though younger people can develop it too.	general
It's somewhat more common in women.	general
Essential thrombocythemia is a chronic disease with no cure.	general
If you have a mild form of the disease, you may not need treatment.	general
If you have a severe condition, you may need medicine that lowers your platelet count, blood thinners or both.	general
You may not have any noticeable symptoms of essential thrombocythemia.	general
The first indication you have the disorder may be the development of a blood clot (thrombus).	general
Clots can develop anywhere in your body, but with essential thrombocythemia they occur most often in your brain, hands and feet.	general
Signs and symptoms depend on where the clot forms.	general
They include: Numbness or tingling of the hands and feet Redness, throbbing and burning pain in the hands and feet (erythromelalgia) Less commonly, essential thrombocythemia may cause bleeding, especially if your platelet count is extremely high (more than 1 million platelets per microliter of blood).	general
Bleeding may take the form of: Bloody stool If a blood clot occurs in the arteries that supply the brain, it may cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.	general
A TIA, or ministroke, is a temporary interruption of blood flow to part of the brain.	general
Signs and symptoms of a stroke or TIA develop suddenly and include: Weakness or numbness of your face, arm or leg, usually on one side of your body Difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia)> Blurred, double or decreased vision When to see a doctor Seek medical attention immediately: If you develop signs or symptoms of a TIA or stroke, such as numbness or paralysis on one side of your body If you develop signs or symptoms of a heart attack, such as pressure, fullness or a squeezing pain in the center of your chest lasting more than a few minutes; pain extending to your shoulder, arm, back, teeth or jaw; shortness of breath; and sweating or clammy skin.	general
If you have any signs or symptoms of abnormal blood clotting or bleeding Essential thrombocythemia is a type of chronic myeloproliferative disorder.	general
That means the bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside your bones, makes too many of a certain type of cell.	general
In the case of essential thrombocythemia, the bone marrow makes too many cells that create platelets.	general
It's not clear what causes this to happen.	general
About 90 percent of people with the disorder have an acquired gene mutation contributing to the disease.	general
Platelets stick together to help form blood clots.	general
Normally, blood clots stop bleeding when you damage a blood vessel, such as when you get a cut.	general
A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.	general
Someone with essential thrombocythemia has more than 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.	general
Plus, the excess platelets may not function normally, leading to abnormal clotting or bleeding.	general
If an underlying condition such as an infection or iron deficiency causes a high platelet count, it's called reactive, or secondary, thrombocythemia.	general
Secondary thrombocythemia causes less risk of blood clots and bleeding than does essential thrombocythemia.	general
Complications Older people with essential thrombocythemia are at risk of complications.	general
People who've had prior blood clots or bleeding problems related to the disease are also at risk of complications.	general
The abnormal blood clotting of essential thrombocythemia can lead to a variety of potentially serious complications, including: A clot that blocks blood flow to your brain can cause a stroke.	general
If you develop signs and symptoms of a stroke, get immediate medical attention.	general
Blood clots that obstruct blood flow to your heart cause heart attacks.	general
Get immediate attention if you develop signs and symptoms of a heart attack.	general
Heart attack.	general
This may appear as nosebleeds, bleeding gums or bruising.	general
Excessive bleeding.	general
Rarely, essential thrombocythemia may progress to these potentially life-threatening diseases: This is a type of white blood cell and bone marrow cancer that progresses rapidly.	general
Acute myelogenous leukemia.	general
This progressive disorder results in bone marrow scarring, leading to severe anemia and enlargement of your liver and spleen.	general
Myelofibrosis.	general
Pregnancy complications Pregnant women with essential thrombocythemia have a higher risk of complications than women without the condition.	general
But most women who have thrombocythemia have normal, healthy pregnancies.	general
However, uncontrolled thrombocythemia can lead to miscarriage and other complications.	general
Your risk of complications may be reduced with regular checkups and medication, so be sure to have your doctor regularly monitor your condition.	general
Essential tremor is a nervous system (neurological) disorder that causes involuntary and rhythmic shaking.	general
It can affect almost any part of your body, but the trembling occurs most often in your hands ‚Äî especially when you do simple tasks, such as drinking from a glass or tying shoelaces.	general
Essential tremor is usually not a dangerous condition, but it typically worsens over time and can be severe in some people.	general
Other conditions don't cause essential tremor, although essential tremor is sometimes confused with Parkinson's disease.	general
Essential tremor can occur at any age but is most common in people age 40 and older.	general
"Essential tremor signs and symptoms: Begin gradually, usually more prominently on one side of the body Worsen with movement Usually occur in the hands first, affecting one hand or both hands Can include a ""yes-yes"" or ""no-no"" motion of the head May be aggravated by emotional stress, fatigue, caffeine or temperature extremes Essential tremor vs."	general
Parkinson's disease Many people associate tremors with Parkinson's disease, but the two conditions differ in key ways: Essential tremor of the hands usually occurs when you use your hands.	general
Tremors from Parkinson's disease are most prominent when your hands are at your sides or resting in your lap.	general
Timing of tremors.	general
Essential tremor doesn't cause other health problems, but Parkinson's disease is associated with stooped posture, slow movement and shuffling gait.	general
However, people with essential tremor sometimes develop other neurological signs and symptoms, such as an unsteady gait (ataxia).	general
Associated conditions.	general
Essential tremor mainly involves your hands, head and voice.	general
Parkinson's disease tremors usually start in your hands, and can affect your legs, chin and other parts of your body.	general
Parts of body affected.	general
About half of essential tremor cases appear to result from a genetic mutation.	general
This form is referred to as familial tremor.	general
It isn't clear what causes essential tremor in people without a known genetic mutation.	general
Risk factors Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern In an autosomal dominant disorder, the mutated gene is a dominant gene located on one of the nonsex chromosomes (autosomes).	general
You need only one mutated gene to be affected by this type of disorder.	general
A person with an autosomal dominant disorder ‚Äî in this case, the father ‚Äî has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one mutated gene (dominant gene) and a 50% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes (recessive genes).	general
Known risk factors for essential tremor include: The inherited variety of essential tremor (familial tremor) is an autosomal dominant disorder.	general
A defective gene from just one parent is needed to pass on the condition.	general
Genetic mutation.	general
If you have a parent with a genetic mutation for essential tremor, you have a 50 percent chance of developing the disorder yourself.	general
Essential tremor is more common in people age 40 and older.	general
Complications Essential tremor isn't life-threatening, but symptoms often worsen over time.	general
Esthesioneuroblastoma (es-thee-zee-o-noo-row-blas-TOE-muh) is a rare type of cancer that begins in the upper portion of the nasal cavity.	general
The area where esthesioneuroblastoma begins is separated from the brain by a bone that contains tiny holes that allow the nerves that control smell (olfactory nerves) to pass through.	general
Esthesioneuroblastoma is also called olfactory neuroblastoma.	general
Esthesioneuroblastoma, which can occur at any age in adults, generally begins as a tumor in the nasal cavity and may grow or extend into the sinus, eyes and brain.	general
People with esthesioneuroblastoma can lose their sense of smell, have frequent nosebleeds and experience difficulty breathing through their nostrils as the tumor grows.	general
Esthesioneuroblastoma can also spread to the lymph nodes in the neck and the parotid glands.	general
In advanced cases, esthesioneuroblastoma can spread to other parts of the brain and other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver and bones.	general
Esthesioneuroblastoma treatment usually includes surgery.	general
Often, radiation and chemotherapy are recommended, as well.	general
Frequent nosebleeds Difficulty breathing through the nose As it grows, the cancer may cause eye pain, loss of vision, ear pain and headaches.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that concern you.	general
The exact cause of esthesioneuroblastoma has not been found.	general
In general, cancer begins with a genetic mutation that allows normal, healthy cells to continue growing without responding to the signals to stop, which is unlike what normal cells do.	general
Cancer cells grow and multiply out of control.	general
The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor).	general
Complications Complications of esthesioneuroblastoma may include: Advanced esthesioneuroblastoma can cause complications if it grows large enough to invade nearby structures, such as the eyes and brain.	general
Cancer that grows to invade nearby structures.	general
Esthesioneuroblastoma may spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, lungs, liver, skin and bones.	general
Spread of the cancer (metastasis).	general
The tumor can obstruct the nasal passage, which can block the flow of air through the nose.	general
Loss of the sense of smell.	general
These complications can include spinal fluid leakage, infection, vision problems, and abscess.	general
Complications from surgery.	general
Ewing (YOO-ing) sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that occurs in bones or in the soft tissue around the bones.	general
This cancer most often begins in the long bones of the pelvis, legs or arms, but it can occur in any bone.	general
Less often, Ewing sarcoma starts in the soft tissues of the arms, legs, abdomen or other locations.	general
Major advancements in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma have significantly improved outcomes.	general
After completion of treatment, people need lifelong monitoring for potential late effects of intense chemotherapy and radiation.	general
Ewing sarcoma is more common in teenagers and young adults, but it can occur at any age.	general
Pain, swelling or tenderness near the affected area Bone pain, which may worsen at night or with physical activity Unexplained tiredness Unintended weight loss The cause of Ewing sarcoma is unknown.	general
Though Ewing sarcoma arises from specific types of cells, it doesn't appear to be inherited.	general
Risk factors Complications Ewing sarcoma can spread from where it started to other areas, making treatment and recovery more difficult.	general
For example, the cancer can spread to other tissues, bone marrow, other bones or to the lungs.	general
Ewing sarcoma can also return after treatment.	general
As with other types of serious cancer, aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for Ewing sarcoma can cause substantial side effects, both in the short and long term.	general
The health care team takes steps to treat and manage these effects as best as possible.	general
And it's important for you to learn what to watch for and contact your team with any concerns.	general
Ewing sarcoma can't be prevented.	general
This type of cancer is not inherited and there is no known link to any lifestyle or environmental issues.	general
Any signs or symptoms should be checked out as soon as possible.	general
Hirsutism is excess hair most often noticeable around the mouth and chin.	general
Hirsutism (HUR-soot-iz-um) is a condition in women that results in excessive growth of dark or coarse hair in a male-like pattern ‚Äî face, chest and back.	general
With hirsutism, extra hair growth often arises from excess male hormones (androgens), primarily testosterone.	general
Self-care methods and effective treatment options are available for women who wish to treat hirsutism.	general
Hirsutism is stiff or dark body hair, appearing on the body where women don't commonly have hair ‚Äî primarily the face, chest, lower abdomen, inner thighs and back.	general
People have widely varying opinions on what's considered excessive.	general
When high androgen levels cause hirsutism, other signs might develop over time, a process called virilization.	general
Signs of virilization might include: Deepening voice When to see a doctor If you think you have too much coarse hair on your face or body, talk with your doctor about treatment options.	general
Excess facial or body hair is often a symptom of an underlying medical problem.	general
See your doctor for assessment if over a few months you experience severe or rapid hair growth on your face or body or signs of virilization.	general
You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in hormone disorders (endocrinologist) or skin problems (dermatologist).	general
Hirsutism may be caused by: This condition, which often begins with puberty, causes an imbalance of sex hormones.	general
Over years, may slowly result in excess hair growth, irregular periods, obesity, infertility and sometimes multiple cysts on the ovaries.	general
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).	general
This occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol.	general
It can develop from your adrenal glands making too much cortisol or from taking medications such as prednisone over a long period.	general
Cushing syndrome.	general
This inherited condition is characterized by abnormal production of steroid hormones, including cortisol and androgen, by your adrenal glands.	general
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.	general
Rarely, an androgen-secreting tumor in the ovaries or adrenal glands can cause hirsutism.	general
Some medications can cause hirsutism.	general
These include minoxidil (Minoxidil, Rogaine); danazol, which is used to treat women with endometriosis; testosterone (Androgel, Testim); and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).	general
If your partner uses topical products containing androgens, you can be affected as well, through skin-to-skin contact.	general
Medications.	general
Often hirsutism occurs with no identifiable cause.	general
Risk factors Several factors can influence your likelihood of developing hirsutism, including: Several conditions that cause hirsutism, including congenital adrenal hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome, run in families.	general
Family history.	general
Women of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and South Asian ancestry are more likely to have more body hair with no identifiable cause than are other women.	general
Being obese causes increased androgen production, which can worsen hirsutism.	general
Complications Hirsutism can be emotionally distressing.	general
Some women feel self-conscious about having unwanted hair.	general
Some develop depression.	general
Also, although hirsutism doesn't cause physical complications, the underlying cause of a hormonal imbalance can.	general
If you have hirsutism and irregular periods, you might have polycystic ovary syndrome, which can inhibit fertility.	general
Women who take certain medications to treat hirsutism should avoid pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.	general
Hirsutism generally isn't preventable.	general
But losing weight if you're overweight might help reduce hirsutism, particularly if you have polycystic ovary syndrome.	general
Menorrhagia is the medical term for menstrual periods with abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding.	general
Although heavy menstrual bleeding is a common concern, most women don't experience blood loss severe enough to be defined as menorrhagia.	general
With menorrhagia, you can't maintain your usual activities when you have your period because you have so much blood loss and cramping.	general
If you dread your period because you have such heavy menstrual bleeding, talk with your doctor.	general
There are many effective treatments for menorrhagia.	general
Signs and symptoms of menorrhagia may include: Soaking through one or more sanitary pads or tampons every hour for several consecutive hours Needing to use double sanitary protection to control your menstrual flow Needing to wake up to change sanitary protection during the night Bleeding for longer than a week Passing blood clots larger than a quarter Restricting daily activities due to heavy menstrual flow Symptoms of anemia, such as tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath When to see a doctor Seek medical help before your next scheduled exam if you experience: Vaginal bleeding so heavy it soaks at least one pad or tampon an hour for more than two hours Bleeding between periods or irregular vaginal bleeding Any vaginal bleeding after menopause More Information Fibroid locations Fibroid locations Intramural fibroids grow within the muscular uterine wall.	general
Submucosal fibroids bulge into the uterine cavity.	general
Subserosal fibroids project to the outside of the uterus.	general
Some subserosal or submucosal fibroids may be pedunculated ‚Äî hanging from a stalk inside or outside the uterus.	general
Uterine polyps Uterine polyps Uterine polyps attach to your uterus by a large base or a thin stalk and can grow to be several centimeters in size.	general
Irregular menstrual bleeding, bleeding after menopause, excessively heavy menstrual flow or bleeding between periods could signal the presence of uterine polyps.	general
Adenomyosis Adenomyosis With adenomyosis, the same tissue that lines the uterus (endometrial tissue) is present within and grows into the muscular walls of your uterus.	general
In some cases, the cause of heavy menstrual bleeding is unknown, but a number of conditions may cause menorrhagia.	general
Common causes include: In a normal menstrual cycle, a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone regulates the buildup of the lining of the uterus (endometrium), which is shed during menstruation.	general
If a hormone imbalance occurs, the endometrium develops in excess and eventually sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding.	general
Hormone imbalance.	general
A number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obesity, insulin resistance and thyroid problems.	general
If your ovaries don't release an egg (ovulate) during a menstrual cycle (anovulation), your body doesn't produce the hormone progesterone, as it would during a normal menstrual cycle.	general
This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in menorrhagia.	general
Dysfunction of the ovaries.	general
These noncancerous (benign) tumors of the uterus appear during your childbearing years.	general
Uterine fibroids may cause heavier than normal or prolonged menstrual bleeding.	general
Uterine fibroids.	general
Small, benign growths on the lining of the uterus (uterine polyps) may cause heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.	general
This condition occurs when glands from the endometrium become embedded in the uterine muscle, often causing heavy bleeding and painful periods.	general
Adenomyosis.	general
Menorrhagia is a well-known side effect of using a nonhormonal intrauterine device for birth control.	general
Your doctor will help you plan for alternative management options.	general
Intrauterine device (IUD).	general
A single, heavy, late period may be due to a miscarriage.	general
Another cause of heavy bleeding during pregnancy includes an unusual location of the placenta, such as a low-lying placenta or placenta previa.	general
Pregnancy complications.	general
Uterine cancer and cervical cancer can cause excessive menstrual bleeding, especially if you are postmenopausal or have had an abnormal Pap test in the past.	general
Some bleeding disorders ‚Äî such as von Willebrand's disease, a condition in which an important blood-clotting factor is deficient or impaired ‚Äî can cause abnormal menstrual bleeding.	general
Inherited bleeding disorders.	general
Certain medications, including anti-inflammatory medications, hormonal medications such as estrogen and progestins, and anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) or enoxaparin (Lovenox), can contribute to heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.	general
Medications.	general
A number of other medical conditions, including liver or kidney disease, may be associated with menorrhagia.	general
Other medical conditions.	general
Risk factors Risk factors vary with age and whether you have other medical conditions that may explain your menorrhagia.	general
In a normal cycle, the release of an egg from the ovaries stimulates the body's production of progesterone, the female hormone most responsible for keeping periods regular.	general
When no egg is released, insufficient progesterone can cause heavy menstrual bleeding.	general
Menorrhagia in adolescent girls is typically due to anovulation.	general
Adolescent girls are especially prone to anovulatory cycles in the first year after their first menstrual period (menarche).	general
Menorrhagia in older reproductive-age women is typically due to uterine pathology, including fibroids, polyps and adenomyosis.	general
However, other problems, such as uterine cancer, bleeding disorders, medication side effects and liver or kidney disease must be ruled out.	general
Complications Excessive or prolonged menstrual bleeding can lead to other medical conditions, including: Menorrhagia can cause blood loss anemia by reducing the number of circulating red blood cells.	general
The number of circulating red blood cells is measured by hemoglobin, a protein that enables red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues.	general
Iron deficiency anemia occurs as your body attempts to make up for the lost red blood cells by using your iron stores to make more hemoglobin, which can then carry oxygen on red blood cells.	general
Menorrhagia may decrease iron levels enough to increase the risk of iron deficiency anemia.	general
Signs and symptoms include pale skin, weakness and fatigue.	general
Although diet plays a role in iron deficiency anemia, the problem is complicated by heavy menstrual periods.	general
Along with heavy menstrual bleeding, you might have painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea).	general
Sometimes the cramps associated with menorrhagia are severe enough to require medical evaluation.	general
Severe pain.	general
Exercise headaches occur during or after sustained, strenuous exercise.	general
Some activities associated with exercise headaches include running, rowing, tennis, swimming and weightlifting.	general
Doctors divide exercise headaches into two categories.	general
Primary exercise headaches are usually harmless, aren't connected to any underlying problems and can often be prevented with medication.	general
Secondary exercise headaches are caused by an underlying, often serious problem within the brain ‚Äî such as bleeding or a tumor ‚Äî or outside the brain ‚Äî such as coronary artery disease.	general
Secondary exercise headaches may require emergency medical attention.	general
Products & Services Occur during or after strenuous exercise Affect both sides of the head in most cases Secondary exercise headaches Double vision Neck rigidity Primary exercise headaches typically last between five minutes and 48 hours, while secondary exercise headaches usually last at least a day and sometimes linger for several days or longer.	general
When to see a doctor If you experience a headache during or after exercise, consult your doctor.	general
Call your doctor right away if the headache begins abruptly or if it's your first headache of this type.	general
Primary exercise headaches The exact cause of primary exercise headaches is unknown.	general
One theory is that strenuous exercise dilates blood vessels inside the skull.	general
Secondary exercise headaches Secondary exercise headaches are caused by an underlying problem, such as: Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin membranes that cover the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) Abnormalities in a blood vessel leading to or within the brain Cancerous or noncancerous tumors Sinus infection Risk factors You may be at greater risk of exercise headaches if you: Exercise in hot weather Exercise at high altitude Exercise headaches tend to occur more often when the weather is hot and humid, or if you're exercising at high altitudes.	general
If you're prone to exercise headaches, you may want to avoid exercising in these conditions.	general
Some people experience exercise headaches only during the performance of certain activities, so they may prevent their headaches by avoiding these activities.	general
A warm-up prior to strenuous exercise also can help prevent exercise headaches.	general
External compression headaches can occur when something worn on your head puts continuous pressure on your forehead or scalp.	general
They often occur in people required to wear certain headwear, such as helmets or goggles, for their work or sports activities.	general
"Sometimes an external compression headache is called ""swim-goggle headache"" or ""football-helmet headache"" or another name that refers to the equipment causing the headache."	general
People likely to get external compression headaches include construction workers, people in the military, police officers and athletes.	general
People who wear tight hats and headbands also might get this type of headache.	general
The solution to an external compression headache is as obvious as the cause.	general
Simply remove the headwear causing the pressure.	general
Products & Services The pain of external compression headaches is often described as moderate, constant pressure.	general
It hurts most in the area where the object is pressing on your head.	general
The pain might worsen the longer the headwear is worn.	general
When to see a doctor It's usually not necessary to see a doctor for a compression headache because it goes away, usually within an hour of removing whatever is causing the pressure.	general
Seek medical attention only if your headache continues after you remove the object.	general
External compression headaches are caused by headwear that places pressure on the head ‚Äî including tight hats, helmets, headbands and goggles.	general
The headaches are believed to result from pressure on pain receptors or pain fibers that transmit sensation from the face to the brain (trigeminal nerve) or on nerves in the back of the head (occipital nerves).	general
Risk factors Complications With prolonged pressure, an external compression headache might trigger a migraine in people who tend to have them.	general
To prevent external compression headaches, avoid unnecessary headwear.	general
If protective headwear, such as a sports or construction helmet, is necessary, make sure it fits properly and is positioned correctly.	general
Try various styles and sizes to find the most comfortable options.	general
Also, if possible, remove headwear frequently to give yourself a break from the pressure.	general
Eye floaters Eye floaters As you age, the vitreous ‚Äî a jelly-like material inside your eyes ‚Äî becomes more liquid.	general
When this happens, microscopic collagen fibers within the vitreous tend to clump together.	general
These bits of debris cast tiny shadows onto your retina, and you perceive these shadows as eye floaters.	general
Eye floaters are spots in your vision.	general
They may look to you like black or gray specks, strings, or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes and appear to dart away when you try to look at them directly.	general
Most eye floaters are caused by age-related changes that occur as the jelly-like substance (vitreous) inside your eyes becomes more liquid.	general
Microscopic fibers within the vitreous tend to clump and can cast tiny shadows on your retina.	general
The shadows you see are called floaters.	general
If you notice a sudden increase in eye floaters, contact an eye specialist immediately ‚Äî especially if you also see light flashes or lose your peripheral vision.	general
These can be symptoms of an emergency that requires prompt attention.	general
Symptoms of eye floaters may include: Small shapes in your vision that appear as dark specks or knobby, transparent strings of floating material Spots that move when you move your eyes, so when you try to look at them, they move quickly out of your visual field Spots that are most noticeable when you look at a plain bright background, such as a blue sky or a white wall Small shapes or strings that eventually settle down and drift out of the line of vision When to see a doctor Contact an eye specialist immediately if you notice: Many more eye floaters than usual A sudden onset of new floaters Flashes of light in the same eye as the floaters Darkness on any side or sides of your vision (peripheral vision loss) These painless symptoms could be caused by a retinal tear, with or without a retinal detachment ‚Äî a sight-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.	general
Mayo Clinic Minute: What are eye floaters?	general
Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: What are eye floaters?	general
Having vision problems?	general
Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes?	general
It could be eye floaters.	general
"""In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called 'the vitreous."	general
' When we're young, it's a firm clump of jelly.	general
As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces.	general
"Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floaters,"" says Dr. Khan."	general
Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you're nearsighted.	general
The biggest concern ‚Äì they can cause retinal tears.	general
"""If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall,"" says Dr. Khan."	general
"""And that's a retinal detachment""."	general
And that can cause blindness, which is why it's especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision.	general
Most eye floaters don't require treatment, but your eye doctor likely will recommend regular eye exams to ensure the condition doesn't worsen.	general
Retinal detachment Retinal detachment Retinal detachment describes an emergency situation in which a thin layer of tissue (the retina) at the back of the eye pulls away from the layer of blood vessels that provides it with oxygen and nutrients.	general
Retinal detachment is often accompanied by flashes and floaters in your vision.	general
Eye floaters may be caused by the normal aging process or as a result from other diseases or conditions: As you age, the vitreous, or jelly-like substance filling your eyeballs and helping them to maintain their round shape, changes.	general
Over time, the vitreous partially liquefies ‚Äî a process that causes it to pull away from the eyeball's interior surface.	general
As the vitreous shrinks and sags, it clumps and gets stringy.	general
This debris blocks some of the light passing through the eye, casting tiny shadows on your retina that are seen as floaters.	general
Age-related eye changes.	general
Posterior uveitis is inflammation in the layers of the uvea in the back of the eye.	general
This condition can cause the release of inflammatory debris into the vitreous that are seen as floaters.	general
Posterior uveitis may be caused by infection, inflammatory diseases or other causes.	general
Inflammation in the back of the eye.	general
Bleeding into the vitreous can have many causes, including diabetes, hypertension, blocked blood vessels and injury.	general
Blood cells are seen as floaters.	general
Bleeding in the eye.	general
Retinal tears can occur when a sagging vitreous tugs on the retina with enough force to tear it.	general
Without treatment, a retinal tear may lead to retinal detachment ‚Äî an accumulation of fluid behind the retina that causes it to separate from the back of your eye.	general
Untreated retinal detachment can cause permanent vision loss.	general
Torn retina.	general
Certain medications that are injected into the vitreous can cause air bubbles to form.	general
These bubbles are seen as shadows until your eye absorbs them.	general
Certain vitreoretinal surgeries add silicone oil bubbles into the vitreous that can also be seen as floaters.	general
Eye surgeries and eye medications.	general
Eyestrain is a common condition that occurs when your eyes get tired from intense use, such as while driving long distances or staring at computer screens and other digital devices.	general
Eyestrain can be annoying.	general
But it usually isn't serious and goes away once you rest your eyes or take other steps to reduce your eye discomfort.	general
In some cases, signs and symptoms of eyestrain can indicate an underlying eye condition that needs treatment.	general
Products & Services Sore, tired, burning or itching eyes Watery or dry eyes Blurred or double vision Increased sensitivity to light When to see a doctor See your doctor if self-care steps don't relieve your eyestrain.	general
Reading without pausing to rest your eyes Driving long distances and doing other activities involving extended focus Being exposed to bright light or glare Straining to see in very dim light Having an underlying eye problem, such as dry eyes or uncorrected vision (refractive error) Being stressed or fatigued Being exposed to dry moving air from a fan, heating or air-conditioning system Computer and digital device use Extended use of computers and other digital devices is one of the most common causes of eyestrain.	general
The American Optometric Association calls this computer vision syndrome, or digital eyestrain.	general
People who look at screens two or more hours in a row every day have the greatest risk of this condition.	general
Computer use strains eyes more than reading print material because people tend to: Blink less while using computers (blinking is key to moistening the eyes) View digital screens at less than ideal distances or angles Use devices that have glare or reflection Use devices with poor contrast between the text and the background In some cases, an underlying eye problem, such as eye muscle imbalance or uncorrected vision, can cause or worsen computer eyestrain.	general
Some other factors that can make the condition worse include: Glare on your screen Setup of your computer workstation Circulating air, such as from air conditioning or a nearby fan Complications Eyestrain doesn't have serious or long-term consequences, but it can be aggravating and unpleasant.	general
It can make you tired and reduce your ability to concentrate.	general
Factitious disorder is a serious mental disorder in which someone deceives others by appearing sick, by purposely getting sick or by self-injury.	general
Factitious disorder also can happen when family members or caregivers falsely present others, such as children, as being ill, injured or impaired.	general
Factitious disorder symptoms can range from mild (slight exaggeration of symptoms) to severe (previously called Munchausen syndrome).	general
The person may make up symptoms or even tamper with medical tests to convince others that treatment, such as high-risk surgery, is needed.	general
Factitious disorder is not the same as inventing medical problems for practical benefit, such as getting out of work or winning a lawsuit.	general
Although people with factitious disorder know they are causing their symptoms or illnesses, they may not understand the reasons for their behaviors or recognize themselves as having a problem.	general
Factitious disorder is challenging to identify and hard to treat.	general
However, medical and psychiatric help are critical for preventing serious injury and even death caused by the self-harm typical of this disorder.	general
Factitious disorder symptoms involve mimicking or producing illness or injury or exaggerating symptoms or impairment to deceive others.	general
People with the disorder go to great lengths to hide their deception, so it may be difficult to realize that their symptoms are actually part of a serious mental health disorder.	general
They continue with the deception, even without receiving any visible benefit or reward or when faced with objective evidence that doesn't support their claims.	general
Factitious disorder signs and symptoms may include: Clever and convincing medical or psychological problems Extensive knowledge of medical terms and diseases Vague or inconsistent symptoms Conditions that don't respond as expected to standard therapies Seeking treatment from many different doctors or hospitals, which may include using a fake name Reluctance to allow doctors to talk to family or friends or to other health care professionals Frequent stays in the hospital Eagerness to have frequent testing or risky operations Many surgical scars or evidence of numerous procedures Having few visitors when hospitalized Arguing with doctors and staff Factious disorder imposed on another Factitious disorder imposed on another (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or psychological signs or symptoms of illness, or causes injury or disease in another person with the intention of deceiving others.	general
People with this disorder present another person as sick, injured or having problems functioning, claiming that medical attention is needed.	general
Usually this involves a parent harming a child.	general
This form of abuse can put a child in serious danger of injury or unnecessary medical care.	general
How those with factitious disorder fake illness Because people with factitious disorder become experts at faking symptoms and diseases or inflicting real injuries upon themselves, it may be hard for health care professionals and loved ones to know if illnesses are real or not.	general
People with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways, such as: Even when an actual medical or psychological condition exists, they may exaggerate symptoms to appear sicker or more impaired than is true.	general
Exaggerating existing symptoms.	general
They may give loved ones, health care professionals or support groups a false medical history, such as claiming to have had cancer or AIDS.	general
Or they may falsify medical records to indicate an illness.	general
Making up histories.	general
They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out.	general
Faking symptoms.	general
They may make themselves sick, for example, by injecting themselves with bacteria, milk, gasoline or feces.	general
They may injure, cut or burn themselves.	general
They may take medications, such as blood thinners or drugs for diabetes, to mimic diseases.	general
They may also interfere with wound healing, such as reopening or infecting cuts.	general
Causing self-harm.	general
They may manipulate medical instruments to skew results, such as heating up thermometers.	general
Or they may tamper with lab tests, such as contaminating their urine samples with blood or other substances.	general
When to see a doctor People with factitious disorder may be well aware of the risk of injury or even death as a result of self-harm or the treatment they seek, but they can't control their behaviors and they're unlikely to seek help.	general
Even when confronted with objective proof ‚Äî such as a videotape ‚Äî that they're causing their illness, they often deny it and refuse psychiatric help.	general
If you think a loved one may be exaggerating or faking health problems, it may help to attempt a gentle conversation about your concerns.	general
Try to avoid anger, judgment or confrontation.	general
Also try to reinforce and encourage more healthy, productive activities rather than focusing on dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors.	general
Offer support and caring and, if possible, help in finding treatment.	general
If your loved one causes self-inflicted injury or attempts suicide, call 911 or emergency medical help or, if you can safely do so, take him or her to an emergency room immediately.	general
The cause of factitious disorder is unknown.	general
However, the disorder may be caused by a combination of psychological factors and stressful life experiences.	general
Risk factors Several factors may increase the risk of developing factitious disorder, including: Childhood trauma, such as emotional, physical or sexual abuse A serious illness during childhood Loss of a loved one through death, illness or abandonment Past experiences during a time of sickness and the attention it brought A poor sense of identity or self-esteem Personality disorders Work in the health care field Factitious disorder is considered rare, but it's not known how many people have the disorder.	general
Some people use fake names to avoid detection, some visit many different hospitals and doctors, and some are never identified ‚Äî all of which make it difficult to get a reliable estimate.	general
Complications People with factitious disorder are willing to risk their lives to be seen as sick.	general
They frequently have other mental health disorders as well.	general
As a result, they face many possible complications, including: Injury or death from self-inflicted medical conditions Severe health problems from infections or unnecessary surgery or other procedures Loss of organs or limbs from unnecessary surgery Alcohol or other substance abuse Significant problems in daily life, relationships and work Abuse when the behavior is inflicted on another Because the cause of factitious disorder is unknown, there's currently no known way to prevent it.	general
Early recognition and treatment of factitious disorder may help avoid unnecessary and potentially dangerous tests and treatment.	general
Factor V Leiden (FAK-tur five LIDE-n) is a mutation of one of the clotting factors in the blood.	general
This mutation can increase your chance of developing abnormal blood clots, most commonly in your legs or lungs.	general
Most people with factor V Leiden never develop abnormal clots.	general
But in people who do, these abnormal clots can lead to long-term health problems or become life-threatening.	general
Both men and women can have factor V Leiden.	general
Women who carry the factor V Leiden mutation may have an increased tendency to develop blood clots during pregnancy or when taking the hormone estrogen.	general
If you have factor V Leiden and have developed blood clots, anticoagulant medications can lessen your risk of developing additional blood clots and help you avoid potentially serious complications.	general
The factor V Leiden mutation does not itself cause any symptoms.	general
Since factor V Leiden is a risk for developing blood clots in the leg or lungs, the first indication that you have the disorder may be the development of an abnormal blood clot.	general
Some clots do no damage and disappear on their own.	general
Others can be life-threatening.	general
Symptoms of a blood clot depend on what part of your body is affected.	general
A clot in a deep vein This is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which most commonly occurs in the legs.	general
A DVT may not cause any symptoms.	general
If signs and symptoms do occur, they can include: A clot that travels to your lungs Known as a pulmonary embolism, this occurs when a portion of a DVT breaks free and travels through the right side of your heart to your lung, where it blocks blood flow.	general
This can be a life-threatening situation.	general
Signs and symptoms may include: Sudden shortness of breath A cough that produces bloody or blood-streaked sputum Rapid heartbeat When to see a doctor Seek medical attention immediately if you have signs or symptoms of either a DVT or a pulmonary embolism.	general
If you have factor V Leiden, you inherited either one copy or, rarely, two copies of the defective gene.	general
Inheriting one copy slightly increases your risk of developing blood clots.	general
Inheriting two copies ‚Äî one from each parent ‚Äî significantly increases your risk of developing blood clots.	general
Risk factors A family history of factor V Leiden increases your risk of inheriting the disorder.	general
The disorder is most common in people who are white and of European descent.	general
People who have inherited factor V Leiden from only one parent have a 5 percent chance of developing an abnormal blood clot by age 65.	general
Factors that increase this risk include: Inheriting the genetic mutation from both parents instead of just one can significantly increase your risk of abnormal blood clots.	general
Two faulty genes.	general
Extended periods of immobility, such as sitting during a long airplane flight, can increase the risk of leg clots.	general
Immobility.	general
Oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy and pregnancy can make you more likely to develop blood clots.	general
Surgeries or injuries such as broken bones can increase your risk of abnormal blood clots.	general
Surgeries or injuries.	general
Abnormal blood clots are more common in people who have blood types of A, B or AB compared with those with blood type O. Non-O blood type.	general
Complications Factor V Leiden can cause blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis) and lungs (pulmonary embolism).	general
These blood clots can be life-threatening.	general
A normal arch leaves a footprint similar to the one depicted on the left, while flatfeet typically produces a footprint such as the one pictured on the right.	general
You have flatfeet when the arches on the inside of your feet are flattened, allowing the entire soles of your feet to touch the floor when you stand up.	general
A common and usually painless condition, flatfeet can occur when the arches don't develop during childhood.	general
In other cases, flatfeet develop after an injury or from the simple wear-and-tear stresses of age.	general
Flatfeet can sometimes contribute to problems in your ankles and knees because the condition can alter the alignment of your legs.	general
If you aren't having pain, no treatment is usually necessary for flatfeet.	general
Most people have no signs or symptoms associated with flatfeet.	general
But some people with flatfeet experience foot pain, particularly in the heel or arch area.	general
Pain may worsen with activity.	general
Swelling along the inside of the ankle can also occur.	general
When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor if you or your child has foot pain.	general
A flat foot is normal in infants and toddlers, because the foot's arch hasn't yet developed.	general
Most people's arches develop throughout childhood, but some people never develop arches.	general
This is a normal variation in foot type, and people without arches may or may not have problems.	general
Some children have flexible flatfoot, in which the arch is visible when the child is sitting or standing on tiptoes, but disappears when the child stands.	general
Most children outgrow flexible flatfoot without problems.	general
Arches can also fall over time.	general
Years of wear and tear can weaken the tendon that runs along the inside of your ankle and helps support your arch.	general
Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four congenital abnormalities.	general
The four defects include a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary valve stenosis, a misplaced aorta and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy).	general
They usually result in an insufficient amount of oxygenated blood reaching the body.	general
Tetralogy of Fallot (teh-TRAL-uh-jee of fuh-LOW) is a rare condition caused by a combination of four heart defects that are present at birth (congenital).	general
These defects, which affect the structure of the heart, cause oxygen-poor blood to flow out of the heart and to the rest of the body.	general
Infants and children with tetralogy of Fallot usually have blue-tinged skin because their blood doesn't carry enough oxygen.	general
Tetralogy of Fallot is often diagnosed during infancy or soon after.	general
However, tetralogy of Fallot might not be detected until later in life in some adults, depending on the severity of the defects and symptoms.	general
With early diagnosis followed by appropriate surgical treatment, most children and adults who have tetralogy of Fallot live relatively normal lives, though they'll need regular medical care throughout life and might have restrictions on exercise.	general
Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms vary, depending on the extent of obstruction of blood flow out of the right ventricle and into the lungs.	general
Signs and symptoms may include: A bluish coloration of the skin caused by blood low in oxygen (cyanosis) Shortness of breath and rapid breathing, especially during feeding or exercise Loss of consciousness (fainting) Clubbing of fingers and toes ‚Äî an abnormal, rounded shape of the nail bed Poor weight gain Irritability Sometimes, babies who have tetralogy of Fallot will suddenly develop deep blue skin, nails and lips after crying or feeding, or when agitated.	general
These episodes are called tet spells and are caused by a rapid drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood.	general
Tet spells are most common in young infants, around 2 to 4 months old.	general
Toddlers or older children might instinctively squat when they're short of breath.	general
Squatting increases blood flow to the lungs.	general
When to see a doctor Seek medical help if you notice that your baby has the following symptoms: Difficulty breathing Passing out or seizures Unusual irritability If your baby becomes blue (cyanotic), place your baby on his or her side and pull your baby's knees up to his or her chest.	general
This helps increase blood flow to the lungs.	general
Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.	general
Tetralogy of Fallot occurs during fetal growth, when the baby's heart is developing.	general
While factors such as poor maternal nutrition, viral illness or genetic disorders might increase the risk of this condition, in most cases the cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown.	general
The four abnormalities that make up the tetralogy of Fallot include: Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve ‚Äî the valve that separates the lower right chamber of the heart (right ventricle) from the main blood vessel leading to the lungs (pulmonary artery).	general
Pulmonary valve stenosis.	general
Narrowing (constriction) of the pulmonary valve reduces blood flow to the lungs.	general
The narrowing might also affect the muscle beneath the pulmonary valve.	general
In some severe cases, the pulmonary valve doesn't form properly (pulmonary atresia) and causes reduced blood flow to the lungs.	general
A ventricular septal defect is a hole (defect) in the wall (septum) that separates the two lower chambers of the heart ‚Äî the left and right ventricles.	general
The hole allows deoxygenated blood in the right ventricle ‚Äî blood that has circulated through the body and is returning to the lungs to replenish its oxygen supply ‚Äî to flow into the left ventricle and mix with oxygenated blood fresh from the lungs.	general
Ventricular septal defect.	general
Blood from the left ventricle also flows back to the right ventricle in an inefficient manner.	general
This ability for blood to flow through the ventricular septal defect reduces the supply of oxygenated blood to the body and eventually can weaken the heart.	general
Normally the aorta ‚Äî the main artery leading out to the body ‚Äî branches off the left ventricle.	general
In tetralogy of Fallot, the aorta is shifted slightly to the right and lies directly above the ventricular septal defect.	general
Overriding aorta.	general
In this position the aorta receives blood from both the right and left ventricles, mixing the oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle with the oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle.	general
When the heart's pumping action is overworked, it causes the muscular wall of the right ventricle to thicken.	general
Over time this might cause the heart to stiffen, become weak and eventually fail.	general
Right ventricular hypertrophy.	general
Some children or adults who have tetralogy of Fallot may have other heart defects, such as a hole between the heart's upper chambers (atrial septal defect), a right aortic arch or abnormalities of the coronary arteries.	general
Risk factors While the exact cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown, various factors might increase the risk of a baby being born with this condition.	general
These risk factors include: A viral illness during pregnancy, such as rubella (German measles) Alcoholism during pregnancy A parent who has tetralogy of Fallot The presence of Down syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome Complications All babies who have tetralogy of Fallot need corrective surgery.	general
Without treatment, your baby might not grow and develop properly.	general
Your baby may also be at an increased risk of serious complications, such as infective endocarditis ‚Äî an infection of the inner lining of the heart or heart valve caused by a bacterial infection.	general
Untreated cases of tetralogy of Fallot usually develop severe complications over time, which might result in death or disability by early adulthood.	general
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare, inherited condition caused by a defect in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene.	general
Most people inherit the gene from a parent.	general
But for 25 to 30 percent of people, the genetic mutation occurs spontaneously.	general
FAP causes extra tissue (polyps) to form in your large intestine (colon) and rectum.	general
Polyps can also occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract, especially the upper part of your small intestine (duodenum).	general
If untreated, the polyps in the colon and rectum are likely to become cancerous when you are in your 40s.	general
Most people with familial adenomatous polyposis eventually need surgery to remove the large intestine to prevent cancer.	general
The polyps in the duodenum also can develop cancer, but they can usually be managed by careful monitoring and by removing polyps regularly.	general
Some people have a milder form of the condition, called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP).	general
People with AFAP usually have fewer colon polyps (an average of 30) and develop cancer later in life.	general
The main sign of FAP is hundreds or even thousands of polyps growing in your colon and rectum, usually starting by your mid-teens.	general
The polyps are nearly 100 percent certain to develop into colon cancer or rectal cancer by the time you're in your 40s.	general
Familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by a defect in a gene that's usually inherited from a parent.	general
But some people develop the abnormal gene that causes the condition.	general
Risk factors Your risk of familial adenomatous polyposis is higher if you have a parent, child, brother, or sister with the condition.	general
Complications In addition to colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis can cause other complications: These polyps grow in the upper part of your small intestine and may become cancerous.	general
But with careful monitoring, duodenal polyps can often be detected and removed before cancer develops.	general
Duodenal polyps.	general
These polyps occur where the bile and pancreas ducts enter the duodenum (ampulla).	general
Periampullary polyps might become cancerous but can often be detected and removed before cancer develops.	general
Periampullary polyps.	general
These polyps grow in the lining of your stomach.	general
Gastric fundic polyps.	general
These noncancerous masses can arise anywhere in the body but often develop in the stomach area (abdomen).	general
Desmoids can cause serious problems if they grow into nerves or blood vessels or exert pressure on other organs in your body.	general
Rarely, FAP can cause cancer to develop in your thyroid gland, central nervous system, adrenal glands, liver or other organs.	general
Other cancers.	general
Noncancerous (benign) skin tumors.	general
Benign bone growths (osteomas).	general
These are benign pigment changes in the retina of your eye.	general
Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE).	general
These include extra teeth or teeth that don't come in.	general
Dental abnormalities.	general
Low numbers of red blood cells (anemia).	general
Preventing FAP is not possible, since it is an inherited genetic condition.	general
However, if you or your child is at risk of FAP because of a family member with the condition, you will need genetic testing and counseling.	general
If you have FAP, you will need regular screening, followed by surgery if needed.	general
Surgery can help prevent the development of colorectal cancer or other complications.	general
Familial hypercholesterolemia affects the way the body processes cholesterol.	general
As a result, people with familial hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of heart disease and a greater risk of early heart attack.	general
The gene that causes familial hypercholesterolemia is inherited.	general
The condition is present from birth.	general
Treatments including medications and healthy lifestyle behaviors can help reduce the risks.	general
High cholesterol is a common medical condition, but it's often the result of unhealthy lifestyle choices, and thus preventable and treatable.	general
With familial hypercholesterolemia, a person's risk of high cholesterol is higher because a defect (mutation) in a gene changes how the body processes cholesterol.	general
"This mutation prevents the body from removing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the ""bad"" cholesterol, from the blood."	general
As a result, plaques can cause your arteries to narrow and harden, increasing the risk of heart disease.	general
Genetic testing can reveal whether you have this mutation.	general
These gene mutations are passed from parent to child.	general
To have the condition, children need to inherit an altered copy of the gene from one parent.	general
Most people with familial hypercholesterolemia have one affected gene and one normal gene.	general
In rare cases, a person inherits an affected copy from both parents, which can lead to a more severe form of the condition.	general
Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by a gene that's passed down from one or both parents.	general
People who have this condition are born with it.	general
This defect prevents the body from ridding itself of the type of cholesterol that can build up in your arteries and cause heart disease.	general
This type of cholesterol is called low-density lipoprotein but it's also commonly known as LDL or bad cholesterol.	general
LDL cholesterol can cause your arteries to get hard and narrow.	general
This increases your risk of a heart attack and heart disease.	general
Risk factors The risk of familial hypercholesterolemia is higher if one or both of your parents have the gene defect that causes it.	general
Most people who have the condition got one affected gene.	general
But in rare cases, a child can get the affected gene from both parents.	general
This can cause a more severe form of the condition.	general
Familial Mediterranean fever is a genetic autoinflammatory disorder that causes recurrent fevers and painful inflammation of your abdomen, lungs and joints.	general
Familial Mediterranean fever is an inherited disorder that usually occurs in people of Mediterranean origin ‚Äî including those of North African, Jewish, Arab, Armenian, Turkish, Greek or Italian ancestry.	general
But it can affect people in any ethnic group.	general
Familial Mediterranean fever is typically diagnosed during childhood.	general
While there's no cure for this disorder, you may be able to relieve signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever ‚Äî or even prevent them altogether ‚Äî by sticking to your treatment plan.	general
Signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever usually begin during childhood.	general
They occur in bouts called attacks that last one to three days.	general
Arthritic attacks may last for weeks or months.	general
Signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever include: A red rash on your legs, especially below your knees Muscle aches A swollen, tender scrotum Between attacks, you'll likely feel normal.	general
Symptom-free periods may be as short as a few days or as long as several years.	general
When to see a doctor If you or your child experiences sudden worrisome signs or symptoms, such as shortness of breath or passing out, call 911 or emergency medical help.	general
See your doctor if you or your child has a sudden fever accompanied by pain in the abdomen, chest and joints.	general
Familial Mediterranean fever is caused by a gene mutation that's passed from parents to children.	general
The gene mutation causes problems in regulating inflammation in the body.	general
In people with familial Mediterranean fever, the mutation occurs in a gene called MEFV.	general
Many different mutations in MEFV are linked to familial Mediterranean fever.	general
Some mutations may cause very severe cases, while others may result in milder signs and symptoms.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of familial Mediterranean fever include: If you have a family history of familial Mediterranean fever, your risk of the disease is increased.	general
Having a family history of the disease.	general
If your family can trace its history to the Mediterranean region, your risk of the disease may be increased.	general
Familial Mediterranean fever can affect people in any ethnic group, but it may be more likely in people of North African, Jewish, Arab, Armenian, Turkish, Greek or Italian descent.	general
Being of Mediterranean ancestry.	general
Complications Complications can occur if familial Mediterranean fever isn't treated.	general
Complications can include: During attacks of familial Mediterranean fever, your body may produce an abnormal protein (amyloid A).	general
The protein can accumulate in your body and cause organ damage (amyloidosis).	general
Abnormal protein in the blood.	general
Amyloidosis can damage the kidneys, causing nephrotic syndrome.	general
Nephrotic syndrome occurs when your kidneys' filtering systems (glomeruli) are damaged.	general
People with this condition may lose large amounts of protein in their urine.	general
Nephrotic syndrome can lead to blood clots in your kidneys (renal vein thrombosis) or kidney failure.	general
Kidney damage.	general
Inflammation caused by familial Mediterranean fever may also affect the female reproductive organs, causing infertility.	general
Infertility in women.	general
Arthritis is common in people with familial Mediterranean fever.	general
The most commonly affected joints are the knees, ankles, hips and elbows.	general
Joint pain.	general

Farsightedness (hyperopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see distant objects clearly, but objects nearby may be blurry.	general
The degree of your farsightedness influences your focusing ability.	general
People with severe farsightedness may see clearly only objects a great distance away, while those with mild farsightedness may be able to clearly see objects that are closer.	general
Farsightedness usually is present at birth and tends to run in families.	general
You can easily correct this condition with eyeglasses or contact lenses.	general
Another treatment option is surgery.	general
Products & Services You need to squint to see clearly You have eyestrain, including burning eyes, and aching in or around the eyes You experience general eye discomfort or a headache after a prolonged interval of conducting close tasks, such as reading, writing, computer work or drawing When to see a doctor If your degree of farsightedness is pronounced enough that you can't perform a task as well as you wish, or if your quality of vision detracts from your enjoyment of activities, see an eye doctor.	general
He or she can determine the degree of your farsightedness and advise you of options to correct your vision.	general
Since it may not always be readily apparent that you're having trouble with your vision, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends the following intervals for regular eye exams: If you're at high risk of certain eye diseases, such as glaucoma, get a dilated eye exam every one to two years, starting at age 40.	general
If you don't wear glasses or contacts, have no symptoms of eye trouble, and are at a low risk of developing eye diseases, such as glaucoma, get an eye exam at the following intervals: An initial exam at 40 Every two to four years between ages 40 and 54 Every one to three years between ages 55 and 64 Every one to two years beginning at age 65 If you wear glasses or contacts or you have a health condition that affects the eyes, such as diabetes, you'll likely need to have your eyes checked regularly.	general
Ask your eye doctor how frequently you need to schedule your appointments.	general
But, if you notice any problems with your vision, schedule an appointment with your eye doctor as soon as possible, even if you've recently had an eye exam.	general
Blurred vision, for example, may suggest you need a prescription change, or it could be a sign of another problem.	general
Children and adolescents Children need to be screened for eye disease and have their vision tested by a pediatrician, an ophthalmologist, an optometrist or another trained screener at the following ages and intervals.	general
Age 6 months Age 3 years Before first grade and every two years during school years, at well-child visits, or through school or public screenings Anatomy of the eye Anatomy of the eye Your eye is a complex and compact structure measuring about 1 inch (2.	general
5 centimeters) in diameter.	general
It receives millions of pieces of information about the outside world, which are quickly processed by your brain.	general
Farsightedness (hyperopia) Farsightedness (hyperopia) With normal vision, an image is sharply focused onto the surface of the retina.	general
In farsightedness (hyperopia), your cornea doesn't refract light properly, so the point of focus falls behind the retina.	general
This makes close-up objects appear blurry.	general
Your eye has two parts that focus images: is the clear, dome-shaped front surface of your eye.	general
is a clear structure about the size and shape of an M&M's candy.	general
In a normally shaped eye, each of these focusing elements has a perfectly smooth curvature, like the surface of a marble.	general
A cornea and lens with such curvature bend (refract) all incoming light to make a sharply focused image directly on the retina, at the back of your eye.	general
A refractive error If your cornea or lens isn't evenly and smoothly curved, light rays aren't refracted properly, and you have a refractive error.	general
Farsightedness occurs when your eyeball is shorter than normal or your cornea is curved too little.	general
The effect is the opposite of nearsightedness.	general
In adults with farsightedness, both near and distant objects can be blurred.	general
Other refractive errors In addition to farsightedness, other refractive errors include: Nearsightedness usually occurs when your eyeball is longer than normal or your cornea is curved too steeply.	general
Instead of being focused precisely on your retina, light is focused in front of your retina, resulting in a blurry appearance for distant objects.	general
Nearsightedness (myopia).	general
This occurs when your cornea or lens is curved more steeply in one direction than in another.	general
Uncorrected astigmatism blurs your vision.	general
Astigmatism.	general
Complications Farsightedness can be associated with several problems, such as: Some children with farsightedness may develop crossed eyes.	general
Specially designed eyeglasses that correct for part or all of the farsightedness may effectively treat this problem.	general
Crossed eyes.	general
Uncorrected farsightedness can affect your quality of life.	general
You might not be able to perform a task as well as you wish.	general
And your limited vision may detract from your enjoyment of day-to-day activities.	general
Reduced quality of life.	general
Uncorrected farsightedness may cause you to squint or strain your eyes to maintain focus.	general
This can lead to eyestrain and headaches.	general
Your own safety and that of others may be jeopardized if you have an uncorrected vision problem.	general
This could be especially serious if you are driving a car or operating heavy equipment.	general
Impaired safety.	general
The cost of corrective lenses, eye exams and medical treatments can add up, especially with a chronic condition such as farsightedness.	general
Financial burden.	general
A febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child caused by a spike in body temperature, often from an infection.	general
They occur in young children with normal development without a history of neurologic symptoms.	general
It can be frightening when your child has a febrile seizure, and the few minutes it lasts can seem like an eternity.	general
Fortunately, they're usually harmless and typically don't indicate a serious health problem.	general
You can help by keeping your child safe during a febrile seizure and by offering comfort afterward.	general
Call your doctor to have your child evaluated as soon as possible after a febrile seizure.	general
Usually, a child having a febrile seizure shakes all over and loses consciousness.	general
Sometimes, the child may get very stiff or twitch in just one area of the body.	general
A child having a febrile seizure may: Have a fever higher than 100.	general
4 F (38.	general
0 C) Lose consciousness Febrile seizures are classified as simple or complex: This most common type lasts from a few seconds to 15 minutes.	general
Simple febrile seizures do not recur within a 24-hour period and are not specific to one part of the body.	general
Simple febrile seizures.	general
This type lasts longer than 15 minutes, occurs more than once within 24 hours or is confined to one side of your child's body.	general
Complex febrile seizures.	general
Febrile seizures most often occur within 24 hours of the onset of a fever and can be the first sign that a child is ill.	general
When to see a doctor See your child's doctor as soon as possible after your child's first febrile seizure, even if it lasts only a few seconds.	general
Call an ambulance to take your child to the emergency room if the seizure lasts longer than five minutes or is accompanied by: Usually, a higher than normal body temperature causes febrile seizures.	general
Even a low-grade fever can trigger a febrile seizure.	general
The fevers that trigger febrile seizures are usually caused by a viral infection, and less commonly by a bacterial infection.	general
Influenza and the virus that causes roseola, which often are accompanied by high fevers, appear to be most frequently associated with febrile seizures.	general
Post-immunization seizures The risk of febrile seizures may increase after some childhood immunizations.	general
These include the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis or measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations.	general
A child can develop a low-grade fever after a vaccination.	general
The fever, not the vaccination, causes the seizure.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of having a febrile seizure include: Most febrile seizures occur in children between 6 months and 5 years of age, with the greatest risk between 12 and 18 months of age.	general
Some children inherit a family's tendency to have seizures with a fever.	general
Additionally, researchers have linked several genes to a susceptibility to febrile seizures.	general
Family history.	general
Complications Most febrile seizures produce no lasting effects.	general
Simple febrile seizures don't cause brain damage, intellectual disability or learning disabilities, and they don't mean your child has a more serious underlying disorder.	general
Febrile seizures are provoked seizures and don't indicate epilepsy.	general
Epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures caused by abnormal electrical signals in the brain.	general
Recurrent febrile seizures The most common complication is the possibility of more febrile seizures.	general
The risk of recurrence is higher if: Your child's first seizure resulted from a low fever.	general
The period between the start of the fever and the seizure was short.	general
An immediate family member has a history of febrile seizures.	general
Your child was younger than 18 months at the time of the first febrile seizure.	general
Most febrile seizures occur in the first few hours of a fever, during the initial rise in body temperature.	general
Giving your child medications Giving your child infants' or children's acetaminophen (Children's Non-Aspirin Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Infants' Motrin, Children's Motrin, others) at the beginning of a fever may make your child more comfortable, but it won't prevent a seizure.	general
Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers.	general
Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 3, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin.	general
This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children.	general
Prescription prevention medications Rarely, prescription anticonvulsant medications are used to try to prevent febrile seizures.	general
However, these medications can have serious side effects that may outweigh any possible benefit.	general
Rectal diazepam (Diastat) or nasal midazolam might be prescribed to be used as needed for children who are prone to long febrile seizures.	general
These medications are typically used to treat seizures that last longer than five minutes or if the child has more than one seizure within 24 hours.	general
They are not typically used to prevent febrile seizures.	general
Infertility is defined as trying to get pregnant (with frequent intercourse) for at least a year with no success.	general
Female infertility, male infertility or a combination of the two affects millions of couples in the United States.	general
An estimated 10 to 18 percent of couples have trouble getting pregnant or having a successful delivery.	general
Infertility results from female factors about one-third of the time and male factors about one-third of the time.	general
The cause is either unknown or a combination of male and female factors in the remaining cases.	general
Female infertility causes can be difficult to diagnose.	general
There are many available treatments, which will depend on the cause of infertility.	general
Many infertile couples will go on to conceive a child without treatment.	general
After trying to get pregnant for two years, about 95 percent of couples successfully conceive.	general
Products & Services The main symptom of infertility is the inability to get pregnant.	general
A menstrual cycle that's too long (35 days or more), too short (less than 21 days), irregular or absent can mean that you're not ovulating.	general
There may be no other outward signs or symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor When to seek help sometimes depends on your age: most doctors recommend trying to get pregnant for at least a year before testing or treatment.	general
Up to age 35, discuss your concerns with your doctor after six months of trying.	general
If you're between 35 and 40, your doctor may want to begin testing or treatment right away.	general
If you're older than 40, Your doctor may also want to begin testing or treatment right away if you or your partner has known fertility problems, or if you have a history of irregular or painful periods, pelvic inflammatory disease, repeated miscarriages, prior cancer treatment, or endometriosis.	general
Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.	general
Fertilization and implantation Fertilization and implantation During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote.	general
Then the zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula.	general
Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst.	general
The blastocyst then burrows into the uterine wall ‚Äî a process called implantation.	general
Each of these factors is essential to become pregnant: To get pregnant, your ovaries must produce and release an egg, a process known as ovulation.	general
Your doctor can help evaluate your menstrual cycles and confirm ovulation.	general
You need to ovulate.	general
For most couples, this isn't a problem unless your partner has a history of illness or surgery.	general
Your doctor can run some simple tests to evaluate the health of your partner's sperm.	general
Your partner needs sperm.	general
You need to have regular sexual intercourse during your fertile time.	general
Your doctor can help you better understand when you're most fertile.	general
You need to have regular intercourse.	general
The egg and sperm meet in the fallopian tubes, and the embryo needs a healthy uterus in which to grow.	general
You need to have open fallopian tubes and a normal uterus.	general
For pregnancy to occur, every step of the human reproduction process has to happen correctly.	general
The steps in this process are: One of the two ovaries releases a mature egg.	general
The egg is picked up by the fallopian tube.	general
Sperm swim up the cervix, through the uterus and into the fallopian tube to reach the egg for fertilization.	general
The fertilized egg travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus.	general
The fertilized egg implants and grows in the uterus.	general
In women, a number of factors can disrupt this process at any step.	general
Female infertility is caused by one or more of the factors below.	general
Ovulation disorders Ovulation disorders, meaning you ovulate infrequently or not at all, account for infertility in about 1 in 4 infertile couples.	general
Problems with the regulation of reproductive hormones by the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, or problems in the ovary, can cause ovulation disorders.	general
causes a hormone imbalance, which affects ovulation.	general
is associated with insulin resistance and obesity, abnormal hair growth on the face or body, and acne.	general
It's the most common cause of female infertility.	general
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).	general
Two hormones produced by the pituitary gland are responsible for stimulating ovulation each month ‚Äî follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).	general
Excess physical or emotional stress, a very high or very low body weight, or a recent substantial weight gain or loss can disrupt production of these hormones and affect ovulation.	general
Irregular or absent periods are the most common signs.	general
Hypothalamic dysfunction.	general
Also called primary ovarian insufficiency, this disorder is usually caused by an autoimmune response or by premature loss of eggs from your ovary (possibly from genetics or chemotherapy).	general
The ovary no longer produces eggs, and it lowers estrogen production in women under the age of 40.	general
Premature ovarian failure.	general
The pituitary gland may cause excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia), which reduces estrogen production and may cause infertility.	general
Usually related to a pituitary gland problem, this can also be caused by medications you're taking for another disease.	general
Too much prolactin.	general
Damage to fallopian tubes (tubal infertility) Damaged or blocked fallopian tubes keep sperm from getting to the egg or block the passage of the fertilized egg into the uterus.	general
Causes of fallopian tube damage or blockage can include: Pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes due to chlamydia, gonorrhea or other sexually transmitted infections Previous surgery in the abdomen or pelvis, including surgery for ectopic pregnancy, in which a fertilized egg implants and develops in a fallopian tube instead of the uterus Pelvic tuberculosis, a major cause of tubal infertility worldwide, although uncommon in the United States Endometriosis Endometriosis occurs when tissue that normally grows in the uterus implants and grows in other locations.	general
This extra tissue growth ‚Äî and the surgical removal of it ‚Äî can cause scarring, which may block fallopian tubes and keep an egg and sperm from uniting.	general
Endometriosis can also affect the lining of the uterus, disrupting implantation of the fertilized egg.	general
The condition also seems to affect fertility in less-direct ways, such as damage to the sperm or egg.	general
Uterine or cervical causes Several uterine or cervical causes can impact fertility by interfering with implantation or increasing the likelihood of a miscarriage: Benign polyps or tumors (fibroids or myomas) are common in the uterus.	general
Some can block fallopian tubes or interfere with implantation, affecting fertility.	general
However, many women who have fibroids or polyps do become pregnant.	general
Endometriosis scarring or inflammation within the uterus can disrupt implantation.	general
Uterine abnormalities present from birth, such as an abnormally shaped uterus, can cause problems becoming or remaining pregnant.	general
Cervical stenosis, a narrowing of the cervix, can be caused by an inherited malformation or damage to the cervix.	general
Sometimes the cervix can't produce the best type of mucus to allow the sperm to travel through the cervix into the uterus.	general
Unexplained infertility Sometimes, the cause of infertility is never found.	general
A combination of several minor factors in both partners could cause unexplained fertility problems.	general
Although it's frustrating to get no specific answer, this problem may correct itself with time.	general
But, you shouldn't delay treatment for infertility.	general
More Information Certain factors may put you at higher risk of infertility, including: The quality and quantity of a woman's eggs begin to decline with increasing age.	general
In the mid-30s, the rate of follicle loss speeds, resulting in fewer and poorer quality eggs.	general
This makes conception more difficult, and increases the risk of miscarriage.	general
Besides damaging your cervix and fallopian tubes, smoking increases your risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.	general
It's also thought to age your ovaries and deplete your eggs prematurely.	general
Stop smoking before beginning fertility treatment.	general
Being overweight or significantly underweight may affect normal ovulation.	general
Getting to a healthy body mass index (BMI) may increase the frequency of ovulation and likelihood of pregnancy.	general
Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can damage the fallopian tubes.	general
Having unprotected intercourse with multiple partners increases your risk of a sexually transmitted infection that may cause fertility problems later.	general
Sexual history.	general
Stick to moderate alcohol consumption of no more than one alcoholic drink per day.	general
For women thinking about getting pregnant soon or in the future, these tips may help optimize fertility: Overweight and underweight women are at increased risk of ovulation disorders.	general
If you need to lose weight, exercise moderately.	general
Strenuous, intense exercise of more than five hours a week has been associated with decreased ovulation.	general
Maintain a normal weight.	general
Tobacco has multiple negative effects on fertility, not to mention your general health and the health of a fetus.	general
If you smoke and are considering pregnancy, quit now.	general
Quit smoking.	general
Heavy alcohol use may lead to decreased fertility.	general
And any alcohol use can affect the health of a developing fetus.	general
If you're planning to become pregnant, avoid alcohol, and don't drink alcohol while you're pregnant.	general
Avoid alcohol.	general
Some studies have shown that couples experiencing psychological stress had poorer results with infertility treatment.	general
If you can, find a way to reduce stress in your life before trying to become pregnant.	general
Reduce stress.	general
Research suggests that limiting caffeine intake to less than 200 milligrams a day shouldn't affect your ability to get pregnant.	general
That's about one to two cups of 6 to 8 ounces of coffee per day.	general
Limit caffeine.	general

Persistent, recurrent problems with sexual response, desire, orgasm or pain ‚Äî that distress you or strain your relationship with your partner ‚Äî are known medically as sexual dysfunction.	general
Many women experience problems with sexual function at some point, and some have difficulties throughout their lives.	general
Female sexual dysfunction can occur at any stage of life.	general
It can occur only in certain sexual situations or in all sexual situations.	general
Sexual response involves a complex interplay of physiology, emotions, experiences, beliefs, lifestyle and relationships.	general
Disruption of any component can affect sexual desire, arousal or satisfaction, and treatment often involves more than one approach.	general
Products & Services Symptoms vary depending on what type of sexual dysfunction you're experiencing: This most common of female sexual dysfunctions involves a lack of sexual interest and willingness to be sexual.	general
Low sexual desire.	general
Your desire for sex might be intact, but you have difficulty with arousal or are unable to become aroused or maintain arousal during sexual activity.	general
Sexual arousal disorder.	general
You have persistent or recurrent difficulty in achieving orgasm after sufficient sexual arousal and ongoing stimulation.	general
Orgasmic disorder.	general
You have pain associated with sexual stimulation or vaginal contact.	general
Sexual pain disorder.	general
When to see a doctor If sexual problems affect your relationship or worry you, make an appointment with your doctor for evaluation.	general
Sexual problems often develop when your hormones are in flux, such as after having a baby or during menopause.	general
Major illness, such as cancer, diabetes, or heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, can also contribute to sexual dysfunction.	general
Factors ‚Äî often interrelated ‚Äî that contribute to sexual dissatisfaction or dysfunction include: Any number of medical conditions, including cancer, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and bladder problems, can lead to sexual dysfunction.	general
Certain medications, including some antidepressants, blood pressure medications, antihistamines and chemotherapy drugs, can decrease your sexual desire and your body's ability to experience orgasm.	general
Lower estrogen levels after menopause may lead to changes in your genital tissues and sexual responsiveness.	general
A decrease in estrogen leads to decreased blood flow to the pelvic region, which can result in less genital sensation, as well as needing more time to build arousal and reach orgasm.	general
The vaginal lining also becomes thinner and less elastic, particularly if you're not sexually active.	general
These factors can lead to painful intercourse (dyspareunia).	general
Sexual desire also decreases when hormonal levels decrease.	general
Your body's hormone levels also shift after giving birth and during breast-feeding, which can lead to vaginal dryness and can affect your desire to have sex.	general
Untreated anxiety or depression can cause or contribute to sexual dysfunction, as can long-term stress and a history of sexual abuse.	general
The worries of pregnancy and demands of being a new mother may have similar effects.	general
Psychological and social.	general
Long-standing conflicts with your partner ‚Äî about sex or other aspects of your relationship ‚Äî can diminish your sexual responsiveness as well.	general
Cultural and religious issues and problems with body image also can contribute.	general
Hip impingement occurs when the ball and socket of the hip joint don't fit together properly.	general
The restricted motion damages cartilage and can cause pain and arthritis in young adults.	general
In some cases, the ball is too misshapen to fit properly into the socket.	general
Sometimes, the exterior edge of the socket extends to the point that it covers too much of the ball.	general
Hip impingement also can be caused by a combination of these two problems.	general
Most people with hip impingement experience pain in the groin area during or after flexing the hip, as when running, jumping or sitting for a long time.	general
You may also have difficulty flexing your hip beyond a right angle.	general
Surgery may be required to prevent further hip injury.	general
Clinical trials testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.	general
"The term ""fetal macrosomia"" is used to describe a newborn who's significantly larger than average."	general
A baby diagnosed with fetal macrosomia has a birth weight of more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams), regardless of his or her gestational age.	general
About 9 percent of babies born worldwide weigh more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces.	general
However, the risks associated with fetal macrosomia increase greatly when birth weight is more than 9 pounds 15 ounces (4,500 grams).	general
Fetal macrosomia may complicate vaginal delivery and could put the baby at risk of injury during birth.	general
Fetal macrosomia also puts the baby at increased risk of health problems after birth.	general
Products & Services Fundal height Fundal height Fundal height is the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus measured in centimeters.	general
After 20 weeks of pregnancy, fundal height often matches the number of weeks you've been pregnant.	general
Polyhydramnios Polyhydramnios In polyhydramnios, excessive amniotic fluid accumulates in the uterus during pregnancy.	general
Mild cases of polyhydramnios may go away on their own.	general
Severe cases may require treatment.	general
Fetal macrosomia is difficult to detect and diagnose during pregnancy.	general
Possible signs and symptoms include: During prenatal visits, your health care provider might measure your fundal height ‚Äî the distance from the top of your uterus to your pubic bone.	general
A fundal height that measures larger than expected could be a sign of fetal macrosomia.	general
Large fundal height.	general
Too much amniotic fluid ‚Äî the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy ‚Äî might be a sign that your baby is larger than average.	general
Excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios).	general
The amount of amniotic fluid reflects your baby's urine output, and a larger baby produces more urine.	general
Some conditions that increase a baby's size might also increase his or her urine output.	general
Fetal macrosomia can be caused by genetic factors as well as maternal conditions, such as obesity or diabetes.	general
Rarely, a baby might have a medical condition that speeds fetal growth.	general
In some cases, what causes a larger than average birth weight remains unexplained.	general
Risk factors Many factors might increase the risk of fetal macrosomia ‚Äî some you can control, but others you can't.	general
For example: If you had diabetes before pregnancy (pre-gestational diabetes) or you develop diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes), fetal macrosomia is more likely.	general
Maternal diabetes.	general
If your diabetes is poorly controlled, your baby is likely to have larger shoulders and greater amounts of body fat than would a baby whose mother doesn't have diabetes.	general
If you've previously given birth to a baby diagnosed with fetal macrosomia, you're at increased risk of having another baby who has the condition.	general
Also, if you weighed more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces at birth, you're more likely to have a large baby.	general
A history of fetal macrosomia.	general
Fetal macrosomia is more likely if you're obese.	general
Maternal obesity.	general
Gaining too much weight during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal macrosomia.	general
Excessive weight gain during pregnancy.	general
The risk of fetal macrosomia increases with each pregnancy.	general
Up to the fifth pregnancy, the average birth weight for each successive pregnancy typically increases by up to about 4 ounces (113 grams).	general
Previous pregnancies.	general
Male infants typically weigh slightly more than female infants.	general
Most babies who weigh more than 9 pounds, 15 ounces (4,500 grams) are male.	general
You're having a boy.	general
If your pregnancy continues by more than two weeks past your due date, your baby is at increased risk of fetal macrosomia.	general
Overdue pregnancy.	general
Women older than 35 are more likely to have a baby diagnosed with fetal macrosomia.	general
Maternal age.	general
Fetal macrosomia is more likely to be a result of maternal diabetes, obesity or weight gain during pregnancy than other causes.	general
If these risk factors aren't present and fetal macrosomia is suspected, it's possible that your baby might have a rare medical condition that affects fetal growth.	general
Your health care provider might recommend prenatal diagnostic tests and perhaps a visit with a genetic counselor, depending on the test results.	general
Complications Fetal macrosomia poses health risks for you and your baby ‚Äî both during pregnancy and after childbirth.	general
Maternal risks Possible maternal complications of fetal macrosomia might include: Fetal macrosomia can cause a baby to become wedged in the birth canal, sustain birth injuries, or require the use of forceps or a vacuum device during delivery (operative vaginal delivery).	general
Sometimes a C-section is needed.	general
Labor problems.	general
During childbirth, fetal macrosomia can cause a baby to injure the birth canal ‚Äî such as by tearing vaginal tissues and the muscles between the vagina and the anus (perineal muscles).	general
Genital tract lacerations.	general
Fetal macrosomia increases the risk that your uterine muscles won't properly contract after you give birth (uterine atony).	general
This can lead to potentially serious bleeding after delivery.	general
Bleeding after delivery.	general
If you've had a prior C-section or major uterine surgery, fetal macrosomia increases the risk of uterine rupture ‚Äî a rare but serious complication in which the uterus tears open along the scar line from the C-section or other uterine surgery.	general
An emergency C-section is needed to prevent life-threatening complications.	general
Uterine rupture.	general
Newborn and childhood risks Possible complications of fetal macrosomia for your baby might include: A baby diagnosed with fetal macrosomia is more likely to be born with a blood sugar level that's lower than normal.	general
Lower than normal blood sugar level.	general
Research suggests that the risk of childhood obesity increases as birth weight increases.	general
Childhood obesity.	general
If your baby is diagnosed with fetal macrosomia, he or she is at risk of developing metabolic syndrome during childhood.	general
Metabolic syndrome.	general
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions ‚Äî increased blood pressure, a high blood sugar level, excess body fat around the waist or abnormal cholesterol levels ‚Äî that occur together, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.	general
Further research is needed to determine whether these effects might increase the risk of adult diabetes, obesity and heart disease.	general
You might not be able to prevent fetal macrosomia, but you can promote a healthy pregnancy.	general
For example: If you're considering pregnancy, talk to your health care provider.	general
If you're obese, he or she might also refer you to other health care providers ‚Äî such as a registered dietitian or an obesity specialist ‚Äî who can help you make changes in your lifestyle and reach a healthy weight before pregnancy.	general
Schedule a preconception appointment.	general
Gaining a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy ‚Äî often 25 to 35 pounds (about 11 to 16 kilograms) ‚Äî supports your baby's growth and development.	general
There's no one-size-fits-all approach to pregnancy weight gain, though.	general
Work with your health care provider to determine what's right for you.	general
Monitor your weight.	general
If you had diabetes before pregnancy or you develop gestational diabetes, work with your health care provider to manage the condition.	general
Controlling your blood sugar level is the best way to prevent complications, including fetal macrosomia.	general
Manage diabetes.	general
Follow your health care provider's recommendations for physical activity.	general
Include physical activity in your daily routine.	general
A fever is a temporary increase in your body temperature, often due to an illness.	general
Having a fever is a sign that something out of the ordinary is going on in your body.	general
For an adult, a fever may be uncomfortable, but usually isn't a cause for concern unless it reaches 103 F (39.	general
4 C) or higher.	general
For infants and toddlers, a slightly elevated temperature may indicate a serious infection.	general
Fevers generally go away within a few days.	general
A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever, but sometimes it's better left untreated.	general
Fever seems to play a key role in helping your body fight off a number of infections.	general
You have a fever when your temperature rises above its normal range.	general
What's normal for you may be a little higher or lower than the average normal temperature of 98.	general
6 F (37 C).	general
Depending on what's causing your fever, additional fever signs and symptoms may include: General weakness Children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years might experience febrile seizures.	general
About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.	general
Taking a temperature To check your or your child's temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.	general
Although it's not the most accurate way to take a temperature, you can use an oral thermometer for an armpit (axillary) reading: Place the thermometer in the armpit and cross your arms or your child's arms over the chest.	general
Wait four to five minutes.	general
The axillary temperature is slightly lower than an oral temperature.	general
If you call your doctor, report the actual number on the thermometer and where on the body you took the temperature.	general
Use a rectal thermometer for infants: Place a dab of petroleum jelly on the bulb.	general
Lay your baby on his or her tummy.	general
Carefully insert the bulb 1/2 to 1 inch (1.	general
3 to 2.	general
5 centimeters) into your baby's rectum.	general
Hold the bulb and your baby still for three minutes.	general
Don't let go of the thermometer while it's inside your baby.	general
If your baby squirms, the thermometer could go deeper and cause an injury.	general
When to see a doctor Fevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm ‚Äî or a reason to call a doctor.	general
Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.	general
An unexplained fever is greater cause for concern in infants and in children than in adults.	general
Call your baby's doctor if your child is: and has a rectal temperature of 100.	general
4 F (38 C) or higher.	general
Younger than age 3 months and has a rectal temperature up to 102 F (38.	general
9 C) and seems unusually irritable, lethargic or uncomfortable or has a temperature higher than 102 F (38.	general
9 C).	general
Between ages 3 and 6 months and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.	general
9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms.	general
If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a cold, cough or diarrhea, you might call your child's doctor sooner based on severity.	general
Between ages 6 and 24 months There's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive ‚Äî making eye contact with you and responding to your facial expressions and to your voice ‚Äî and is drinking fluids and playing.	general
Call your child's doctor if your child: has a severe headache or stomachache, or has any other symptoms causing significant discomfort.	general
Is listless or irritable, vomits repeatedly, Seek medical care immediately.	general
Has a fever after being left in a hot car.	general
than three days.	general
Has a fever that lasts longer Appears listless and has poor eye contact Ask your child's doctor for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a pre-existing illness.	general
Call your doctor if your temperature is 103 F (39.	general
4 C) or higher.	general
"Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever: Severe headache Unusual sensitivity to bright light Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward Mental confusion Persistent vomiting Abdominal pain or pain when urinating Convulsions or seizures Fever occurs when an area in your brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs) ‚Äî also known as your body's ""thermostat"" ‚Äî shifts the set point of your normal body temperature upward."	general
When this happens, you may feel chilled and add layers of clothing or wrap up in a blanket, or you may shiver to generate more body heat, eventually resulting in an elevated body temperature.	general
Normal body temperature varies throughout the day ‚Äî it's lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.	general
Although most people consider 98.	general
6 F (37 C) normal, your body temperature can vary by a degree or more ‚Äî from about 97 F (36.	general
1 C) to 99 F (37.	general
2 C) ‚Äî and still be considered normal.	general
Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by: Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis ‚Äî inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium) A malignant tumor Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) or pneumococcal vaccine Sometimes the cause of a fever can't be identified.	general
If you have a fever for more than three weeks and your doctor isn't able to find the cause after extensive evaluation, the diagnosis may be fever of unknown origin.	general
Complications Children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years may experience fever-induced convulsions (febrile seizures), which usually involve loss of consciousness and shaking of limbs on both sides of the body.	general
Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.	general
If a seizure occurs: Lay your child on his or her side or stomach on the floor or ground Remove any sharp objects that are near your child Loosen tight clothing Hold your child to prevent injury Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure Most seizures stop on their own.	general
Take your child to the doctor as soon as possible after the seizure to determine the cause of the fever.	general
Call for emergency medical assistance if a seizure lasts longer than five minutes.	general
You may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases.	general
Here are some tips that can help: especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.	general
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.	general
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, for times when you don't have access to soap and water.	general
Carry hand sanitizer with you as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.	general
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, and teach your children to do likewise.	general
Whenever possible, turn away from others when coughing or sneezing to avoid passing germs along to them.	general
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, with your child or children.	general
Fibroadenomas (fy-broe-ad-uh-NO-muhz) are solid, noncancerous breast lumps that occur most often in women between the ages of 15 and 35.	general
A fibroadenoma might feel firm, smooth, rubbery or hard and has a well-defined shape.	general
Usually painless, it might feel like a marble in your breast, moving easily under your skin when examined.	general
Fibroadenomas vary in size, and they can enlarge or shrink on their own.	general
Fibroadenomas are among the most common noncancerous (benign) breast lumps in young women.	general
Treatment might include monitoring to detect changes in size or feel, a biopsy to evaluate the lump or surgery to remove it.	general
Round with distinct, smooth borders Easily moved You can have one or many fibroadenomas in one or both breasts.	general
When to see a doctor In healthy women, normal breast tissue often feels lumpy.	general
Make an appointment with your doctor if: You detect a new breast lump You notice other changes in your breasts A breast lump you've had checked before has grown or otherwise changed and appears to be separate from the surrounding breast tissue The cause of fibroadenomas is unknown, but they might be related to reproductive hormones.	general
Fibroadenomas occur more often during your reproductive years, can become bigger during pregnancy or with use of hormone therapy, and might shrink after menopause, when hormone levels decrease.	general
Types of fibroadenomas In addition to simple fibroadenomas, there are: These can contain changes, such as an overgrowth of cells (hyperplasia) that can grow rapidly.	general
A pathologist makes the diagnosis of a complex fibroadenoma after reviewing the tissue from a biopsy.	general
Complex fibroadenomas.	general
This is the most common type of breast lump found in girls and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 18.	general
These fibroadenomas can grow large, but most shrink over time, and some disappear.	general
Juvenile fibroadenomas.	general
These can grow to larger than 2 inches (5 centimeters).	general
They might need to be removed because they can press on or replace other breast tissue.	general
Giant fibroadenomas.	general
Although usually benign, some phyllodes tumors can become cancerous (malignant).	general
Doctors usually recommend that these be removed.	general
Phyllodes tumor.	general
Complications Most fibroadenomas don't affect your risk of breast cancer.	general
However, your breast cancer risk might increase slightly if you have a complex fibroadenoma or a phyllodes tumor.	general
Fibrocystic breast changes Fibrocystic breast changes Fibrocystic breast changes lead to the development of fluid-filled round or oval sacs (cysts) and more prominent scar-like (fibrous) tissue, which can make breasts feel tender, lumpy or ropy.	general
Fibrocystic breasts are composed of tissue that feels lumpy or rope-like in texture.	general
Doctors call this nodular or glandular breast tissue.	general
It's not at all uncommon to have fibrocystic breasts.	general
More than half of women experience fibrocystic breast changes at some point in their lives.	general
"In fact, medical professionals have stopped using the term ""fibrocystic breast disease"" and now simply refer to ""fibrocystic breasts"" or ""fibrocystic breast changes"" because having fibrocystic breasts isn't really a disease."	general
Breast changes categorized as fibrocystic are considered normal.	general
Although many women with fibrocystic breasts don't have symptoms, some women experience breast pain, tenderness and lumpiness ‚Äî especially in the upper, outer area of the breasts.	general
Breast symptoms tend to be most bothersome just before menstruation.	general
Simple self-care measures can usually relieve discomfort associated with fibrocystic breasts.	general
Signs and symptoms of fibrocystic breasts may include: Breast lumps or areas of thickening that tend to blend into the surrounding breast tissue Generalized breast pain or tenderness Breast lumps that fluctuate in size with the menstrual cycle Green or dark brown nonbloody nipple discharge that tends to leak without pressure or squeezing Breast changes that are similar in both breasts Monthly increase in breast pain or lumpiness from midcycle (ovulation) to just before your period Fibrocystic breast changes occur most often in women in their 20s to 50s.	general
Rarely do postmenopausal women experience fibrocystic breast changes, unless they're on hormone therapy.	general
When to see a doctor Most fibrocystic breast changes are normal.	general
However, make an appointment with your doctor if: You find a new breast lump or area of prominent thickening You have specific areas of continuous or worsening breast pain Breast changes persist after your period Your doctor evaluated a breast lump but now it seems to be bigger or otherwise changed Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Each breast contains 15 to 20 lobes of glandular tissue, arranged like the petals of a daisy.	general
The lobes are further divided into smaller lobules that produce milk for breast-feeding.	general
Small tubes (ducts) conduct the milk to a reservoir that lies just beneath your nipple.	general
The exact cause of fibrocystic breast changes isn't known, but experts suspect that reproductive hormones ‚Äî especially estrogen ‚Äî play a role.	general
Fluctuating hormone levels during your menstrual cycle can cause breast discomfort and areas of lumpy breast tissue that feel tender, sore and swollen.	general
Fibrocystic breast changes tend to be more bothersome before your menstrual period, and the pain and lumpiness tends to clear up or lessen once your menstrual period begins.	general
When examined under a microscope, fibrocystic breast tissue includes distinct components such as: Fluid-filled round or oval sacs (cysts) A prominence of scar-like fibrous tissue (fibrosis) Overgrowth of cells (hyperplasia) lining the milk ducts or milk-producing tissues (lobules) of the breast Enlarged breast lobules (adenosis) Having fibrocystic breasts doesn't increase your risk of breast cancer.	general
Fibromuscular dysplasia Fibromuscular dysplasia In fibromuscular dysplasia, the muscle and fibrous tissues in your arteries thicken, causing the arteries to narrow.	general
This may reduce blood flow to your organs, leading to organ damage.	general
"Fibromuscular dysplasia of the artery to the kidney (renal artery) is shown here, with a ""string of beads"" appearance."	general
Fibromuscular dysplasia is a condition that causes narrowing (stenosis) and enlargement (aneurysm) of the medium-sized arteries in your body.	general
Narrowed arteries may reduce blood flow and affect the function of your organs.	general
Fibromuscular dysplasia appears most commonly in the arteries leading to the kidneys and brain.	general
Fibromuscular dysplasia can affect other arteries, including those leading to your legs, heart, abdomen and rarely the arms.	general
Treatments are available, but there isn't a cure for fibromuscular dysplasia.	general
Signs or symptoms of the disease depend on what artery is affected by fibromuscular dysplasia.	general
Sometimes, more than artery is narrowed.	general
Many people who have fibromuscular dysplasia don't have any symptoms.	general
Kidney signs and symptoms If the arteries leading to your kidneys (renal arteries) are affected, you may have: High blood pressure Chronic kidney failure (rarely) Brain signs and symptoms If the arteries leading to your brain (carotid arteries) are affected, you may have: Difficulty speaking Abdominal signs and symptoms If the arteries leading to your abdomen (mesenteric arteries) are affected, you may have: Abdominal pain after eating Heart signs and symptoms Fibromuscular dysplasia often occurs with tears in the walls of your coronary arteries, also called arterial dissection or spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD).	general
But the exact connection between these two conditions isn't yet clear.	general
If the arteries leading to your heart (coronary arteries) are affected, you may have: Leg and arm signs and symptoms If the arteries leading to your arms or legs (peripheral arteries) are affected, you may have: Discomfort when moving your legs, feet, arms or hands When to see a doctor If you have fibromuscular dysplasia, seek medical attention immediately if you have any of these signs and symptoms: Sudden changes in your vision Sudden changes in your ability to speak Sudden or new weakness in your arms or legs If you have any of the other signs or symptoms listed and are concerned about your risk of fibromuscular dysplasia, see your doctor.	general
Fibromuscular dysplasia can be passed down through families (inherited).	general
Talk to your doctor about your family health history so together you can be alert to changes that might suggest you have fibromuscular dysplasia.	general
There's currently no genetic test for fibromuscular dysplasia.	general
The cause of fibromuscular dysplasia is unknown.	general
However, several factors may play a role.	general
If someone in your family has fibromuscular dysplasia, you might get the condition, too.	general
It might occur in a different artery or you may have a milder or more severe case.	general
Or, you may never get fibromuscular dysplasia at all.	general
Not everyone who has fibromuscular dysplasia has a relative with the disease.	general
Women have fibromuscular dysplasia more often than men do, so researchers think hormones may play a role in the development of the disease.	general
But exactly how is unclear.	general
Fibromuscular dysplasia is not linked to a woman's use of birth control pills, number of pregnancies, or age when they gave birth.	general
A lack of oxygen to the arteries or the use of certain medications or tobacco can cause the arteries to develop abnormally, leading to reduced blood flow.	general
Sometimes, the arteries may be positioned abnormally.	general
Abnormally formed arteries.	general
Risk factors Several things can make you more likely to get fibromuscular dysplasia.	general
Women have a much greater risk of fibromuscular dysplasia than do men.	general
Fibromuscular disorder tends to be diagnosed in people in their early 50s.	general
If you smoke, quit.	general
People who smoke appear to have an increased risk of developing fibromuscular dysplasia.	general
For those already diagnosed with the disease, smoking increases the risk for more serious fibromuscular dysplasia.	general
Complications Fibromuscular dysplasia can cause a number of complications.	general
These include: A common complication of fibromuscular dysplasia is high blood pressure.	general
The narrowing of the arteries causes higher pressure on your artery walls, which can lead to further artery damage, heart disease or heart failure.	general
High blood pressure.	general
Fibromuscular dysplasia and tears in the walls of your arteries often occur together.	general
This process, called arterial dissection or spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), can limit blood flow to the organ supplied by the injured artery.	general
This can affect any artery.	general
Dissected artery.	general
Fibromuscular dysplasia can weaken the walls of your arteries, creating a bulge called an aneurysm.	general
If an aneurysm ruptures, it can be a life-threatening emergency.	general
An aneurysm can occur in any artery affected by fibromuscular dysplasia.	general
If you have a dissected artery leading to your brain or if an aneurysm in an artery to your brain ruptures, you can have a stroke.	general
High blood pressure can also increase your risk of a stroke.	general
Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues.	general
Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals.	general
Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress.	general
In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event.	general
Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men.	general
Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression.	general
While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms.	general
Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help.	general
Products & Services Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months.	general
To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist.	general
Widespread pain.	general
People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time.	general
Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea.	general
"A symptom commonly referred to as ""fibro fog"" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks."	general
Cognitive difficulties.	general
Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: Irritable bowel syndrome Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together.	general
These may include: Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder.	general
Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia.	general
Infections.	general
Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident.	general
Psychological stress may also trigger the condition.	general
Physical or emotional trauma.	general
Why does it hurt?	general
Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change.	general
This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters).	general
In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals.	general
More Information Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men.	general
You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition.	general
Family history.	general
If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia.	general
Other disorders.	general
Complications The pain and lack of sleep associated with fibromyalgia can interfere with your ability to function at home or on the job.	general
The frustration of dealing with an often-misunderstood condition also can result in depression and health-related anxiety.	general
Interstitial (in-tur-STISH-ul) lung disease describes a large group of disorders, most of which cause progressive scarring of lung tissue.	general
The scarring associated with interstitial lung disease eventually affects your ability to breathe and get enough oxygen into your bloodstream.	general
Interstitial lung disease can be caused by long-term exposure to hazardous materials, such as asbestos.	general
Some types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also can cause interstitial lung disease.	general
In some cases, however, the causes remain unknown.	general
Once lung scarring occurs, it's generally irreversible.	general
Medications may slow the damage of interstitial lung disease, but many people never regain full use of their lungs.	general
Lung transplant is an option for some people who have interstitial lung disease.	general
The primary signs and symptoms of interstitial lung disease are: Shortness of breath at rest or aggravated by exertion When to see a doctor By the time symptoms appear, irreversible lung damage has often already occurred.	general
Nevertheless, it's important to see your doctor at the first sign of breathing problems.	general
Many conditions other than interstitial lung disease can affect your lungs, and getting an early and accurate diagnosis is important for proper treatment.	general
Bronchioles and alveoli in the lungs Bronchioles and alveoli in the lungs Within your lungs, the main airways (bronchi) branch off into smaller and smaller passageways, the smallest of which are called bronchioles.	general
At the end of the bronchioles are tiny air sacs (alveoli).	general
Interstitial lung disease seems to occur when an injury to your lungs triggers an abnormal healing response.	general
Ordinarily, your body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage.	general
But in interstitial lung disease, the repair process goes awry and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened.	general
This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into your bloodstream.	general
Interstitial lung disease can be triggered by many different things ‚Äî including airborne toxins in the workplace, drugs and some types of medical treatments.	general
In most cases, the causes are unknown.	general
Occupational and environmental factors Long-term exposure to a number of toxins and pollutants can damage your lungs.	general
These may include: Silica dust Asbestos fibers Indoor hot tubs Some people who receive radiation therapy for lung or breast cancer show signs of lung damage months or sometimes years after the initial treatment.	general
Medications Many drugs can damage your lungs, especially: Drugs designed to kill cancer cells, such as methotrexate (Otrexup, Trexall, others) and cyclophosphamide, can also damage lung tissue.	general
Chemotherapy drugs.	general
Some drugs used to treat irregular heartbeats, such as amiodarone (Nexterone, Pacerone) or propranolol (Inderal, Innopran), may harm lung tissue.	general
Heart medications.	general
Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin, others) and ethambutol (Myambutol) can cause lung damage.	general
Some antibiotics.	general
Certain anti-inflammatory drugs, such as rituximab (Rituxan) or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), can cause lung damage.	general
Anti-inflammatory drugs.	general
Medical conditions Lung damage can also result from autoimmune diseases such as: Rheumatoid arthritis Sarcoidosis The list of substances and conditions that can lead to interstitial lung disease is long.	general
Even so, in some cases, the causes are never found.	general
Disorders without a known cause are grouped together under the label of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, the most common and deadly of which is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.	general
Risk factors Factors that may make you more susceptible to interstitial lung disease include: Interstitial lung disease is much more likely to affect adults, although infants and children sometimes develop the disorder.	general
If you work in mining, farming or construction or for any reason are exposed to pollutants known to damage your lungs, your risk of interstitial lung disease is increased.	general
Exposure to occupational and environmental toxins.	general
If you have uncontrolled acid reflux or indigestion, you may be at increased risk of interstitial lung disease.	general
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.	general
Some forms of interstitial lung disease are more likely to occur in people with a history of smoking, and active smoking may make the condition worse, especially if there is associated emphysema.	general
Having radiation treatments to your chest or using some chemotherapy drugs makes it more likely that you'll develop lung disease.	general
Radiation and chemotherapy.	general
Complications Interstitial lung disease can lead to a series of life-threatening complications, including: Unlike systemic high blood pressure, this condition affects only the arteries in your lungs.	general
It begins when scar tissue or low oxygen levels restrict the smallest blood vessels, limiting blood flow in your lungs.	general
This in turn raises pressure within the pulmonary arteries.	general
Pulmonary hypertension is a serious illness that becomes progressively worse.	general
High blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension).	general
This serious condition occurs when your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) ‚Äî which is less muscular than the left ‚Äî has to pump harder than usual to move blood through obstructed pulmonary arteries.	general
Eventually the right ventricle fails from the extra strain.	general
This is often a consequence of pulmonary hypertension.	general
Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale).	general
In the end stage of chronic interstitial lung disease, respiratory failure occurs when severely low blood oxygen levels along with rising pressures in the pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle cause heart failure.	general
Respiratory failure.	general
Fibrous dysplasia is an uncommon bone disorder in which scar-like (fibrous) tissue develops in place of normal bone.	general
This irregular tissue can weaken the affected bone and cause it to deform or fracture.	general
In most cases, fibrous dysplasia occurs at a single site in one bone, but can occur at multiple sites in multiple bones.	general
Single bone involvement usually occurs in adolescents and young adults.	general
People who have more than one affected bone typically develop symptoms before the age of 10.	general
Although fibrous dysplasia is a genetic disorder, it's caused by a gene mutation that's not passed from parent to child.	general
There's no cure for the disorder.	general
Treatment, which may include surgery, focuses on relieving pain and repairing or stabilizing bones.	general
Fibrous dysplasia may cause few or no signs and symptoms, particularly if the condition is mild.	general
More severe fibrous dysplasia may cause: Bone pain, usually a mild to moderate dull ache Curvature of leg bones Fibrous dysplasia can affect any bone in the body, but the most commonly affected bones include the following: Thighbone (femur) Shinbone (tibia) Rarely, fibrous dysplasia may be associated with a syndrome that affects the hormone-producing glands of your endocrine system.	general
These abnormalities may include: Very early puberty Overactive hormone production Light brown spots on the skin Increased bone pain also may be associated with the normal hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle or pregnancy.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you or your child develops any of the following: Bone pain that increases with weight-bearing activity or doesn't go away with rest Bone pain that interrupts sleep Difficulty walking or limping Fibrous dysplasia is linked to a gene mutation present in certain cells that produce bone.	general
The mutation results in the production of immature and irregular bone tissue.	general
Most often the irregular bone tissue (lesion) is present at a single site on one bone.	general
Less often multiple bones are affected, and there may be more than one lesion on multiple bones.	general
A lesion usually stops growing sometime during puberty.	general
However, lesions may grow again during pregnancy.	general
The gene mutation associated with fibrous dysplasia occurs after conception, in the early stages of fetal development.	general
Therefore, the mutation isn't inherited from your parents, and you can't pass it on to your children.	general
Complications Severe fibrous dysplasia can cause: The weakened area of an affected bone can cause the bone to bend.	general
These weakened bones also are more likely to fracture.	general
Bone deformity or fracture.	general
The nerves to your eyes and ears may be surrounded by affected bone.	general
Severe deformity of facial bones can lead to loss of vision and hearing, but it's a rare complication.	general
Vision and hearing loss.	general
If leg and pelvic bones are deformed, arthritis may form in the joints of those bones.	general
Rarely, an affected area of bone can become cancerous.	general
This rare complication usually only affects people who have had prior radiation therapy.	general
Floor of the mouth cancer is cancer that begins on the tissue underneath your tongue.	general
Floor of the mouth cancer most often begins in the thin, flat cells that line the inside of your mouth (squamous cells).	general
Changes in the look and feel of the tissue on the floor of the mouth, such as a lump or a sore that doesn't heal, are often the first signs of floor of the mouth cancer.	general
Floor of the mouth cancer treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.	general
Signs and symptoms of floor of the mouth cancer can include: Loose teeth White patches in your mouth that won't go away When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor or dentist about any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.	general
Floor of the mouth cancer forms when a genetic mutation turns normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells.	general
Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time.	general
Abnormal cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die.	general
The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor).	general
Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can separate from an initial tumor to spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.	general
Risk factors Things that may increase the rison of floor of the mouth cancer include: Using tobacco Drinking alcohol Taking medications that suppress your immune system If you use tobacco and drink alcohol, the risk is even higher.	general
Ways to reduce your risk of floor of the mouth cancer include: If you don't use tobacco, don't start.	general
If you currently use tobacco of any kind, talk with your doctor about strategies to help you quit.	general
Don't use tobacco.	general
If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation.	general
For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.	general
Limit alcohol if you choose to drink.	general
During your appointment, your dentist will check your mouth for signs of cancer and precancerous changes.	general
Get regular dental care.	general
Receiving a vaccination to prevent HPV infection may reduce your risk of HPV-related cancers, such as mouth cancer.	general
Ask your doctor whether an HPV vaccine is appropriate for you.	general
Consider the HPV vaccine.	general
Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system ‚Äî your nose, throat and lungs.	general
"Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach ""flu"" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting."	general
For most people, influenza resolves on its own.	general
But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly.	general
People at higher risk of developing flu complications include: Young children under age 5, and especially those under 12 months Adults older than age 65 Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities Pregnant women and women up to two weeks postpartum People with weakened immune systems People who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes People who are very obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher Though the annual influenza vaccine isn't 100 percent effective, it's still your best defense against the flu.	general
Initially, the flu may seem like a common cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat.	general
But colds usually develop slowly, whereas the flu tends to come on suddenly.	general
And although a cold can be a nuisance, you usually feel much worse with the flu.	general
Common signs and symptoms of the flu include: Fever over 100.	general
4 F (38 C) Aching muscles When to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can treat themselves at home and often don't need to see a doctor.	general
If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your doctor right away.	general
Taking antiviral drugs may reduce the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.	general
More Information Flu viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks.	general
You can inhale the droplets directly, or you can pick up the germs from an object ‚Äî such as a telephone or computer keyboard ‚Äî and then transfer them to your eyes, nose or mouth.	general
People with the virus are likely contagious from the day or so before symptoms first appear until about five days after symptoms begin.	general
Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.	general
Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing regularly.	general
If you've had influenza in the past, your body has already made antibodies to fight that particular strain of the virus.	general
If future influenza viruses are similar to those you've encountered before, either by having the disease or by getting vaccinated, those antibodies may prevent infection or lessen its severity.	general
But antibodies against flu viruses you've encountered in the past can't protect you from new influenza strains that can be very different immunologically from what you had before.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of developing influenza or its complications include: Seasonal influenza tends to target children younger than 12 months of age and adults 65 years old or older.	general
People who live or work in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes or military barracks, are more likely to develop influenza.	general
People who are hospitalized are also at higher risk.	general
Living or working conditions.	general
Cancer treatments, anti-rejection drugs, long-term use of steroids, organ transplant, blood cancer or HIV/AIDS can weaken your immune system.	general
This can make it easier for you to catch influenza and may also increase your risk of developing complications.	general
Weakened immune system.	general
Chronic conditions, including lung diseases such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, neurological or neurodevelopmental disease, an airway abnormality, and kidney, liver or blood disease, may increase your risk of influenza complications.	general
Chronic illnesses.	general
People who are younger than 19 years of age and receiving long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with influenza.	general
Aspirin use under age 19.	general
Pregnant women are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.	general
Women who are up to two weeks postpartum also are more likely to develop influenza-related complications.	general
People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more have an increased risk of complications from the flu.	general
Complications If you're young and healthy, seasonal influenza usually isn't serious.	general
Although you may feel miserable while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.	general
But children and adults at high risk may develop complications such as: Asthma flare-ups Heart problems Ear infections Pneumonia is the most serious complication.	general
For older adults and people with a chronic illness, pneumonia can be deadly.	general
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone age 6 months or older.	general
Each year's seasonal flu vaccine contains protection from the three or four influenza viruses that are expected to be the most common during that year's flu season.	general
This year, the vaccine will be available as an injection and as a nasal spray.	general
In recent years, there was concern that the nasal spray vaccine wasn't effective enough against certain types of flu.	general
However, the nasal spray vaccine is expected to be effective in the 2019-2020 season.	general
The nasal spray still isn't recommended for some groups, such as pregnant women, children between 2 and 4 years old with asthma or wheezing, and people who have compromised immune systems.	general
Most types of flu vaccines contain a small amount of egg protein.	general
If you have a mild egg allergy ‚Äî you get hives only from eating eggs, for example ‚Äî you can receive the flu shot without any additional precautions.	general
If you have a severe egg allergy, you should be vaccinated in a medical setting and be supervised by a doctor who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions.	general
Mayo Clinic Minute: Why you need your flu shot now Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: Why you need your flu shot now Seasonal flu is a virus that attacks your respiratory system.	general
Most people get better on their own, but, for some, the flu can be serious.	general
Vivien Williams: Our babies, our younger children and our older adults definitely can get more sick from the flu.	general
Patients who are already sick with other chronic conditions, are undergoing chemotherapy are more likely to have complications from the flu as well.	general
Tina Ardon, M.D.: Complications include bronchitis, pneumonia and even heart problems.	general
Vivien Williams: The vaccine for influenza is one our best defenses we have.	general
Dr. Tina Ardon says some people don't get the flu vaccine because they think it could cause the flu.	general
Vivien Williams: The flu vaccine is what we call a dead vaccine.	general
So you cannot get the actual flu from the flu vaccine.	general
You can't get the flu from a flu shot.	general
FluMist, while safe for most people, contains a weakened form of the virus, so people with certain conditions should get a shot instead.	general
Vivien Williams: Everyone who can get it should get it.	general
It takes two weeks for the vaccine to work, so get your flu shot now.	general
For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams.	general
Vivien Williams: Mayo Clinic Minute: The facts about three flu vaccine myths Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: The facts about three flu vaccine myths Influenza myth No.	general
1: The flu is like a cold.	general
It will make you feel awful, but it isn't really harmful.	general
Fact.	general
Well, in the U.S. alone, last year 80,000 Americans died from influenza and its complications, and almost a million were hospitalized.	general
Gregory Poland, M.D.: The complications are the really dangerous part.	general
Dr. Gregory Poland says influenza commonly leads to deadly pneumonia, meningitis, heart attacks, and complications for people with diabetes.	general
Myth No.	general
2: I always get the flu from the flu shot.	general
Fact.	general
It is impossible to get influenza from the vaccine.	general
Dr. Poland: Dr. Poland says it's not uncommon for people to coincidentally get an upper respiratory infection in the weeks after getting a flu shot and assume it's connected.	general
But he says studies have proven your odds of getting that minor upper respiratory infection from other viruses are identical whether you get the flu shot or not, so you might as well protect yourself from the more serious influenza.	general
And myth No.	general
3: Science still doesn't know enough about vaccines to know if they're safe.	general
Fact.	general
Dr. Poland says vaccines are among the safest and most studied areas of modern medicine.	general
In fact, it takes more study and research to get a vaccine approved than it does for an over-the-counter headache medicine like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.	general
For the Mayo clinic News Network, I'm Ian Roth.	general
Controlling the spread of infection The influenza vaccine isn't 100 percent effective, so it's also important to take measures such as these to reduce the spread of infection: Thorough and frequent hand-washing is an effective way to prevent many common infections.	general
Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers if soap and water aren't readily available.	general
Wash your hands.	general
Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough.	general
To avoid contaminating your hands, cough or sneeze into a tissue or into the inner crook of your elbow.	general
Contain your coughs and sneezes.	general
The flu spreads easily wherever people congregate ‚Äî in child care centers, schools, office buildings, auditoriums and public transportation.	general
By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you reduce your chances of infection.	general
And if you're sick, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever subsides so that you lessen your chance of infecting others.	general
Avoid crowds.	general
"Technically, the term ""swine flu"" refers to influenza in pigs."	general
Occasionally, pigs transmit influenza viruses to people, mainly to hog farmers and veterinarians.	general
Less often, someone infected with swine flu passes the infection to others.	general
In the spring of 2009, scientists recognized a particular strain of flu virus known as H1N1.	general
This virus is actually a combination of viruses from pigs, birds and humans.	general
During the 2009-10 flu season, H1N1 caused the respiratory infection in humans that was commonly referred to as swine flu.	general
Because so many people around the world got sick that year, the World Health Organization declared the flu caused by H1N1 to be a global pandemic.	general
In August 2010, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over.	general
Since that time, scientists have changed the way they name viruses.	general
The H1N1 virus is now known as H1N1v.	general
The v stands for variant and indicates that the virus normally circulates in animals but has been detected in humans.	general
Since 2011, another strain, H3N2v, has been circulating in humans and also causes the flu.	general
Both strains are included in the flu vaccine for 2018-19.	general
The signs and symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of infections caused by other flu strains and can include: Fever (but not always) Nausea and vomiting Flu symptoms develop about one to three days after you're exposed to the virus.	general
When to see a doctor It's not necessary to see a doctor if you're generally healthy and develop flu signs and symptoms, such as fever, cough and body aches.	general
Call your doctor, however, if you have flu symptoms and you're pregnant or you have a chronic disease, such as asthma, emphysema, diabetes or a heart condition, because you have a higher risk of complications from the flu.	general
More Information Influenza viruses infect the cells that line your nose, throat and lungs.	general
The virus enters your body when you inhale contaminated droplets or transfer live virus from a contaminated surface to your eyes, nose or mouth.	general
You can't catch swine flu from eating pork.	general
Risk factors If you've lived in or traveled to an area where many people are affected by swine flu, you may have been exposed to the virus.	general
Swine farmers and veterinarians have the highest risk of exposure to true swine flu because they work with and are near pigs.	general
Complications Worsening of chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma Respiratory failure More Information The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone age 6 months or older.	general
Flu vaccines for 2018-19 protect against the viruses that cause swine flu and one or two other viruses that are expected to be the most common during flu season.	general
The vaccine is available as an injection or a nasal spray.	general
The nasal spray is approved for use in healthy people 2 through 49 years of age who are not pregnant.	general
The nasal spray isn't recommended for some groups, such as pregnant women, children between 2 and 4 years old with asthma or wheezing, and people who have compromised immune systems.	general
These measures also help prevent flu and limit its spread: If you have the flu, you can give it to others.	general
Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone.	general
Stay home if you're sick.	general
Use soap and water, or if they're unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.	general
Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently.	general
Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough.	general
Wear a face mask if you have one.	general
To avoid contaminating your hands, cough or sneeze into a tissue or the inner crook of your elbow.	general
Contain your coughs and sneezes.	general
Stay away from crowds if possible.	general
And if you're at high risk of complications from the flu ‚Äî for example, you're younger than 5 or you're 65 or older, you're pregnant, or you have a chronic medical condition such as asthma ‚Äî consider avoiding swine barns at seasonal fairs and elsewhere.	general
Avoid contact.	general
Pericardial effusion (per-e-KAHR-dee-ul uh-FU-zhun) is the accumulation of too much fluid in the double-layered, sac-like structure around the heart (pericardium).	general
The space between the layers normally contains a thin layer of fluid.	general
But if the pericardium is diseased or injured, the resulting inflammation can lead to excess fluid.	general
Fluid can also build up around the heart without inflammation, such as from bleeding after a chest trauma.	general
Pericardial effusion puts pressure on the heart, affecting the heart's function.	general
If untreated, it can lead to heart failure or death.	general
You can have significant pericardial effusion without signs or symptoms, particularly if the fluid has increased slowly.	general
If pericardial effusion symptoms do occur, they might include: Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (dyspnea) Discomfort when breathing while lying down (orthopnea) Chest pain, usually behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest Chest fullness When to see a doctor Call 911 or your local emergency number if you feel chest pain that lasts more than a few minutes, if your breathing is difficult or painful, or if you have an unexplained fainting spell.	general
See your doctor if you have shortness of breath.	general
Pericardial effusion can result from inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) in response to illness or injury.	general
Pericardial effusion can also occur when the flow of pericardial fluids is blocked or when blood accumulates within the pericardium, such as from a chest trauma.	general
Sometimes the cause can't be determined (idiopathic pericarditis).	general
Causes of pericardial effusion can include: Inflammation of the pericardium following heart surgery or a heart attack Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus Spread of cancer (metastasis), particularly lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease Cancer of the pericardium or heart Radiation therapy for cancer if the heart was within the field of radiation Chemotherapy treatment for cancer, such as doxorubicin (Doxil) and cyclophosphamide Waste products in the blood due to kidney failure (uremia) Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) Trauma or puncture wound near the heart Certain prescription drugs, including hydralazine, a medication for high blood pressure; isoniazid, a tuberculosis drug; and phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek, others), a medication for epileptic seizures Complications Depending on how quickly pericardial effusion develops, the pericardium can stretch somewhat to accommodate the excess fluid.	general
However, too much fluid causes the pericardium to put pressure on the heart, which keeps the chambers from filling completely.	general
This condition, called tamponade (tam-pon-AYD), results in poor blood circulation and an inadequate supply of oxygen to the body.	general
Tamponade is life-threatening and requires emergent/urgent attention.	general
Normal and Scarred Glomerulus Normal and Scarred Glomerulus Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) results from scarring of the glomeruli, the tiny structures within the kidney that filter impurities from the blood to create urine.	general
As these scars accumulate, kidney function worsens.	general
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a disease in which scar tissue develops on the parts of the kidneys that filter waste from the blood (glomeruli).	general
FSGS can be caused by a variety of conditions.	general
FSGS is a serious condition that can lead to kidney failure, for which the only treatment options are dialysis or kidney transplant.	general
Treatment options for FSGS depend on the type you have.	general
Types of FSGS include: Many people diagnosed with FSGS have no known cause for their condition.	general
This is called primary (idiopathic) FSGS.	general
Primary FSGS.	general
Several factors, such as infection, drug toxicity, diseases such as diabetes or sickle cell disease, obesity, and even other kidney diseases can cause secondary FSGS.	general
Controlling or treating the underlying cause often halts ongoing kidney damage and might lead to improved kidney function over time.	general
Secondary FSGS.	general
This rare form of FSGS is caused by genetic mutations.	general
It's suspected when several members of a family show signs of FSGS.	general
Familial FSGS can also occur when neither parent has the disease, but each carries one copy of an abnormal gene that can be passed on to the next generation.	general
Genetic (also called familial) FSGS.	general
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, can be caused by a variety of conditions, like diabetes, sickle cell disease, other kidney diseases, and obesity.	general
It can also be caused by an infection and drug toxicity.	general
A rare form of FSGS is caused by inherited abnormal genes.	general
Sometimes there's no identifiable cause.	general
Clinical trials testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.	general
Food poisoning, also called foodborne illness, is illness caused by eating contaminated food.	general
Infectious organisms ‚Äî including bacteria, viruses and parasites ‚Äî or their toxins are the most common causes of food poisoning.	general
Infectious organisms or their toxins can contaminate food at any point of processing or production.	general
Contamination can also occur at home if food is incorrectly handled or cooked.	general
Food poisoning symptoms, which can start within hours of eating contaminated food, often include nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.	general
Most often, food poisoning is mild and resolves without treatment.	general
But some people need to go to the hospital.	general
Food poisoning symptoms vary with the source of contamination.	general
Most types of food poisoning cause one or more of the following signs and symptoms: Signs and symptoms may start within hours after eating the contaminated food, or they may begin days or even weeks later.	general
Sickness caused by food poisoning generally lasts from a few hours to several days.	general
When to see a doctor If you experience any of the following signs or symptoms, seek medical attention.	general
Frequent episodes of vomiting and inability to keep liquids down Bloody vomit or stools An oral temperature higher than 100.	general
4 F (38 C) Signs or symptoms of dehydration ‚Äî excessive thirst, dry mouth, little or no urination, severe weakness, dizziness, or lightheadedness Neurological symptoms such as blurry vision, muscle weakness and tingling in the arms Contamination of food can happen at any point of production: growing, harvesting, processing, storing, shipping or preparing.	general
Cross-contamination ‚Äî the transfer of harmful organisms from one surface to another ‚Äî is often the cause.	general
This is especially troublesome for raw, ready-to-eat foods, such as salads or other produce.	general
Because these foods aren't cooked, harmful organisms aren't destroyed before eating and can cause food poisoning.	general
Many bacterial, viral or parasitic agents cause food poisoning.	general
The following table shows some of the possible contaminants, when you might start to feel symptoms and common ways the organism is spread.	general
Contaminant Campylobacter 2 to 5 days Meat and poultry.	general
Contamination occurs during processing if animal feces contact meat surfaces.	general
Other sources include unpasteurized milk and contaminated water.	general
Clostridium botulinum 12 to 72 hours Home-canned foods with low acidity, improperly canned commercial foods, smoked or salted fish, potatoes baked in aluminum foil, and other foods kept at warm temperatures for too long.	general
Clostridium perfringens 8 to 16 hours Meats, stews and gravies.	general
Commonly spread when serving dishes don't keep food hot enough or food is chilled too slowly.	general
Escherichia coli (E.	general
coli) O157:H7 1 to 8 days Beef contaminated with feces during slaughter.	general
Spread mainly by undercooked ground beef.	general
Other sources include unpasteurized milk and apple cider, alfalfa sprouts, and contaminated water.	general
Giardia lamblia 1 to 2 weeks Raw, ready-to-eat produce and contaminated water.	general
Can be spread by an infected food handler.	general
Hepatitis A Raw, ready-to-eat produce and shellfish from contaminated water.	general
Can be spread by an infected food handler.	general
9 to 48 hours Hot dogs, luncheon meats, unpasteurized milk and cheeses, and unwashed raw produce.	general
Can be spread through contaminated soil and water.	general
Noroviruses (Norwalk-like viruses) 12 to 48 hours Raw, ready-to-eat produce and shellfish from contaminated water.	general
Can be spread by an infected food handler.	general
1 to 3 days Raw, ready-to-eat produce.	general
Can be spread by an infected food handler.	general
1 to 3 days Raw or contaminated meat, poultry, milk, or egg yolks.	general
Survives inadequate cooking.	general
Can be spread by knives, cutting surfaces or an infected food handler.	general
24 to 48 hours Seafood and raw, ready-to-eat produce.	general
Can be spread by an infected food handler.	general
Staphylococcus aureus 1 to 6 hours Meats and prepared salads, cream sauces, and cream-filled pastries.	general
Can be spread by hand contact, coughing and sneezing.	general
Vibrio vulnificus 1 to 7 days Raw oysters and raw or undercooked mussels, clams, and whole scallops.	general
Can be spread through contaminated seawater.	general
Risk factors Whether you become ill after eating contaminated food depends on the organism, the amount of exposure, your age and your health.	general
High-risk groups include: As you get older, your immune system may not respond as quickly and as effectively to infectious organisms as when you were younger.	general
Older adults.	general
During pregnancy, changes in metabolism and circulation may increase the risk of food poisoning.	general
Your reaction may be more severe during pregnancy.	general
Rarely, your baby may get sick, too.	general
Pregnant women.	general
Their immune systems haven't fully developed.	general
Infants and young children.	general
Having a chronic condition ‚Äî such as diabetes, liver disease or AIDS ‚Äî or receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer reduces your immune response.	general
People with chronic disease.	general
Complications The most common serious complication of food poisoning is dehydration ‚Äî a severe loss of water and essential salts and minerals.	general
If you're a healthy adult and drink enough to replace fluids you lose from vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration shouldn't be a problem.	general
Infants, older adults and people with suppressed immune systems or chronic illnesses may become severely dehydrated when they lose more fluids than they can replace.	general
In that case, they may need to be hospitalized and receive intravenous fluids.	general
In extreme cases, dehydration can be fatal.	general
Some types of food poisoning have potentially serious complications for certain people.	general
These include: Complications of a listeria food poisoning may be most severe for an unborn baby.	general
Early in pregnancy, a listeria infection may lead to miscarriage.	general
Later in pregnancy, a listeria infection may lead to stillbirth, premature birth or a potentially fatal infection in the baby after birth ‚Äî even if the mother was only mildly ill.	general
Infants who survive a listeria infection may experience long-term neurological damage and delayed development.	general
Listeria monocytogenes.	general
Certain E. coli strains can cause a serious complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome.	general
This syndrome damages the lining of the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, sometimes leading to kidney failure.	general
Older adults, children younger than 5 and people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk of developing this complication.	general
If you're in one of these risk categories, see your doctor at the first sign of profuse or bloody diarrhea.	general
Escherichia coli (E.	general
coli).	general
To prevent food poisoning at home: Wash your hands well with warm, soapy water before and after handling or preparing food.	general
Use hot, soapy water to wash utensils, cutting boards and other surfaces you use.	general
Wash your hands, utensils and food surfaces often.	general
When shopping, preparing food or storing food, keep raw meat, poultry, fish and shellfish away from other foods.	general
This prevents cross-contamination.	general
Keep raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods.	general
The best way to tell if foods are cooked to a safe temperature is to use a food thermometer.	general
You can kill harmful organisms in most foods by cooking them to the right temperature.	general
Cook foods to a safe temperature.	general
Cook ground beef to 160 F (71.	general
1 C); steaks, roasts and chops, such as lamb, pork and veal, to at least 145 F (62.	general
8 C).	general
Cook chicken and turkey to 165 F (73.	general
9 C).	general
Make sure fish and shellfish are cooked thoroughly.	general
‚Äî within two hours of purchasing or preparing them.	general
If the room temperature is above 90 F (32.	general
2 C), refrigerate perishable foods within one hour.	general
Refrigerate or freeze perishable foods promptly Don't thaw food at room temperature.	general
The safest way to thaw food is to defrost it in the refrigerator.	general
"If you microwave frozen food using the ""defrost"" or ""50 percent power"" setting, be sure to cook it immediately."	general
Defrost food safely.	general
If you aren't sure if a food has been prepared, served or stored safely, discard it.	general
Food left at room temperature too long may contain bacteria or toxins that can't be destroyed by cooking.	general
Don't taste food that you're unsure about ‚Äî just throw it out.	general
Even if it looks and smells fine, it may not be safe to eat.	general
Throw it out when in doubt.	general
Food poisoning is especially serious and potentially life-threatening for young children, pregnant women and their fetuses, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.	general
A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a hole in the heart that didn't close the way it should after birth.	general
During fetal development, a small flap-like opening ‚Äî the foramen ovale (foh-RAY-mun oh-VAY-lee) ‚Äî is normally present in the wall between the right and left upper chambers of the heart (atria).	general
It normally closes during infancy.	general
When the foramen ovale doesn't close, it's called a patent foramen ovale.	general
Patent foramen ovale occurs in about 25 percent of the normal population, but most people with the condition never know they have it.	general
A patent foramen ovale is often discovered during tests for other problems.	general
Learning that you have a patent foramen ovale is understandably concerning, but most people never need treatment for this disorder.	general
Most people with a patent foramen ovale don't know they have it, because it's usually a hidden condition that doesn't create signs or symptoms.	general
Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers.	general
The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood.	general
The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart.	general
The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.	general
It's unclear what causes the foramen ovale to stay open in some people, though genetics may play a role.	general
An overview of normal heart function in a child or adult is helpful in understanding the role of the foramen ovale before birth.	general
Normal heart function after birth Your heart has four pumping chambers that circulate your blood: The upper right chamber (right atrium) receives oxygen-poor blood from your body and pumps it into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve.	general
The right atrium.	general
The lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps the blood through a large vessel called the pulmonary artery and into the lungs, where the blood is resupplied with oxygen and carbon dioxide is removed from the blood.	general
The blood is pumped through the pulmonary valve, which closes when the right ventricle relaxes between beats.	general
The right ventricle.	general
The upper left chamber (left atrium) receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and pumps it into the left ventricle through the mitral valve.	general
The left atrium.	general
The lower left chamber (left ventricle) pumps the oxygen-rich blood through a large vessel called the aorta and on to the rest of the body.	general
The blood passes through the aortic valve, which also closes when the left ventricle relaxes.	general
The left ventricle.	general
Baby's heart in the womb Because a baby in the womb isn't breathing, the lungs aren't functioning yet.	general
That means there's no need to pump blood to the lungs.	general
At this stage, it's more efficient for blood to bypass the lungs and use a different route to circulate oxygen-rich blood from the mother to the baby's body.	general
The umbilical cord delivers oxygen-rich blood to the baby's right atrium.	general
Most of this blood travels through the foramen ovale and into the left atrium.	general
From there the blood goes to the left ventricle, which pumps it throughout the body.	general
Blood also travels from the right atrium to the right ventricle, which also pumps blood to the body via another bypass system.	general
Newborn baby's heart When a baby's lungs begin functioning, the circulation of blood through the heart changes.	general
Now the oxygen-rich blood comes from the lungs and enters the left atrium.	general
At this point, blood circulation follows the normal circulatory route.	general
The pressure of the blood pumping through the heart usually forces the flap opening of the foramen ovale closed.	general
In most people, the opening fuses shut, usually sometime during infancy.	general
Complications Patent foramen ovale Patent foramen ovale A patent foramen ovale is a small, flap-like opening in the wall between the right and left upper chambers of the heart.	general
It usually causes no signs or symptoms and rarely requires treatment.	general
Generally, a patent foramen ovale doesn't cause complications.	general
But some studies have found the disorder is more common in people with certain conditions, such as unexplained strokes and migraines with aura.	general
In most cases, there are other reasons for these neurologic conditions, and it's just a coincidence the person also has a patent foramen ovale.	general
However, in some cases, small blood clots in the heart may move through a patent foramen ovale, travel to the brain and cause a stroke.	general
The possible link between a patent foramen ovale and a stroke or migraine is controversial, and research studies are ongoing.	general
In rare cases a patent foramen ovale can cause a significant amount of blood to bypass the lungs, resulting in low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia).	general
In decompression illness, which can occur in scuba diving, an air blood clot can travel through a patent foramen ovale.	general
In some cases, other heart defects may be present in addition to a patent foramen ovale.	general
Greenstick fracture Greenstick fracture A greenstick fracture occurs when a bone bends and cracks, instead of breaking completely into separate pieces.	general
"The fracture looks similar to what happens when you try to break a small, ""green"" branch on a tree."	general
A greenstick fracture occurs when a bone bends and cracks, instead of breaking completely into separate pieces.	general
"The fracture looks similar to what happens when you try to break a small, ""green"" branch on a tree."	general
Most greenstick fractures occur in children younger than 10 years of age.	general
This type of broken bone most commonly occurs in children because their bones are softer and more flexible than are the bones of adults.	general
Even mild greenstick fractures are usually immobilized in a cast.	general
In addition to holding the cracked pieces of the bone together so they can heal, a cast can help prevent the bone from breaking all the way through if the child falls on it again.	general
Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the greenstick fracture.	general
Mild fractures might be mistaken for sprains or bruises.	general
More-severe greenstick fractures may cause an obvious deformity, accompanied by significant pain and swelling.	general
When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if your child has persistent pain in an injured limb.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if a child is unable to bear weight or if there is obvious pain, deformity and swelling.	general
Childhood fractures most commonly occur with a fall.	general
Arm fractures are more common than leg fractures, since the common reaction is to throw out your arms to catch yourself when you fall.	general
Risk factors The risk of greenstick fractures is higher in young children because their bones are softer and more flexible than adult bones.	general
In a greenstick fracture, the bone bends and cracks instead of breaking into separate pieces.	general
Most greenstick fractures occur in children under age 10.	general
Growth plate fracture Growth plate fracture Growth plates are located near the ends of your child's bones.	general
If a fracture goes through a growth plate, it can result in a shorter or crooked limb.	general
A growth plate fracture affects the layer of growing tissue near the ends of a child's bones.	general
Growth plates are the softest and weakest sections of the skeleton ‚Äî sometimes even weaker than surrounding ligaments and tendons.	general
An injury that might cause a joint sprain for an adult can cause a growth plate fracture in a child.	general
Growth plate fractures often need immediate treatment because they can affect how the bone will grow.	general
An improperly treated growth plate fracture could result in a fractured bone ending up more crooked or shorter than its opposite limb.	general
With proper treatment, most growth plate fractures heal without complications.	general
Most growth plate fractures occur in bones of the fingers, forearm and lower leg.	general
Signs and symptoms of a growth plate fracture may include: Pain and tenderness, particularly in response to pressure on the growth plate Inability to move the affected area or to put weight or pressure on the limb Warmth and swelling at the end of a bone, near a joint When to see a doctor If you suspect a fracture, take your child to be examined by a doctor.	general
Also have your child evaluated if you notice a visible deformity in your child's arms or legs, or if your child is having trouble playing sports because of persistent pain.	general
Growth plate fractures often are caused by a fall or a blow to the limb, as might occur in: A car accident Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, running, dancing or gymnastics Recreational activities, such as biking, sledding, skiing or skateboarding Growth plate fractures can occasionally be caused by overuse, which can occur during sports training or repetitive throwing.	general
Risk factors Growth plate fractures occur twice as often in boys as in girls, because girls finish growing earlier than do boys.	general
By the age of 12, most girls' growth plates have already matured and been replaced with solid bone.	general
Complications Most growth plate fractures heal with no complications.	general
But the following factors can increase the risk of crooked, accelerated or stunted bone growth.	general
If the growth plate has been shifted, shattered or crushed, the risk of limb deformity is greater.	general
Severity of the injury.	general
Younger children have more years of growth ahead of them, so if the growth plate is permanently damaged, there is more chance of deformity developing.	general
If a child is almost done growing, permanent damage to the growth plate may cause only minimal deformity.	general
Age of the child.	general
The growth plates around the knee are more sensitive to injury.	general
A growth plate fracture at the knee can cause the leg to be shorter, longer or crooked if the growth plate has permanent damage.	general
Growth plate injuries around the wrist and shoulder usually heal without problems.	general
Location of the injury.	general
Stress fracture Stress fracture Stress fractures are tiny cracks in a bone ‚Äî most commonly, in the weight-bearing bones of the lower leg and foot.	general
Stress fractures are tiny cracks in a bone.	general
They're caused by repetitive force, often from overuse ‚Äî such as repeatedly jumping up and down or running long distances.	general
Stress fractures can also develop from normal use of a bone that's weakened by a condition such as osteoporosis.	general
Stress fractures are most common in the weight-bearing bones of the lower leg and foot.	general
Track and field athletes and military recruits who carry heavy packs over long distances are at highest risk, but anyone can sustain a stress fracture.	general
If you start a new exercise program, for example, you might develop stress fractures if you do too much too soon.	general
Products & Services At first, you might barely notice the pain associated with a stress fracture, but it tends to worsen with time.	general
The tenderness usually starts at a specific spot and decreases during rest.	general
You might have swelling around the painful area.	general
When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if your pain becomes severe or if you feel pain even when resting or at night.	general
Stress fractures often result from increasing the amount or intensity of an activity too quickly.	general
Bone adapts gradually to increased loads through remodeling, a normal process that speeds up when the load on the bone increases.	general
During remodeling, bone tissue is destroyed (resorption), then rebuilt.	general
Bones subjected to unaccustomed force without enough time for recovery resorb cells faster than your body can replace them, which makes you more susceptible to stress fractures.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of stress fractures include: Stress fractures are more common in people who engage in high-impact sports, such as track and field, basketball, tennis, dance or gymnastics.	general
Certain sports.	general
Stress fractures often occur in people who suddenly shift from a sedentary lifestyle to an active training regimen or who rapidly increase the intensity, duration or frequency of training sessions.	general
Increased activity.	general
Women, especially those who have abnormal or absent menstrual periods, are at higher risk of developing stress fractures.	general
People who have flat feet or high, rigid arches are more likely to develop stress fractures.	general
Worn footwear contributes to the problem.	general
Foot problems.	general
Conditions such as osteoporosis can weaken your bones and make it easier for stress fractures to occur.	general
Weakened bones.	general
Having had one or more stress fractures puts you at higher risk of having more.	general
Previous stress fractures.	general
Eating disorders and lack of vitamin D and calcium can make bones more likely to develop stress fractures.	general
Lack of nutrients.	general
Complications Some stress fractures don't heal properly, which can cause chronic problems.	general
If underlying causes are not taken care of, you may be at higher risk of additional stress fractures.	general
Simple steps can help you prevent stress fractures.	general
Start any new exercise program slowly and progress gradually.	general
Avoid increasing the amount you exercise by more than 10% a week.	general
Make changes slowly.	general
Make sure your shoes fit well and are appropriate for your activity.	general
If you have flat feet, ask your doctor about arch supports for your shoes.	general
Use proper footwear.	general
Add low-impact activities to your exercise regimen to avoid repetitively stressing a particular part of your body.	general
Cross-train.	general
To keep your bones strong, make sure your diet includes enough calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients.	general
Get proper nutrition.	general

Superficial frostbite, as seen here on the tip of a finger, is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin.	general
Frostbite is an injury caused by freezing of the skin and underlying tissues.	general
First your skin becomes very cold and red, then numb, hard and pale.	general
Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin.	general
Exposed skin in cold, windy weather is most vulnerable to frostbite.	general
But frostbite can occur on skin covered by gloves or other clothing.	general
Frostnip is a milder form of cold injury that doesn't cause permanent skin damage.	general
You can treat frostnip with first-aid measures, including rewarming the affected skin.	general
All other frostbite requires medical attention because it can damage skin, tissues, muscle and bones.	general
Possible complications of severe frostbite include infection and nerve damage.	general
Stages of frostbite Stages of frostbite Skin without cold damage is normal (1).	general
Frostnip (2) is mild frostbite that irritates the skin, causing redness and a cold feeling followed by numbness.	general
Frostnip doesn't permanently damage the skin and can be treated with first-aid measures.	general
With superficial frostbite (3), your skin feels warm, a sign of serious skin involvement.	general
A fluid-filled blister may appear 24 to 36 hours after rewarming the skin.	general
With deep frostbite (4), you may experience numbness.	general
Joints or muscles may no longer work.	general
Large blisters form 24 to 48 hours after rewarming.	general
Afterward, the area turns black and hard as the tissue dies.	general
Frostnip, a mild form of frostbite, irritates the skin, causing redness and a cold feeling followed by numbness.	general
Frostnip doesn't permanently damage the skin.	general
Signs and symptoms of frostbite include: At first, cold skin and a prickling feeling Hard or waxy-looking skin Blistering after rewarming, in severe cases Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin.	general
Because of skin numbness, you may not realize you have frostbite until someone else points it out.	general
Frostbite occurs in several stages: Frostnip is a mild form of frostbite.	general
Continued exposure leads to numbness in the affected area.	general
As your skin warms, you may feel pain and tingling.	general
Frostnip doesn't permanently damage the skin.	general
Superficial frostbite appears as reddened skin that turns white or pale.	general
Your skin may begin to feel warm ‚Äî a sign of serious skin involvement.	general
If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of your skin may appear mottled.	general
And you may notice stinging, burning and swelling.	general
A fluid-filled blister may appear 12 to 36 hours after rewarming the skin.	general
Superficial frostbite.	general
As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin, including the tissues that lie below.	general
Your skin turns white or bluish gray and you may experience numbness, losing all sensation of cold, pain or discomfort in the affected area.	general
Joints or muscles may no longer work.	general
Large blisters form 24 to 48 hours after rewarming.	general
Afterward, the area turns black and hard as the tissue dies.	general
Deep (severe) frostbite.	general
When to see a doctor Seek medical attention for frostbite if you experience: Signs and symptoms of superficial or deep frostbite Increased pain, swelling, redness or discharge in the area that was frostbitten New, unexplained symptoms Get emergency medical help if you suspect hypothermia, a condition in which your body loses heat faster than it can be produced.	general
Signs and symptoms of hypothermia include: Intense shivering Slurred speech What you can do in the meantime While you wait for your emergency medical help or a doctor's appointment, take appropriate self-care measures, such as: Protecting the affected area from further cold Not walking on frostbitten feet Reducing pain with ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) Frostbite occurs when skin and underlying tissues freeze.	general
The most common cause of frostbite is exposure to cold-weather conditions.	general
But it can also be caused by direct contact with ice, frozen metal or very cold liquids.	general
Specific conditions that lead to frostbite include: Wearing clothing that isn't suitable for the conditions you're in ‚Äî for example, it doesn't protect against cold, windy or wet weather or it's too tight.	general
Staying out in the cold and wind too long.	general
Risk increases as air temperature falls below 5 F (minus 15 C), even with low wind speeds.	general
In wind chill of minus 16.	general
6 F (minus 27 C), frostbite can occur on exposed skin in less than 30 minutes.	general
Touching materials such as ice, cold packs or frozen metal.	general
More Information The following factors increase the risk of frostbite: Medical conditions that affect your ability to feel or respond to cold, such as dehydration, excessive sweating, exhaustion, diabetes and poor blood flow in your limbs Alcohol or drug abuse Fear, panic or mental illness, if it inhibits good judgment or hampers your ability to respond to cold Previous frostbite or cold injury Being an infant or older adult, both of whom may have a harder time producing and retaining body heat Being at high altitude, which reduces the oxygen supply to your skin Complications Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) Joint stiffness (frostbite arthritis) Growth defects in children, if frostbite damages a bone's growth plate Gangrene ‚Äî decay and death of tissue resulting from an interruption of blood flow to the affected area ‚Äî which can result in amputation Hypothermia Frostbite can be prevented.	general
Here are tips to help you stay safe and warm.	general
Pay attention to weather forecasts and wind chill readings.	general
In very cold, windy weather, exposed skin can develop frostbite in a matter of minutes.	general
Limit time you're outdoors in cold, wet or windy weather.	general
Air trapped between the layers of clothing acts as insulation against the cold.	general
Wear windproof and waterproof outer garments to protect against wind, snow and rain.	general
Choose undergarments that wick moisture away from your skin.	general
Change out of wet clothing ‚Äî particularly gloves, hats and socks ‚Äî as soon as possible.	general
Dress in several layers of loose, warm clothing.	general
Heavy woolen or windproof materials make the best headwear for cold protection.	general
Wear a hat or headband that fully covers your ears.	general
Mittens provide better protection.	general
Or try a thin pair of glove liners made of a wicking material (such as polypropylene) under a pair of heavier gloves or mittens.	general
Wear mittens rather than gloves.	general
You might also try hand and foot warmers.	general
Be sure the foot warmers don't make your boots too tight, restricting blood flow.	general
Wear socks and sock liners that fit well, wick moisture and provide insulation.	general
Early signs of frostbite include red or pale skin, prickling, and numbness.	general
Seek warm shelter if you notice signs of frostbite.	general
Watch for signs of frostbite.	general
When traveling in cold weather, carry emergency supplies and warm clothing in case you become stranded.	general
If you'll be in remote territory, tell others your route and expected return date.	general
Plan to protect yourself.	general
Alcoholic beverages cause your body to lose heat faster.	general
Don't drink alcohol if you plan to be outdoors in cold weather.	general
Doing this even before you go out in the cold will help you stay warm.	general
Eat well-balanced meals and stay hydrated.	general
Exercise can get the blood flowing and help you stay warm, but don't do it to the point of exhaustion.	general
Keep moving.	general
Fuchs dystrophy Fuchs dystrophy With Fuchs' dystrophy, the body of the cornea (stroma) begins to thicken, and the cornea becomes cloudy.	general
Fuchs' dystrophy causes the clear layer (cornea) on the front of your eye to swell.	general
The disorder can lead to glare, cloudy vision and eye discomfort.	general
Fuchs' dystrophy usually affects both eyes and can cause your vision to gradually worsen over years.	general
But most people with Fuchs' dystrophy don't develop symptoms until they reach their 50s or 60s.	general
Some medications and self-care steps may help relieve your Fuchs' dystrophy signs and symptoms.	general
But when the disorder is advanced and you've lost vision, the only way to restore vision is with cornea transplant surgery.	general
As the disease progresses, Fuchs' dystrophy symptoms, which usually affect both eyes, might include: Glare, which can decrease your vision in dim and bright light.	general
Blurred vision, which occurs in the morning after awakening and gradually improves during the day.	general
As the disease progresses, blurred vision either can take longer to improve or doesn't improve.	general
Pain or grittiness from tiny blisters on the surface of your cornea.	general
Other symptoms can include distorted vision, sensitivity to light, difficulty seeing at night and seeing halos around lights.	general
When to see a doctor If you have some of these symptoms, and especially if they worsen over time, see an eye care provider, who might then refer you to a corneal specialist.	general
If symptoms develop suddenly, call for an urgent appointment.	general
Other eye conditions that cause the same symptoms as Fuchs' dystrophy also require prompt treatment.	general
Normally, the cells lining the inside of the cornea (endothelial cells) help maintain a healthy balance of fluids within the cornea and prevent the cornea from swelling.	general
But with Fuchs' dystrophy, the endothelial cells gradually die, resulting in fluid buildup (edema) within the cornea.	general
This causes corneal thickening and blurred vision.	general
Fuchs' dystrophy can be inherited.	general
The genetic basis of the disease is complex ‚Äî family members can be affected to varying degrees or not at all.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing Fuchs' dystrophy include: Fuchs' dystrophy is slightly more common in women than in men.	general
Having a family history of Fuchs' dystrophy increases your risk.	general
Although there's a rare early-onset type of Fuch's dystrophy that begins in childhood, typically the disease starts in the 20s and 30s, with symptoms developing in the 50s and 60s.	general
Smoking and having diabetes might also put you at higher risk of the disease.	general
Functional dyspepsia (dis-PEP-see-uh) is a term for recurring signs and symptoms of indigestion that have no obvious cause.	general
Functional dyspepsia is also called nonulcer stomach pain or nonulcer dyspepsia.	general
Functional dyspepsia is common and can be long lasting.	general
The condition can cause signs and symptoms that resemble those of an ulcer, such as pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen, often accompanied by bloating, belching and nausea.	general
Signs and symptoms of functional dyspepsia may include: A burning sensation or discomfort in your upper abdomen or lower chest, sometimes relieved by food or antacids When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if you experience: Bloody vomit Unexplained weight loss It's not clear what causes functional dyspepsia.	general
Doctors consider it a functional disorder, which means it's not found to be caused by a specific disease or diagnosable disorder.	general
Functional neurologic disorders ‚Äî a newer and broader term that includes what some people call conversion disorder ‚Äî feature nervous system (neurological) symptoms that can't be explained by a neurological disease or other medical condition.	general
However, the symptoms are real and cause significant distress or problems functioning.	general
Signs and symptoms vary, depending on the type of functional neurologic disorder, and may include specific patterns.	general
Typically these disorders affect your movement or your senses, such as the ability to walk, swallow, see or hear.	general
Symptoms can vary in severity and may come and go or be persistent.	general
However, you can't intentionally produce or control your symptoms.	general
The cause of functional neurologic disorders is unknown.	general
The condition may be triggered by a neurological disorder or by a reaction to stress or psychological or physical trauma, but that's not always the case.	general
Functional neurologic disorders are related to how the brain functions, rather than damage to the brain's structure (such as from a stroke, multiple sclerosis, infection or injury).	general
Early diagnosis and treatment, especially education about the condition, can help with recovery.	general
Symptoms of functional neurologic disorders may vary, depending on the type of functional neurologic disorder, and they're significant enough to cause impairment and warrant medical evaluation.	general
Symptoms can affect body movement and function and the senses.	general
"Signs and symptoms that affect body movement and function may include: Weakness or paralysis Loss of balance Difficulty swallowing or feeling ""a lump in the throat"" Seizures or episodes of shaking and apparent loss of consciousness (nonepileptic seizures) Episodes of unresponsiveness Numbness or loss of the touch sensation Speech problems, such as inability to speak or slurred speech Vision problems, such as double vision or blindness Hearing problems or deafness When to see a doctor Seek medical attention for signs and symptoms listed above."	general
If the underlying cause is a neurological disease or another medical condition, quick diagnosis and treatment may be important.	general
If the diagnosis is a functional neurologic disorder, treatment may improve the symptoms and help prevent future problems.	general
The exact cause of functional neurologic disorders is unknown.	general
Theories regarding what happens in the brain to result in symptoms are complex and involve multiple mechanisms that may differ, depending on the type of functional neurologic disorder.	general
Basically, parts of the brain that control the functioning of your muscles and senses may be involved, even though no disease or abnormality exists.	general
Symptoms of functional neurologic disorders may appear suddenly after a stressful event, or with emotional or physical trauma.	general
Other triggers may include changes or disruptions in how the brain functions at the structural, cellular or metabolic level.	general
But the trigger for symptoms can't always be identified.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of functional neurologic disorders include: Having a neurological disease or disorder, such as epilepsy, migraines or a movement disorder Recent significant stress or emotional or physical trauma Having a mental health condition, such as a mood or anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder or certain personality disorders Having a family member with a functional neurologic disorder Possibly, having a history of physical or sexual abuse or neglect in childhood Women may be more likely than men to develop functional neurologic disorders.	general
Complications Some symptoms of functional neurologic disorders, particularly if not treated, can result in substantial disability and poor quality of life, similar to that caused by medical conditions or disease.	general

Nail fungus Nail fungus Nail fungus can cause the nail to become thick or ragged and appear yellow, green, brown or black.	general
An infected nail may separate from the nail bed.	general
Nail fungus is a common condition that begins as a white or yellow spot under the tip of your fingernail or toenail.	general
As the fungal infection goes deeper, nail fungus may cause your nail to discolor, thicken and crumble at the edge.	general
It can affect several nails.	general
If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment.	general
If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help.	general
But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back.	general
Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis).	general
When fungus infects the areas between your toes and the skin of your feet, it's called athlete's foot (tinea pedis).	general
You may have nail fungus if one or more of your nails are: Distorted in shape A dark color, caused by debris building up under your nail Smelling slightly foul Nail fungus can affect fingernails, but it's more common in toenails.	general
When to see a doctor You may want to see a physician if self-care steps haven't helped and the nail becomes increasingly discolored, thickened or deformed.	general
Also see a doctor if you have diabetes and think you're developing nail fungus.	general
Mayo Clinic Minute - Health Precautions You Need to Know About Pedicures Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute - Health Precautions You Need to Know About Pedicures There's nothing like getting pampered with a pedicure.	general
But before you dip your toes in the water, check to be sure the spa is licensed properly.	general
Viven Williams: Oftentimes, those licenses come with the appropriate education, and following the appropriate protocols for how to keep you safe and how to prevent infection.	general
Rachel Miest, M.D. Dermatology Mayo Clinic: Dr. Rachel Miest says bacterial and fungal are the two most common infections.	general
To avoid them, she says, don't be afraid to ask to make sure the spa cleans all equipment between customers.	general
Ms. Williams: Even if all of the appropriate precautions are taken from a cleaning standpoint, bacteria, viruses, fungi ‚îÄ these things are everywhere.	general
To reduce your risk, Dr. Miest says don't shave 24 hours beforehand and don't have your cuticles cut.	general
Ms. Williams: Ask that they only either leave your cuticles alone or gently push them back but not to aggressively push them back or clip them because that cuticle is a very, very important seal.	general
For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams.	general
Ms. Williams: Fungal nail infections are caused by various fungal organisms (fungi).	general
The most common cause is a type of fungus called dermatophyte.	general
Yeast and molds also can cause nail infections.	general
Fungal nail infection can develop in people at any age, but it's more common in older adults.	general
As the nail ages, it can become brittle and dry.	general
The resulting cracks in the nails allow fungi to enter.	general
Other factors ‚Äî such as reduced blood circulation to the feet and a weakened immune system ‚Äî also may play a role.	general
Toenail fungal infection can start from athlete's foot (foot fungus), and it can spread from one nail to another.	general
But it is uncommon to get an infection from someone else.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of developing nail fungus include: Being older, owing to reduced blood flow, more years of exposure to fungi and slower growing nails Sweating heavily Having a history of athlete's foot Walking barefoot in damp communal areas, such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms Having a minor skin or nail injury or a skin condition, such as psoriasis Having diabetes, circulation problems or a weakened immune system Complications A severe case of nail fungus can be painful and may cause permanent damage to your nails.	general
And it may lead to other serious infections that spread beyond your feet if you have a suppressed immune system due to medication, diabetes or other conditions.	general
If you have diabetes, you may have reduced blood circulation and nerve supply in your feet.	general
You're also at greater risk of a bacterial skin infection (cellulitis).	general
So any relatively minor injury to your feet ‚Äî including a nail fungal infection ‚Äî can lead to a more serious complication.	general
See your doctor if you have diabetes and think you're developing nail fungus.	general
The following habits can help prevent nail fungus or reinfections and athlete's foot, which can lead to nail fungus: Wash your hands and feet regularly.	general
Wash your hands after touching an infected nail.	general
Moisturize your nails after washing.	general
Trim nails straight across, smooth the edges with a file and file down thickened areas.	general
Disinfect your nail clippers after each use.	general
Wear sweat-absorbing socks or change your socks throughout the day.	general
Choose shoes made of materials that breathe.	general
Discard old shoes or treat them with disinfectants or antifungal powders.	general
Wear footwear in pool areas and locker rooms.	general
Choose a nail salon that uses sterilized manicure tools for each customer.	general
Give up nail polish and artificial nails.	general
Pectus excavatum Pectus excavatum Pectus excavatum is a condition in which a person's breastbone is sunken into his or her chest.	general
Severe cases of pectus excavatum can eventually interfere with the function of the heart and lungs.	general
Pectus excavatum is a condition in which a person's breastbone is sunken into his or her chest.	general
In severe cases, pectus excavatum can look as if the center of the chest has been scooped out, leaving a deep dent.	general
While the sunken breastbone is often noticeable shortly after birth, the severity of pectus excavatum typically worsens during the adolescent growth spurt.	general
Also called funnel chest, pectus excavatum is more common in boys than in girls.	general
Severe cases of pectus excavatum can eventually interfere with the function of the heart and lungs.	general
But even mild cases of pectus excavatum can make children feel self-conscious about their appearance.	general
Surgery can correct the deformity.	general
For many people with pectus excavatum, their only sign or symptom is a slight indentation in their chests.	general
In some people, the depth of the indentation worsens in early adolescence and can continue to worsen into adulthood.	general
In severe cases of pectus excavatum, the breastbone may compress the lungs and heart.	general
Signs and symptoms may include: Decreased exercise tolerance Recurrent respiratory infections Wheezing or coughing While the exact cause of pectus excavatum is unknown, it may be an inherited condition because it sometimes runs in families.	general
Risk factors Pectus excavatum is more common in boys than in girls.	general
It also occurs more often in people who also have: Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Osteogenesis imperfecta Noonan syndrome Turner syndrome Complications Severe cases of pectus excavatum can compress the heart and lungs or push the heart over to one side.	general
Even mild cases of pectus excavatum can result in self-image problems.	general
Heart and lung problems If the depth of the breastbone indentation is severe, it may reduce the amount of room the lungs have to expand.	general
This compression can also squeeze the heart, pushing it into the left side of the chest and reducing its ability to pump efficiently.	general
Self-image problems Children who have pectus excavatum also tend to have a hunched-forward posture, with flared ribs and shoulder blades.	general
Many are so self-conscious about their appearance that they avoid activities, such as swimming, where the indentation in their chests is more difficult to camouflage with clothing.	general
Galactorrhea (guh-lack-toe-REE-uh) is a milky nipple discharge unrelated to the normal milk production of breast-feeding.	general
Galactorrhea itself isn't a disease, but it could be a sign of an underlying problem.	general
It usually occurs in women, even those who have never had children or after menopause.	general
But galactorrhea can happen in men and even in infants.	general
Excessive breast stimulation, medication side effects or disorders of the pituitary gland all may contribute to galactorrhea.	general
Often, galactorrhea results from increased levels of prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production.	general
Sometimes, the cause of galactorrhea can't be determined.	general
The condition may resolve on its own.	general
Persistent or intermittent milky nipple discharge Nipple discharge involving multiple milk ducts Spontaneously leaked or manually expressed nipple discharge One or both breasts affected Absent or irregular menstrual periods Headaches or vision problems When to see a doctor If you have a persistent, spontaneous milky nipple discharge from one or both of your breasts and you're not pregnant or breast-feeding, make an appointment to see your doctor.	general
If breast stimulation ‚Äî such as excessive nipple manipulation during sexual activity ‚Äî triggers nipple discharge from multiple ducts, you have little cause for worry.	general
The discharge probably doesn't signal anything abnormal, and this discharge often resolves on its own.	general
If you have persistent discharge that doesn't go away, make an appointment with your doctor to get it checked out.	general
Nonmilky nipple discharge ‚Äîparticularly bloody, yellow or clear spontaneous discharge that comes from one duct or is associated with a lump you can feel ‚Äî requires prompt medical attention, as it may be a sign of an underlying breast cancer.	general
Pituitary gland and hypothalamus Pituitary gland and hypothalamus The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are located within the brain and control hormone production.	general
Galactorrhea often results from having too much prolactin ‚Äî the hormone responsible for milk production when you have a baby.	general
Prolactin is produced by your pituitary gland, a small bean-shaped gland at the base of your brain that secretes and regulates several hormones.	general
Possible causes of galactorrhea include: Medications, such as certain sedatives, antidepressants, antipsychotics and high blood pressure drugs Birth control pills A noncancerous pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) or other disorder of the pituitary gland Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) Chronic kidney disease Excessive breast stimulation, which may be associated with sexual activity, frequent breast self-exams with nipple manipulation or prolonged clothing friction Nerve damage to the chest wall from chest surgery, burns or other chest injuries Spinal cord surgery, injury or tumors Idiopathic galactorrhea Sometimes doctors can't find a cause for galactorrhea.	general
This is called idiopathic galactorrhea, and it may just mean that your breast tissue is particularly sensitive to the milk-producing hormone prolactin in your blood.	general
If you have increased sensitivity to prolactin, even normal prolactin levels can lead to galactorrhea.	general
Galactorrhea in men In males, galactorrhea may be associated with testosterone deficiency (male hypogonadism) and usually occurs with breast enlargement or tenderness (gynecomastia).	general
Erectile dysfunction and a lack of sexual desire also are associated with testosterone deficiency.	general
Galactorrhea in newborns Galactorrhea sometimes occurs in newborns.	general
High maternal estrogen levels cross the placenta into the baby's blood.	general
This can cause enlargement of the baby's breast tissue, which may be associated with a milky nipple discharge.	general
This milky discharge is temporary and resolves on its own.	general
If the discharge is persistent, the newborn should be evaluated by a doctor.	general
Gallstones are hardened deposits of bile that can form in your gallbladder.	general
Bile is a digestive fluid produced in your liver and stored in your gallbladder.	general
When you eat, your gallbladder contracts and empties bile into your small intestine (duodenum).	general
Gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in your gallbladder.	general
Your gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of your abdomen, just beneath your liver.	general
The gallbladder holds a digestive fluid called bile that's released into your small intestine.	general
Gallstones range in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball.	general
Some people develop just one gallstone, while others develop many gallstones at the same time.	general
People who experience symptoms from their gallstones usually require gallbladder removal surgery.	general
Gallstones that don't cause any signs and symptoms typically don't need treatment.	general
Products & Services Gallstones may cause no signs or symptoms.	general
If a gallstone lodges in a duct and causes a blockage, the resulting signs and symptoms may include: Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right portion of your abdomen Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the center of your abdomen, just below your breastbone Back pain between your shoulder blades Pain in your right shoulder Nausea or vomiting Gallstone pain may last several minutes to a few hours.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
Seek immediate care if you develop signs and symptoms of a serious gallstone complication, such as: Abdominal pain so intense that you can't sit still or find a comfortable position Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) High fever with chills It's not clear what causes gallstones to form.	general
Doctors think gallstones may result when: Normally, your bile contains enough chemicals to dissolve the cholesterol excreted by your liver.	general
But if your liver excretes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve, the excess cholesterol may form into crystals and eventually into stones.	general
Your bile contains too much cholesterol.	general
Bilirubin is a chemical that's produced when your body breaks down red blood cells.	general
Certain conditions cause your liver to make too much bilirubin, including liver cirrhosis, biliary tract infections and certain blood disorders.	general
The excess bilirubin contributes to gallstone formation.	general
Your bile contains too much bilirubin.	general
If your gallbladder doesn't empty completely or often enough, bile may become very concentrated, contributing to the formation of gallstones.	general
Your gallbladder doesn't empty correctly.	general
Types of gallstones Types of gallstones that can form in the gallbladder include: The most common type of gallstone, called a cholesterol gallstone, often appears yellow in color.	general
These gallstones are composed mainly of undissolved cholesterol, but may contain other components.	general
Cholesterol gallstones.	general
These dark brown or black stones form when your bile contains too much bilirubin.	general
Pigment gallstones.	general
Risk factors Being female Being a Native American Being a Mexican American Being overweight or obese Having diabetes Having certain blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or leukemia Losing weight very quickly Taking medications that contain estrogen, such as oral contraceptives or hormone therapy drugs Having liver disease Complications of gallstones may include: A gallstone that becomes lodged in the neck of the gallbladder can cause inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis).	general
Cholecystitis can cause severe pain and fever.	general
Inflammation of the gallbladder.	general
Gallstones can block the tubes (ducts) through which bile flows from your gallbladder or liver to your small intestine.	general
Severe pain, jaundice and bile duct infection can result.	general
Blockage of the common bile duct.	general
The pancreatic duct is a tube that runs from the pancreas and connects to the common bile duct just before entering the duodenum.	general
Pancreatic juices, which aid in digestion, flow through the pancreatic duct.	general
Blockage of the pancreatic duct.	general
A gallstone can cause a blockage in the pancreatic duct, which can lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).	general
Pancreatitis causes intense, constant abdominal pain and usually requires hospitalization.	general
People with a history of gallstones have an increased risk of gallbladder cancer.	general
But gallbladder cancer is very rare, so even though the risk of cancer is elevated, the likelihood of gallbladder cancer is still very small.	general
Gallbladder cancer.	general
You can reduce your risk of gallstones if you: Try to stick to your usual mealtimes each day.	general
Skipping meals or fasting can increase the risk of gallstones.	general
Don't skip meals.	general
If you need to lose weight, go slow.	general
Rapid weight loss can increase the risk of gallstones.	general
Aim to lose 1 or 2 pounds (about 0.	general
5 to 1 kilogram) a week.	general
Lose weight slowly.	general
Include more fiber-rich foods in your diet, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.	general
Eat more high-fiber foods.	general
Obesity and being overweight increase the risk of gallstones.	general
Work to achieve a healthy weight by reducing the number of calories you eat and increasing the amount of physical activity you get.	general
Once you achieve a healthy weight, work to maintain that weight by continuing your healthy diet and continuing to exercise.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
Gangrene refers to the death of body tissue due to either a lack of blood flow or a serious bacterial infection.	general
Gangrene commonly affects the extremities, including your toes, fingers and limbs, but it can also occur in your muscles and internal organs.	general
Your chances of developing gangrene are higher if you have an underlying condition that can damage your blood vessels and affect blood flow, such as diabetes or hardened arteries (atherosclerosis).	general
Treatments for gangrene include surgery to remove dead tissue, antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.	general
The prognosis for recovery is better if gangrene is identified early and treated quickly.	general
When gangrene affects your skin, signs and symptoms may include: Skin discoloration ‚Äî ranging from pale to blue, purple, black, bronze or red, depending on the type of gangrene you have Swelling or the formation of blisters filled with fluid on the skin A clear line between healthy and damaged skin Sudden, severe pain followed by a feeling of numbness A foul-smelling discharge leaking from a sore Thin, shiny skin, or skin without hair Skin that feels cool or cold to the touch If you have a type of gangrene that affects tissues beneath the surface of your skin, such as gas gangrene or internal gangrene, you may notice that: The affected tissue is swollen and very painful You're running a low-grade fever and generally feel unwell A condition called septic shock can occur if a bacterial infection that originated in the gangrenous tissue spreads throughout your body.	general
Signs and symptoms of septic shock include: Low blood pressure Fever, possibly, though temperature may also run lower than the normal 96.	general
8 F (36 C) Rapid heart rate When to see a doctor Gangrene is a serious condition and needs immediate treatment.	general
Call your doctor right away if you have persistent, unexplained pain in any area of your body along with one or more of the following signs and symptoms: Persistent fever Skin changes ‚Äî including discoloration, warmth, swelling, blisters or lesions ‚Äî that won't go away A foul-smelling discharge leaking from a sore Sudden pain at the site of a recent surgery or trauma Skin that's pale, hard, cold and numb Gangrene of the hand and foot Gangrene of the hand and foot Gangrene results when blood flow to a certain area of your body is interrupted, causing tissue decay and death.	general
Gangrene often affects the fingers or toes.	general
Gangrene may occur due to one or some of the following causes: Your blood provides oxygen, nutrients to feed your cells, and immune system components, such as antibodies, to ward off infections.	general
Without a proper blood supply, cells can't survive, and your tissue decays.	general
Lack of blood supply.	general
If bacteria thrive unchecked for long, infection can take over and cause your tissue to die, causing gangrene.	general
Wounds that are traumatic, such as gunshot wounds or crushing injuries from car crashes, can cause bacteria to invade tissues deep within the body.	general
When such tissues are infected, gangrene can occur.	general
Types of gangrene Dry gangrene is characterized by dry and shriveled skin ranging in color from brown to purplish blue or black.	general
Dry gangrene may develop slowly.	general
It occurs most commonly in people who have arterial blood vessel disease, such as atherosclerosis, or in people who have diabetes.	general
Dry gangrene.	general
"Gangrene is referred to as ""wet"" if there's a bacterial infection in the affected tissue."	general
Swelling, blistering and a wet appearance are common features of wet gangrene.	general
Wet gangrene.	general
It may develop after a severe burn, frostbite or injury.	general
It often occurs in people with diabetes who unknowingly injure a toe or foot.	general
Wet gangrene needs to be treated immediately because it spreads quickly and can be fatal.	general
Gas gangrene typically affects deep muscle tissue.	general
If you have gas gangrene, the surface of your skin may initially appear normal.	general
Gas gangrene.	general
As the condition progresses, your skin may become pale and then evolve to a gray or purplish red color.	general
A bubbly appearance to your skin may become apparent, and the affected skin may make a crackling sound when you press on it because of the gas within the tissue.	general
Gas gangrene is most commonly caused by infection with the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, which develops in an injury or surgical wound that's depleted of blood supply.	general
"The bacterial infection produces toxins that release gas ‚Äî hence the name ""gas"" gangrene ‚Äî and cause tissue death."	general
Like wet gangrene, gas gangrene can be life-threatening.	general
Gangrene that affects one or more of your organs, such as your intestines, gallbladder or appendix, is called internal gangrene.	general
This type of gangrene occurs when blood flow to an internal organ is blocked ‚Äî for example, when your intestines bulge through a weakened area of muscle in your abdomen (hernia) and become twisted.	general
Internal gangrene.	general
Internal gangrene may cause fever and severe pain.	general
Left untreated, internal gangrene can be fatal.	general
Fournier's gangrene involves the genital organs.	general
Men are more often affected, but women can develop this type of gangrene as well.	general
Fournier's gangrene usually arises due to an infection in the genital area or urinary tract and causes genital pain, tenderness, redness and swelling.	general
Fournier's gangrene.	general
This rare type of gangrene typically occurs after an operation, with painful skin lesions developing one to two weeks after surgery.	general
Progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene (Meleney's gangrene).	general
Risk factors Several factors increase your risk of developing gangrene.	general
These include: If you have diabetes, your body doesn't produce enough of the hormone insulin (which helps your cells take up blood sugar) or is resistant to the effects of insulin.	general
High blood sugar levels can eventually damage blood vessels, decreasing or interrupting blood flow to a part of your body.	general
Hardened and narrowed arteries (atherosclerosis) and blood clots also can block blood flow to an area of your body.	general
Blood vessel disease.	general
Any process that causes trauma to your skin and underlying tissue, including an injury or frostbite, increases your risk of developing gangrene, especially if you have an underlying condition that affects blood flow to the injured area.	general
Severe injury or surgery.	general
People who smoke have a higher risk of gangrene.	general
Obesity often accompanies diabetes and vascular disease, but the stress of extra weight alone can also compress arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and increasing your risk of infection and poor wound healing.	general
If you have an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or if you're undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, your body's ability to fight off an infection is impaired.	general
Immunosuppression.	general
In rare instances, certain medications and illegal drugs that are injected have been shown to cause infection with bacteria that cause gangrene.	general
Medications or drugs that are injected.	general
Complications Gangrene can lead to scarring or the need for reconstructive surgery.	general
Sometimes, the amount of tissue death is so extensive that a body part, such as your foot, may need to be removed (amputated).	general
Gangrene that is infected with bacteria can spread quickly to other organs and may be fatal if left untreated.	general
Here are a few suggestions to help you reduce your risk of developing gangrene: If you have diabetes, make sure you examine your hands and feet daily for cuts, sores and signs of infection, such as redness, swelling or drainage.	general
Ask your doctor to examine your hands and feet at least once a year, and try to maintain control over your blood sugar levels.	general
Care for your diabetes.	general
Excess pounds not only put you at risk of diabetes but also place pressure on your arteries, constricting blood flow and putting you at risk of infection and slow wound healing.	general
Lose weight.	general
The chronic use of tobacco products can damage your blood vessels.	general
Don't use tobacco.	general
Wash any open wounds with a mild soap and water and try to keep them clean and dry until they heal.	general
Help prevent infections.	general
Frostbitten skin can lead to gangrene because frostbite reduces blood circulation in an affected area.	general
If you notice that any area of your skin has become pale, hard, cold and numb after prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, call your doctor.	general
Watch out when the temperature drops.	general
Gas in your digestive system is part of the normal process of digestion.	general
Getting rid of excess gas, either by burping or passing gas (flatus), also is normal.	general
Gas pain may occur if gas is trapped or not moving well through your digestive system.	general
An increase in gas or gas pain may result from eating foods that are more likely to produce gas.	general
Often, relatively simple changes in eating habits can lessen bothersome gas.	general
Certain digestive system disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome or celiac disease, may cause ‚Äî in addition to other signs and symptoms ‚Äî an increase in gas or gas pain.	general
Products & Services A feeling of fullness or pressure in your abdomen (bloating) An observable increase in the size of your abdomen (distention) Burping is normal, particularly during or right after a meal.	general
Most people pass gas up to 20 times a day.	general
Therefore, while having gas may be inconvenient or embarrassing, burping and passing gas are rarely by themselves a sign of a medical problem.	general
When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor if your gas or gas pains are so persistent or severe that they interfere with your ability to function well in daily life.	general
Gas or gas pains accompanied by other signs or symptoms may indicate more-serious conditions.	general
See your doctor if you experience any of these additional signs or symptoms: Bloody stools Change in frequency of bowel movements Weight loss Prolonged abdominal pain Gas in your stomach is primarily caused by swallowing air when you eat or drink.	general
Most stomach gas is released when you burp.	general
Gas forms in your large intestine (colon) when bacteria ferment carbohydrates ‚Äî fiber, some starches and some sugars ‚Äî that aren't digested in your small intestine.	general
Bacteria also consume some of that gas, but the remaining gas is released when you pass gas from your anus.	general
High-fiber foods that commonly cause gas include: Beans and peas (legumes) Whole grains While high-fiber foods increase gas production, fiber is essential for keeping your digestive tract in good working order and regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels.	general
Other dietary factors Other dietary factors that can contribute to increased gas in the digestive system include the following: such as soda and beer, increase stomach gas.	general
Carbonated beverages, such as eating too quickly, drinking through a straw, chewing gum, sucking on candies or talking while chewing results in swallowing more air.	general
Eating habits, containing psyllium, such as Metamucil, may increase colon gas.	general
Fiber supplements or artificial sweeteners, such as sorbitol, mannitol and xylitol, found in some sugar-free foods and beverages may cause excess colon gas.	general
Sugar substitutes, Medical conditions Medical conditions that may increase intestinal gas, bloating or gas pain include the following: Excess gas is often a symptom of chronic intestinal conditions, such as diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.	general
Chronic intestinal disease.	general
An increase or change in the bacteria in the small intestine can cause excess gas, diarrhea and weight loss.	general
Small bowel bacterial overgrowth.	general
Gas or bloating may occur if your digestive system can't break down and absorb certain foods, such as the sugar in dairy products (lactose) or proteins such as gluten in wheat and other grains.	general
Food intolerances.	general
Constipation may make it difficult to pass gas.	general
Constipation.	general
Stomach and pyloric valve Stomach and pyloric valve Your stomach is a muscular sac about the size of a small melon that expands when you eat or drink to hold as much as a gallon of food or liquid.	general
Once your stomach pulverizes the food, strong muscular contractions (peristaltic waves) push the food toward the pyloric valve, which leads to the upper portion of your small intestine (duodenum).	general
Gastritis is a general term for a group of conditions with one thing in common: inflammation of the lining of the stomach.	general
The inflammation of gastritis is most often the result of infection with the same bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers.	general
Regular use of certain pain relievers and drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to gastritis.	general
Gastritis may occur suddenly (acute gastritis), or appear slowly over time (chronic gastritis).	general
In some cases, gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer.	general
For most people, however, gastritis isn't serious and improves quickly with treatment.	general
Products & Services The signs and symptoms of gastritis include: Gnawing or burning ache or pain (indigestion) in your upper abdomen that may become either worse or better with eating A feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating Gastritis doesn't always cause signs and symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor Nearly everyone has had a bout of indigestion and stomach irritation.	general
Most cases of indigestion are short-lived and don't require medical care.	general
See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms of gastritis for a week or longer.	general
Tell your doctor if your stomach discomfort occurs after taking prescription or over-the-counter drugs, especially aspirin or other pain relievers.	general
If you are vomiting blood, have blood in your stools or have stools that appear black, see your doctor right away to determine the cause.	general
Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining.	general
Weaknesses or injury to the mucus-lined barrier that protects your stomach wall allows your digestive juices to damage and inflame your stomach lining.	general
A number of diseases and conditions can increase your risk of gastritis, including Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis, a condition in which collections of inflammatory cells grow in the body.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of gastritis include: Although infection with Helicobacter pylori is among the most common worldwide human infections, only some people with the infection develop gastritis or other upper gastrointestinal disorders.	general
Doctors believe vulnerability to the bacterium could be inherited or could be caused by lifestyle choices, such as smoking and diet.	general
Bacterial infection.	general
Common pain relievers ‚Äî such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox) ‚Äî can cause both acute gastritis and chronic gastritis.	general
Using these pain relievers regularly or taking too much of these drugs may reduce a key substance that helps preserve the protective lining of your stomach.	general
Regular use of pain relievers.	general
Older adults have an increased risk of gastritis because the stomach lining tends to thin with age and because older adults are more likely to have H. pylori infection or autoimmune disorders than younger people are.	general
Alcohol can irritate and erode your stomach lining, which makes your stomach more vulnerable to digestive juices.	general
Excessive alcohol use is more likely to cause acute gastritis.	general
Excessive alcohol use.	general
Severe stress due to major surgery, injury, burns or severe infections can cause acute gastritis.	general
Called autoimmune gastritis, this type of gastritis occurs when your body attacks the cells that make up your stomach lining.	general
This reaction can wear away at your stomach's protective barrier.	general
Your own body attacking cells in your stomach.	general
Autoimmune gastritis is more common in people with other autoimmune disorders, including Hashimoto's disease and type 1 diabetes.	general
Autoimmune gastritis can also be associated with vitamin B-12 deficiency.	general
Gastritis may be associated with other medical conditions, including HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease and parasitic infections.	general
Other diseases and conditions.	general
Complications Left untreated, gastritis may lead to stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding.	general
Rarely, some forms of chronic gastritis may increase your risk of stomach cancer, especially if you have extensive thinning of the stomach lining and changes in the lining's cells.	general
Tell your doctor if your signs and symptoms aren't improving despite treatment for gastritis.	general
Preventing H. pylori infection It's not clear how H. pylori spreads, but there's some evidence that it could be transmitted from person to person or through contaminated food and water.	general
You can take steps to protect yourself from infections, such as H. pylori, by frequently washing your hands with soap and water and by eating foods that have been cooked completely.	general
Viral gastroenteritis is an intestinal infection marked by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea or vomiting, and sometimes fever.	general
The most common way to develop viral gastroenteritis ‚Äî often called stomach flu ‚Äîis through contact with an infected person or by ingesting contaminated food or water.	general
If you're otherwise healthy, you'll likely recover without complications.	general
But for infants, older adults and people with compromised immune systems, viral gastroenteritis can be deadly.	general
There's no effective treatment for viral gastroenteritis, so prevention is key.	general
In addition to avoiding food and water that may be contaminated, thorough and frequent hand-washings are your best defense.	general
Viral gastroenteritis Viral gastroenteritis The stomach, small intestine and large intestine (colon) are part of your digestive tract, which processes the foods you eat.	general
Viral gastroenteritis is an inflammation of these organs caused by a virus.	general
Although it's commonly called stomach flu, gastroenteritis isn't the same as influenza.	general
Real flu (influenza) affects only your respiratory system ‚Äî your nose, throat and lungs.	general
Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, attacks your intestines, causing signs and symptoms, such as: Watery, usually nonbloody diarrhea ‚Äî bloody diarrhea usually means you have a different, more severe infection Abdominal cramps and pain Nausea, vomiting or both Low-grade fever Depending on the cause, viral gastroenteritis symptoms may appear within one to three days after you're infected and can range from mild to severe.	general
Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they may persist as long as 10 days.	general
Because the symptoms are similar, it's easy to confuse viral diarrhea with diarrhea caused by bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile, salmonella and E. coli, or parasites, such as giardia.	general
When to see a doctor If you're an adult, call your doctor if: You're not able to keep liquids down for 24 hours You've been vomiting for more than two days You're vomiting blood You're dehydrated ‚Äî signs of dehydration include excessive thirst, dry mouth, deep yellow urine or little or no urine, and severe weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness You notice blood in your bowel movements You have a fever above 104 F (40 C) For infants and children Has a fever of 102 F (38.	general
9 C) or higher Seems lethargic or very irritable Is in a lot of discomfort or pain Has bloody diarrhea Seems dehydrated ‚Äî watch for signs of dehydration in sick infants and children by comparing how much they drink and urinate with how much is normal for them If you have an infant, remember that while spitting up may be an everyday occurrence for your baby, vomiting is not.	general
Babies vomit for a variety of reasons, many of which may require medical attention.	general
Call your baby's doctor right away if your baby: Has vomiting that lasts more than several hours Hasn't had a wet diaper in six hours Has bloody stools or severe diarrhea Has a sunken soft spot (fontanel)on the top of his or her head Has a dry mouth or cries without tears You're most likely to contract viral gastroenteritis when you eat or drink contaminated food or water, or if you share utensils, towels or food with someone who's infected.	general
A number of viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including: Both children and adults are affected by noroviruses, the most common cause of foodborne illness worldwide.	general
Norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities.	general
It's especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces.	general
In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water, although person-to-person transmission also is possible.	general
Noroviruses.	general
Worldwide, this is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, who are usually infected when they put their fingers or other objects contaminated with the virus into their mouths.	general
The infection is most severe in infants and young children.	general
Adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms, but can still spread the illness ‚Äî of particular concern in institutional settings because infected adults unknowingly can pass the virus to others.	general
A vaccine against viral gastroenteritis is available in some countries, including the United States, and appears to be effective in preventing the infection.	general
Some shellfish, especially raw or undercooked oysters, also can make you sick.	general
Although contaminated drinking water is a cause of viral diarrhea, in many cases the virus is passed through the fecal-oral route ‚Äî that is, someone with a virus handles food you eat without washing his or her hands after using the toilet.	general
Risk factors Gastroenteritis occurs all over the world, affecting people of every age, race and background.	general
People who may be more susceptible to gastroenteritis include: Children in child care centers or elementary schools may be especially vulnerable because it takes time for a child's immune system to mature.	general
Young children.	general
Adult immune systems tend to become less efficient later in life.	general
Older adults in nursing homes, in particular, are vulnerable because their immune systems weaken and they live in close contact with others who may pass along germs.	general
Older adults.	general
Anywhere that groups of people come together in close quarters can be an environment for an intestinal infection to get passed.	general
Schoolchildren, churchgoers or dormitory residents.	general
If your resistance to infection is low ‚Äî for instance, if your immune system is compromised by HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy or another medical condition ‚Äî you may be especially at risk.	general
Anyone with a weakened immune system.	general
Each gastrointestinal virus has a season when it's most active.	general
If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, for instance, you're more likely to have rotavirus or norovirus infections between October and April.	general
Complications The main complication of viral gastroenteritis is dehydration ‚Äî a severe loss of water and essential salts and minerals.	general
If you're healthy and drink enough to replace fluids you lose from vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration shouldn't be a problem.	general
Infants, older adults and people with suppressed immune systems may become severely dehydrated when they lose more fluids than they can replace.	general
Hospitalization might be needed so that lost fluids can be replaced intravenously.	general
Dehydration can be fatal, but rarely.	general
The best way to prevent the spread of intestinal infections is to follow these precautions: A vaccine against gastroenteritis caused by the rotavirus is available in some countries, including the United States.	general
Given to children in the first year of life, the vaccine appears to be effective in preventing severe symptoms of this illness.	general
Get your child vaccinated.	general
And make sure your children do, too.	general
If your children are older, teach them to wash their hands, especially after using the toilet.	general
It's best to use warm water and soap and to rub hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds, remembering to wash around cuticles, beneath fingernails and in the creases of the hands.	general
Then rinse thoroughly.	general
Carry sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer for times when soap and water aren't available.	general
Wash your hands thoroughly.	general
Avoid sharing eating utensils, drinking glasses and plates.	general
Use separate towels in the bathroom.	general
Use separate personal items around your home.	general
Avoid close contact with anyone who has the virus, if possible.	general
Keep your distance.	general
If someone in your home has viral gastroenteritis, disinfect hard surfaces, such as counters, faucets and doorknobs, with a mixture of 2 cups (0.	general
47 liters) of bleach to 1 gallon (3.	general
8 liters) of water.	general
Disinfect hard surfaces.	general
Make sure the center has separate rooms for changing diapers and preparing or serving food.	general
The room with the diaper-changing table should have a sink as well as a sanitary way to dispose of diapers.	general
Check out your child care center.	general
Take precautions when traveling When you're traveling in other countries, you can become sick from contaminated food or water.	general
You may be able to reduce your risk by following these tips: Drink only well-sealed bottled or carbonated water.	general
Avoid ice cubes, because they may be made from contaminated water.	general
Use bottled water to brush your teeth.	general
Avoid raw food ‚Äî including peeled fruits, raw vegetables and salads ‚Äî that has been touched by human hands.	general
Avoid undercooked meat and fish.	general
Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a symptom of a disorder in your digestive tract.	general
The blood often appears in stool or vomit but isn't always visible, though it may cause the stool to look black or tarry.	general
The level of bleeding can range from mild to severe and can be life-threatening.	general
Sophisticated imaging technology, when needed, can usually locate the cause of the bleeding.	general
Treatment depends on the source of the bleeding.	general
Signs and symptoms of GI bleeding can be either obvious (overt) or hidden (occult).	general
Signs and symptoms depend on the location of the bleed, which can be anywhere on the GI tract, from where it starts ‚Äî the mouth ‚Äî to where it ends ‚Äî the anus ‚Äî and the rate of bleeding.	general
Overt bleeding might show up as: Vomiting blood, which might be red or might be dark brown and resemble coffee grounds in texture Black, tarry stool With occult bleeding, you might have: Lightheadedness Symptoms of shock If your bleeding starts abruptly and progresses rapidly, you could go into shock.	general
Signs and symptoms of shock include: Drop in blood pressure Rapid pulse When to see a doctor If you have symptoms of shock, you or someone else should call 911 or your local emergency medical number.	general
If you're vomiting blood, see blood in your stools or have black, tarry stools, seek immediate medical care.	general
For other indications of GI bleeding, make an appointment with your doctor.	general
Esophageal varices Esophageal varices Esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus.	general
They're often due to obstructed blood flow through the portal vein, which carries blood from the intestine, pancreas and spleen to the liver.	general
Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in your lower rectum.	general
Internal hemorrhoids are usually painless, but tend to bleed.	general
External hemorrhoids may cause pain.	general
Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur either in the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract.	general
It can have a number of causes.	general
Upper GI bleeding Causes can include: This is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding.	general
Peptic ulcers are sores that develop on the lining of the stomach and upper portion of the small intestine.	general
Stomach acid, either from bacteria or use of anti-inflammatory drugs, damages the lining, leading to formation of sores.	general
Peptic ulcer.	general
Known as Mallory-Weiss tears, they can cause a lot of bleeding.	general
These are most common in people who drink alcohol to excess.	general
Tears in the lining of the tube that connects your throat to your stomach (esophagus).	general
This condition occurs most often in people with serious liver disease.	general
Abnormal, enlarged veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices).	general
This inflammation of the esophagus is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).	general
Esophagitis.	general
Lower GI bleeding Causes can include: This involves the development of small, bulging pouches in the digestive tract (diverticulosis).	general
If one or more of the pouches become inflamed or infected, it's called diverticulitis.	general
Diverticular disease.	general
This includes ulcerative colitis, which causes inflammation and sores in the colon and rectum, and Crohn's disease, and inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract.	general
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).	general
Noncanerous (benign) or cancerous tumors of the esophagus, stomach, colon or rectum can weaken the lining of the digestive tract and cause bleeding.	general
Small clumps of cells that form on the lining of your colon can cause bleeding.	general
Most are harmless, but some might be cancerous or can become cancerous if not removed.	general
Colon polyps.	general
These are swollen veins in your anus or lower rectum, similar to varicose veins.	general
Hemorrhoids.	general
These are small tears in the lining of the anus.	general
Anal fissures.	general
Inflammation of the lining of the rectum can cause rectal bleeding.	general
Complications Limit your use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	general
Limit your use of alcohol.	general
If you smoke, quit.	general
If you have GERD, follow your doctor's instructions for treating it.	general
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that can be located in any part of the digestive system.	general
Their most common sites are the stomach and small intestine.	general
s start in specialized nerve cells located in the walls of your digestive system.	general
These cells are part of the autonomic nervous system.	general
A specific change in the DNA of one of these cells, which control such digestive processes as movement of food through the intestines, gives rise to a .	general
Small s may cause no symptoms, and they may grow so slowly that they have no serious effects.	general
People with larger s usually seek medical attention when they vomit blood or pass blood in their stool due to rapid bleeding from the tumor.	general
Other possible symptoms include: Anemia, caused by a slow-bleeding tumor Abdominal pain Weight loss Difficulty swallowing s can develop in people of all ages, but they are most common between age 50 and 70, and they almost never occur before age 40.	general
In rare cases, an inherited genetic change (mutation) causes s. After asking questions about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor will examine you carefully, checking for a growth in your abdomen.	general
If signs and symptoms suggest that you may have a , tests to locate it and then determine its likelihood of spreading (metastasizing) to other organs will follow.	general
These tests may include: For this test, you swallow a liquid that makes your stomach and small intestine more visible on X-rays.	general
You may also receive an injection of a similar substance.	general
Then the scanner takes numerous X-rays as it moves over your abdomen.	general
A computer combines the X-rays into detailed, cross-sectional images of your abdominal organs, showing the size and position of the tumor.	general
Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan.	general
The doctor examines the inner lining of the esophagus, stomach and the first part of the small intestine with a flexible, lighted tube (endoscope) passed down through your mouth.	general
It may be possible to take small samples of abnormal tissue during an upper endoscopy.	general
During this test, you'll receive a mild relaxing medication (sedative) through an intravenous line.	general
Upper endoscopy.	general
This test also uses an endoscope, but with an ultrasound probe on the tip of the scope.	general
As sound waves from the probe create echoes that bounce back to the probe, a computer translates the echoes into an image of the structures in the abdomen, showing the precise location of the tumor.	general
If the tumor has metastasized to your liver or the lining of your abdomen, these areas may also be visible.	general
An also helps determine the depth of the tumor within the wall of the stomach or other locations in the gastrointestinal tract.	general
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).	general
A small sample of tissue from the tumor is necessary for a definite diagnosis.	general
The preferred method for taking a biopsy sample is endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration.	general
This procedure is the same as an , but with a thin, hollow needle on the tip of the endoscope.	general
The needle is used to remove small amounts of tissue for laboratory analysis.	general
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy.	general
Sometimes these tests aren't possible, or their results are inconclusive, so a suspected can't be located without surgery.	general
Tissue analysis then takes place after the tumor is removed.	general
These tests provide information on the proteins tumor cells make.	general
One of these tests, immunohistochemistry, detects specific proteins controlled by genes in cells.	general
Identification of these proteins helps guide treatment decisions.	general
Sometimes, actual genetic testing of biopsy samples is necessary to locate genes in tumor DNA.	general
cells are also examined under a microscope to see how many cells out of 50 different microscopic fields are actively dividing.	general
This number is known as the mitotic rate.	general
The higher the mitotic rate in a tumor, the more aggressive it is, and the greater is its likelihood of spreading to other organs.	general
Laboratory tests on biopsies.	general
Small, asymptomatic s found in the course of tests for another condition may be approached with watchful waiting in carefully selected cases.	general
Usually, large or symptomatic s are surgically removed unless they are too large or they involve too many organs and tissues for surgery.	general
Resection is also delayed or avoided in people whose general health makes any surgery too risky to undertake, as well as in those likely to have metastatic s. It's often possible to resect s using minimally invasive surgery, which involves inserting a viewing tube (laparoscope) and surgical instruments through small incisions in the abdomen.	general
Targeted drug therapy Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells.	general
By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die.	general
For s, the target of these drugs is an enzyme called tyrosine kinase that helps cancer cells grow.	general
Imatinib (Gleevec) is the first line targeted therapy used to prevent recurrence after surgery.	general
The drug is also used to shrink the tumor before surgery, in situations where surgery isn't possible, as well as for controlling recurrent .	general
Treatment generally continues as long as the drug is effective.	general
Other drugs that target tyrosine kinase might be recommended if your doesn't respond to or becomes resistant to imatinib over time.	general
Targeted drug therapy is an active area of cancer research and new medications are likely to be available in the future.	general
Gaucher (go-SHAY) disease is the result of a buildup of certain fatty substances in certain organs, particularly your spleen and liver.	general
This causes these organs to enlarge and can affect their function.	general
The fatty substances also can build up in bone tissue, weakening the bone and increasing the risk of fractures.	general
If the bone marrow is affected, it can interfere with your blood's ability to clot.	general
An enzyme that breaks down these fatty substances doesn't work properly in people with Gaucher disease.	general
Treatment often includes enzyme replacement therapy.	general
An inherited disorder, Gaucher disease is most common in Jewish people of Eastern and Central European descent (Ashkenazi).	general
Symptoms can appear at any age.	general
There are different types of Gaucher disease, and signs and symptoms of disease vary widely, even within the same type.	general
Type 1 is by far the most common.	general
Siblings, even identical twins, with the disease can have different levels of severity.	general
Some people who have Gaucher disease have only mild or no symptoms.	general
Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems: Because the liver and especially the spleen can enlarge dramatically, the abdomen can become painfully distended.	general
Abdominal complaints.	general
Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures.	general
It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die.	general
Skeletal abnormalities.	general
A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue.	general
Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds.	general
Blood disorders.	general
More rarely, Gaucher disease affects the brain, which can cause abnormal eye movements, muscle rigidity, swallowing difficulties and seizures.	general
One rare subtype of Gaucher disease begins in infancy and typically results in death by 2 years of age.	general
When to see a doctor If you or your child has the signs and symptoms associated with Gaucher disease, make an appointment with your doctor.	general
Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern To have an autosomal recessive disorder, you inherit two mutated genes, one from each parent.	general
These disorders are usually passed on by two carriers.	general
Their health is rarely affected, but they have one mutated gene (recessive gene) and one normal gene (dominant gene) for the condition.	general
Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes (left), a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier (middle) and a 25% chance of having an affected child with two recessive genes (right).	general
Gaucher disease is passed along in an inheritance pattern called autosomal recessive.	general
Both parents must be carriers of a Gaucher changed (mutated) gene for their child to inherit the condition.	general
Risk factors People of Eastern and Central European Jewish (Ashkenazi) ancestry are at higher risk of developing the most common variety of Gaucher disease.	general
Gender dysphoria is the feeling of discomfort or distress that might occur in people whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth or sex-related physical characteristics.	general
Transgender and gender-nonconforming people might experience gender dysphoria at some point in their lives.	general
But not everyone is affected.	general
Some transgender and gender-nonconforming people feel at ease with their bodies, either with or without medical intervention.	general
Gender dysphoria is a diagnosis listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association to diagnose mental conditions.	general
This term is intended to be more descriptive than the one that was previously used, gender identity disorder.	general
The term gender dysphoria focuses on one's discomfort as the problem, rather than identity.	general
A diagnosis for gender dysphoria was created to help people get access to necessary health care and effective treatment.	general
Gender dysphoria might cause adolescents and adults to experience: A marked difference between your inner gender identity and assigned gender lasting at least six months, as shown by at least two of the following: A marked difference between your inner gender identity and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics, or anticipated secondary sex characteristics in young adolescents A strong desire to be rid of primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked difference with your inner gender identity, or a desire to prevent the development of anticipated secondary sex characteristics in young adolescents A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender A strong desire to be of the other gender or an alternate gender different from assigned gender A strong desire to be treated as the other gender or an alternate gender different from assigned gender A strong conviction that you have typical feelings and reactions of the other gender or an alternate gender different from assigned gender Significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other areas of functioning Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood (early onset).	general
Or, you might have periods in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria followed by a recurrence of gender dysphoria.	general
You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life (late onset).	general
Complications Gender dysphoria can impair many aspects of life.	general
Preoccupation with being of another gender than the one assigned often interferes with daily activities.	general
People experiencing gender dysphoria might refuse to go to school, due to pressure to dress in a way that's associated with their sex or out of fear of being harassed or teased.	general
Gender dysphoria can also impair the ability to function at school or at work, resulting in school dropout or unemployment.	general
Relationship difficulties are common.	general
Anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders, substance abuse and other problems can occur.	general
People who have gender dysphoria also often experience discrimination, resulting in minority stress.	general
Access to health services and mental health services can be difficult, due to fear of stigma and a lack of experienced providers.	general
Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria before gender reassignment might be at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide.	general
After gender reassignment, suicide risk might continue.	general
Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).	general
Sexual contact is the primary way that the virus spreads.	general
After the initial infection, the virus lies dormant in your body and can reactivate several times a year.	general
Genital herpes can cause pain, itching and sores in your genital area.	general
But you may have no signs or symptoms of genital herpes.	general
If infected, you can be contagious even if you have no visible sores.	general
There's no cure for genital herpes, but medications can ease symptoms and reduce the risk of infecting others.	general
Condoms also can help prevent the spread of a genital herpes infection.	general
Genital herpes Genital herpes Sores associated with genital herpes can be small red bumps, blisters or open sores.	general
Scabs eventually form and the sores heal, but they tend to recur.	general
Most people infected with HSV don't know they have it because they don't have any signs or symptoms or because their signs and symptoms are so mild.	general
When present, symptoms may begin about two to 12 days after exposure to the virus.	general
If you experience symptoms of genital herpes, they may include: You may experience pain and tenderness in your genital area until the infection clears.	general
Pain or itching.	general
These may appear a few days to a few weeks after infection.	general
Small red bumps or tiny white blisters.	general
These may form when blisters rupture and ooze or bleed.	general
Ulcers may make it painful to urinate.	general
Skin will crust over and form scabs as ulcers heal.	general
During an initial outbreak, you may have flu-like signs and symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes in your groin, headache, muscle aches and fever.	general
Differences in symptom location Sores appear where the infection entered your body.	general
You can spread the infection by touching a sore and then rubbing or scratching another area of your body, including your eyes.	general
Men and women can develop sores on the: Buttocks and thighs Urethra (the tube that allows urine to drain from the bladder to the outside) Women can also develop sores in or on the: Vaginal area External genitals Recurrences are common Genital herpes is different for each person.	general
The signs and symptoms may recur, off and on, for years.	general
Some people experience numerous episodes each year.	general
For many people, however, the outbreaks are less frequent as time passes.	general
During a recurrence, shortly before sores appear, you may feel: Burning, tingling and itching where the infection first entered your body Pain in your lower back, buttocks and legs However, recurrences are generally less painful than the original outbreak, and sores generally heal more quickly.	general
When to see a doctor If you suspect you have genital herpes ‚Äî or any other sexually transmitted infection ‚Äî see your doctor.	general
Two types of herpes simplex virus infections can cause genital herpes: This is the type that usually causes cold sores or fever blisters around your mouth.	general
HSV-1 is often spread through skin-to-skin contact, though it can be spread to your genital area during oral sex.	general
Recurrences are much less frequent than they are with HSV-2 infection.	general
This is the type that commonly causes genital herpes.	general
The virus spreads through sexual contact and skin-to-skin contact.	general
HSV-2 is very common and highly contagious, whether or not you have an open sore.	general
Because the virus dies quickly outside of the body, it's nearly impossible to get the infection through contact with toilets, towels or other objects used by an infected person.	general
More Information Risk factors Your risk of becoming infected with genital herpes may increase if you: Women are more likely to have genital herpes than are men.	general
The virus is sexually transmitted more easily from men to women than it is from women to men.	general
Are a woman.	general
Each additional sexual partner raises your risk of being exposed to the virus that causes genital herpes.	general
Have multiple sexual partners.	general
Complications Having genital sores increases your risk of transmitting or contracting other sexually transmitted infections, including AIDS.	general
Other sexually transmitted infections.	general
Babies born to infected mothers can be exposed to the virus during the birthing process.	general
This may result in brain damage, blindness or death for the newborn.	general
Newborn infection.	general
In some cases, the sores associated with genital herpes can cause inflammation around the tube that delivers urine from your bladder to the outside world (urethra).	general
The swelling can close the urethra for several days, requiring the insertion of a catheter to drain your bladder.	general
Bladder problems.	general
In rare instances, HSV infection leads to inflammation of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord.	general
Meningitis.	general
Genital herpes can lead to inflammation of the lining of the rectum, particularly in men who have sex with men.	general
Rectal inflammation (proctitis).	general
The suggestions for preventing genital herpes are the same as those for preventing other sexually transmitted infections: Abstain from sexual activity or limit sexual contact to only one person who is infection-free.	general
Short of that, you can: Use, or have your partner use, a latex condom during every sexual contact Avoid intercourse if either partner has an outbreak of herpes in the genital area or anywhere else Pregnancy precautions If you're pregnant and know you have genital herpes, tell your doctor.	general
If you think you might have genital herpes, ask to be tested for it.	general
Your doctor may recommend that you start taking herpes antiviral medications late in pregnancy to try to prevent an outbreak around the time of delivery.	general
If you're having an outbreak when you go into labor, your doctor will probably suggest a cesarean section to reduce the risk of passing the virus to your baby.	general
Germ cell tumors are growths that form from reproductive cells.	general
Tumors may be cancerous or noncancerous.	general
Most germ cell tumors that are cancerous occur as cancer of the testicles (testicular cancer) or cancer of the ovaries (ovarian cancer).	general
Some germ cell tumors occur in other areas of the body, such as the abdomen, brain and chest, though it's not clear why.	general
Germ cell tumors that occur in places other than the testicles and ovaries (extragonadal germ cell tumors) are very rare.	general
Germ cell tumors tend to respond to treatment and many can be cured, even when diagnosed at a late stage.	general
Clinical trials testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.	general
Rubella results in a fine, pink rash that appears on the face, the trunk (shown in image), and then the arms and legs.	general
Rubella, also called German measles or three-day measles, is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash.	general
Rubella is not the same as measles (rubeola), though the two illnesses do share some characteristics, including the red rash.	general
However, rubella is caused by a different virus than measles, and is neither as infectious nor usually as severe as measles.	general
The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, usually given to children in the United States twice before they reach school age, is highly effective in preventing rubella.	general
Because of widespread use of the vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has declared rubella eliminated in the United States, but cautions parents to make sure their children are vaccinated to prevent its re-emergence.	general
Products & Services The signs and symptoms of rubella are often so mild they're difficult to notice, especially in children.	general
If signs and symptoms do occur, they generally appear between two and three weeks after exposure to the virus.	general
They typically last about one to five days and may include: Mild fever of 102 F (38.	general
9 C) or lower Inflamed, red eyes Enlarged, tender lymph nodes at the base of the skull, the back of the neck and behind the ears A fine, pink rash that begins on the face and quickly spreads to the trunk and then the arms and legs, before disappearing in the same sequence Aching joints, especially in young women When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if you think you or your child may have been exposed to rubella or if you have the signs or symptoms listed above.	general
If you're contemplating getting pregnant, check your vaccination record to make sure you've received your MMR inoculations.	general
If you're pregnant and you contract rubella, especially during your first trimester, the virus can cause death or serious birth defects in the developing fetus.	general
Rubella during pregnancy is the most common cause of congenital deafness.	general
It's best to be protected against rubella before pregnancy.	general
If you're pregnant, you'll likely undergo a routine screening for immunity to rubella.	general
But if you've never received the vaccine and you think you might have been exposed to rubella, contact your doctor immediately.	general
A blood test might confirm that you're already immune.	general
The cause of rubella is a virus that's passed from person to person.	general
It can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or it can spread by direct contact with an infected person's respiratory secretions, such as mucus.	general
It can also be transmitted from pregnant women to their unborn children via the bloodstream.	general
A person with rubella is contagious for one to two weeks before the onset of the rash until about one or two weeks after the rash disappears.	general
An infected person can spread the illness before the person realizes he or she has it.	general
Rubella is rare in the United States because most children receive a vaccination against the infection at an early age.	general
However, cases of rubella do occur, mostly in unvaccinated foreign-born adults.	general
The disease is still common in many parts of the world.	general
The prevalence of rubella in other countries is something to consider before going abroad, especially if you're pregnant.	general
Complications Rubella is a mild infection.	general
Once you've had the disease, you're usually permanently immune.	general
Some women with rubella experience arthritis in the fingers, wrists and knees, which generally lasts for about one month.	general
In rare cases, rubella can cause an ear infection (otitis media) or inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).	general
However, if you're pregnant when you contract rubella, the consequences for your unborn child may be severe, and in some cases, fatal.	general
Up to 80 percent of infants born to mothers who had rubella during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy develop congenital rubella syndrome.	general
This syndrome can cause one or more problems, including: Growth retardation Intellectual disabilities The highest risk to the fetus is during the first trimester, but exposure later in pregnancy also is dangerous.	general
The rubella vaccine is usually given as a combined measles-mumps-rubella inoculation, which contains the safest and most effective form of each vaccine.	general
Doctors recommend that children receive the MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, and again between 4 and 6 years of age ‚Äî before entering school.	general
It's particularly important that girls receive the vaccine to prevent rubella during future pregnancies.	general
Usually babies are protected from rubella for six to eight months after birth because of the immunity passed on from their mothers.	general
If a child requires protection from rubella before 12 months of age ‚Äî for example, for certain foreign travel ‚Äî the vaccine can be given as early as 6 months of age.	general
But children who are vaccinated early still need to be vaccinated at the recommended ages later.	general
Do you need the MMR vaccine?	general
You need a vaccine if you: Had two doses of the MMR vaccine after 12 months of age Have blood tests that indicate you're immune to measles, mumps and rubella Are a man who was born before 1957 Are a woman who was born before 1957, you already had the rubella vaccine, or you have a positive rubella immunity test You typically should get a vaccine if you fit the criteria listed above you: Are a nonpregnant woman of childbearing age Attend college, trade school or postsecondary school Work in a hospital, medical facility, child care center or school Plan to travel overseas or take a cruise The vaccine is recommended for: Pregnant women or women who plan to get pregnant within the next four weeks People who have had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin or a previous dose of MMR vaccine If you have cancer, a blood disorder or another disease, or you take medication that affects your immune system, talk to your doctor before getting an MMR vaccine.	general
Side effects of the vaccine Most people experience no side effects from the vaccine.	general
About 15 percent of people develop a fever between seven and 12 days after the vaccination, and about 5 percent of people develop a mild rash.	general
Some teens and adult women experience temporary joint pain or stiffness after receiving the vaccine.	general
Fewer than 1 out of 1 million doses causes a serious allergic reaction.	general
In recent years, as the number of children diagnosed with autism has risen ‚Äî without a clear explanation ‚Äî widespread concerns have been raised about a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism.	general
However, extensive reports from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academy of Medicine and the CDC conclude that there is no scientifically proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism.	general
In addition, there is no scientific benefit to separating the vaccines.	general
These organizations note that autism is often identified in toddlers between the ages of 18 and 30 months, which happens to be about the time children are given their first MMR vaccine.	general
But this coincidence in timing typically shouldn't be mistaken for a cause-and-effect relationship.	general
Giardia infection is an intestinal infection marked by abdominal cramps, bloating, nausea and bouts of watery diarrhea.	general
Giardia infection is caused by a microscopic parasite that is found worldwide, especially in areas with poor sanitation and unsafe water.	general
Giardia infection (giardiasis) is one of the most common causes of waterborne disease in the United States.	general
The parasites are found in backcountry streams and lakes but also in municipal water supplies, swimming pools, whirlpool spas and wells.	general
Giardia infection can be transmitted through food and person-to-person contact.	general
Giardia infections usually clear up within a few weeks.	general
But you may have intestinal problems long after the parasites are gone.	general
Several drugs are generally effective against giardia parasites, but not everyone responds to them.	general
Prevention is your best defense.	general
Some people with giardia infection never develop signs or symptoms but still carry the parasite and can spread it to others through their stool.	general
For those who do get sick, signs and symptoms usually appear one to three weeks after exposure and may include: Watery, sometimes foul-smelling diarrhea that may alternate with soft, greasy stools Fatigue or malaise Weight loss Signs and symptoms of giardia infection may last two to six weeks, but in some people they last longer or recur.	general
When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you have loose stools, abdominal bloating and nausea lasting more than a week, or if you become dehydrated.	general
Be sure to tell your doctor if you're at risk of giardia infection ‚Äî that is, you have a child in child care, you've recently traveled to an endemic area, or you've swallowed water from a lake or stream.	general
Giardia parasites live in the intestines of people and animals.	general
Before the microscopic parasites are passed in stool, they become encased within hard shells called cysts, which allows them to survive outside the intestines for months.	general
Once inside a host, the cysts dissolve and the parasites are released.	general
Infection occurs when you accidentally ingest the parasite cysts.	general
This can occur by swallowing contaminated water, by eating contaminated food or through person-to-person contact.	general
Swallowing contaminated water The most common way to become infected with giardia is after swallowing contaminated water.	general
Giardia parasites are found in lakes, ponds, rivers and streams worldwide, as well as in municipal water supplies, wells, cisterns, swimming pools, water parks and spas.	general
Ground and surface water can become contaminated from agricultural runoff, wastewater discharge or animal feces.	general
Children in diapers and people with diarrhea may accidentally contaminate pools and spas.	general
Eating contaminated food Giardia parasites can be transmitted through food ‚Äî either because food handlers with giardiasis don't wash their hands thoroughly or because raw produce is irrigated or washed with contaminated water.	general
Because cooking food kills giardia, food is a less common source of infection than water is, especially in industrialized countries.	general
Person-to-person contact You can contract giardiasis if your hands become contaminated with fecal matter ‚Äî parents changing a child's diapers are especially at risk.	general
So are child care workers and children in child care centers, where outbreaks are increasingly common.	general
The giardia parasite can also spread through anal sex.	general
Risk factors The giardia parasite is a very common intestinal parasite.	general
Although anyone can pick up giardia parasites, some people are especially at risk: Giardia infection is far more common in children than it is in adults.	general
Children are more likely to come in contact with feces, especially if they wear diapers, are toilet training or spend time in a child care center.	general
People who live or work with small children also are at higher risk of developing giardia infection.	general
Giardiasis is rampant wherever sanitation is inadequate or water isn't safe to drink.	general
You're at risk if you travel to places where giardiasis is common, especially if you aren't careful about what you eat and drink.	general
The risk is greatest in rural or wilderness areas.	general
People without access to safe drinking water.	general
Having anal sex without using a condom puts you at increased risk of giardia infection, as well as sexually transmitted infections.	general
People who have anal sex.	general
Complications Giardia infection is almost never fatal in industrialized countries, but it can cause lingering symptoms and serious complications, especially in infants and children.	general
The most common complications include: Often a result of severe diarrhea, dehydration occurs when the body doesn't have enough water to carry out its normal functions.	general
Dehydration.	general
Chronic diarrhea from giardia infection can lead to malnutrition and harm children's physical and mental development.	general
Failure to thrive.	general
Many people with giardia infection develop lactose intolerance ‚Äî the inability to properly digest milk sugar.	general
The problem may persist long after the infection has cleared.	general
Lactose intolerance.	general
No drug or vaccine can prevent giardia infection.	general
But commonsense precautions can go a long way toward reducing the chances that you'll become infected or spread the infection to others.	general
This is the simplest and best way to prevent most kinds of infection.	general
Wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers and before eating or preparing food.	general
When soap and water aren't available, alcohol-based sanitizers are an option.	general
However, alcohol-based sanitizers are not effective in destroying the cyst form of giardia that survives in the environment.	general
Wash your hands.	general
Avoid drinking untreated water from shallow wells, lakes, rivers, springs, ponds and streams unless you filter it or boil it for at least 10 minutes at 158 F (70 C) first.	general
Purify wilderness water.	general
Try not to swallow water when swimming in pools, lakes or streams.	general
Keep your mouth closed.	general
When traveling to parts of the world where the water supply is likely to be unsafe, drink and brush your teeth with bottled water that you open yourself.	general
Don't use ice, and avoid raw fruits and vegetables, even those you peel yourself.	general
Use bottled water.	general
If you engage in anal sex, use a condom every time.	general
Avoid oral-anal sex unless you're fully protected.	general
Practice safer sex.	general
The liver is your largest internal organ.	general
About the size of a football, it's located mainly in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and above your stomach.	general
Gilbert's (zheel-BAYRS) syndrome is a common, harmless liver condition in which the liver doesn't properly process bilirubin.	general
Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of red blood cells.	general
If you have Gilbert's syndrome ‚Äî also known as constitutional hepatic dysfunction and familial nonhemolytic jaundice ‚Äî you're born with the condition as a result of an inherited gene mutation.	general
You might not know you have Gilbert's syndrome until it's discovered by accident, such as when a blood test shows elevated bilirubin levels.	general
Gilbert's syndrome requires no treatment.	general
The most frequent sign of Gilbert's syndrome is an occasional yellowish tinge of the skin and the whites of the eyes as a result of the slightly elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood.	general
In people with Gilbert's syndrome, bilirubin levels may increase and jaundice may become apparent because of: Illness, such as a cold or the flu Fasting or eating a very low-calorie diet Dehydration Menstruation When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have jaundice, which has many possible causes.	general
An abnormal gene you inherit from your parents causes Gilbert's syndrome.	general
The gene normally controls an enzyme that helps break down bilirubin in your liver.	general
When you have an ineffective gene, your blood contains excess amounts of bilirubin because your body doesn't produce enough of the enzyme.	general
How the body normally processes bilirubin Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment made when your body breaks down old red blood cells.	general
Bilirubin travels through your bloodstream to the liver, where the enzyme breaks down the pigment and removes it from the bloodstream.	general
The bilirubin passes from the liver into the intestines with bile.	general
It's then excreted in stool.	general
A small amount of bilirubin remains in the blood.	general
How the abnormal gene is passed through families The abnormal gene that causes Gilbert's syndrome is common.	general
Many people carry one copy of this gene.	general
In most cases, two abnormal copies are needed to cause Gilbert's syndrome.	general
Risk factors Although it's present from birth, Gilbert's syndrome usually isn't noticed until puberty or later, since bilirubin production increases during puberty.	general
You have an increased risk of Gilbert's syndrome if: Both your parents carry the abnormal gene that causes the disorder You're male Complications The low level of the bilirubin-processing enzyme that causes Gilbert's syndrome may also increase the side effects of certain medications, since this enzyme plays a role in helping clear these medications from your body.	general
These medications include: Some protease inhibitors used to treat HIV If you have Gilbert's syndrome, talk to your doctor before taking new medications.	general
Also, having any other condition that impairs the destruction of red blood cells may increase your risk of developing gallstones.	general
Gingivitis is a common and mild form of gum disease (periodontal disease) that causes irritation, redness and swelling (inflammation) of your gingiva, the part of your gum around the base of your teeth.	general
It's important to take gingivitis seriously and treat it promptly.	general
Gingivitis can lead to much more serious gum disease called periodontitis and tooth loss.	general
The most common cause of gingivitis is poor oral hygiene.	general
Good oral health habits, such as brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups, can help prevent and reverse gingivitis.	general
Gingivitis can cause dusky red, swollen, tender gums that bleed easily, especially when you brush your teeth.	general
Healthy gums are firm and pale pink and fitted tightly around the teeth.	general
Signs and symptoms of gingivitis include: Swollen or puffy gums Gums that bleed easily when you brush or floss Receding gums Tender gums When to see a dentist If you notice any signs and symptoms of gingivitis, schedule an appointment with your dentist.	general
The sooner you seek care, the better your chances of reversing damage from gingivitis and preventing its progression to periodontitis.	general
The most common cause of gingivitis is poor oral hygiene that encourages plaque to form on teeth, causing inflammation of the surrounding gum tissues.	general
Here's how plaque can lead to gingivitis: Plaque is an invisible, sticky film composed mainly of bacteria that forms on your teeth when starches and sugars in food interact with bacteria normally found in your mouth.	general
Plaque requires daily removal because it re-forms quickly.	general
Plaque forms on your teeth.	general
Plaque that stays on your teeth can harden under your gumline into tartar (calculus), which collects bacteria.	general
Tartar makes plaque more difficult to remove, creates a protective shield for bacteria and causes irritation along the gumline.	general
You need professional dental cleaning to remove tartar.	general
Plaque turns into tartar.	general
The longer that plaque and tartar remain on your teeth, the more they irritate the gingiva, the part of your gum around the base of your teeth, causing inflammation.	general
In time, your gums become swollen and bleed easily.	general
Tooth decay (dental caries) also may result.	general
If not treated, gingivitis can advance to periodontitis and eventual tooth loss.	general
Gingiva become inflamed (gingivitis).	general
Risk factors Gingivitis is common, and anyone can develop it.	general
Factors that can increase your risk of gingivitis include: Poor oral care habits Smoking or chewing tobacco Poor nutrition, including vitamin C deficiency Dental restorations that don't fit properly or crooked teeth that are difficult to clean Conditions that decrease immunity such as leukemia, HIV/AIDS or cancer treatment Certain drugs, such as phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek) for epileptic seizures, and some calcium channel blockers, used for angina, high blood pressure and other conditions Hormonal changes, such as those related to pregnancy, menstrual cycle or use of birth control pills Complications Untreated gingivitis can progress to gum disease that spreads to underlying tissue and bone (periodontitis), a much more serious condition that can lead to tooth loss.	general
Chronic gingiva inflammation has been thought to be associated with some systemic diseases such as respiratory disease, diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis.	general
Some research suggests that the bacteria responsible for periodontitis can enter your bloodstream through gum tissue, possibly affecting your heart, lungs and other parts of your body.	general
But more studies are needed to confirm a link.	general
Trench mouth, also known as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG), is a severe form of gingivitis that causes painful, infected, bleeding gums and ulcerations.	general
Trench mouth is rare today in developed nations, though it's common in developing countries that have poor nutrition and poor living conditions.	general
That means brushing your teeth for two minutes at least twice daily ‚Äî in the morning and before going to bed ‚Äî and flossing at least once a day.	general
Better yet, brush after every meal or snack or as your dentist recommends.	general
Flossing before you brush allows you to clean away the loosened food particles and bacteria.	general
Good oral hygiene.	general
See your dentist or dental hygienist regularly for cleanings, usually every six to 12 months.	general
If you have risk factors that increase your chance of developing periodontitis ‚Äî such as having dry mouth, taking certain medications or smoking ‚Äî you may need professional cleaning more often.	general
Annual dental X-rays can help identify diseases that are not seen by a visual dental examination and monitor for changes in your dental health.	general
Regular dental visits.	general
Practices such as healthy eating and managing blood sugar if you have diabetes also are important to maintain gum health.	general
Good health practices.	general
Open-angle glaucoma Open-angle glaucoma Normally, fluid (aqueous humor) in the eye flows freely through the anterior chamber and exits through the drainage system (trabecular meshwork).	general
If that system is blocked or isn't functioning well, the pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure) builds, which in turn damages the optic nerve.	general
With the most common type of glaucoma, this results in gradual vision loss.	general
Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, the health of which is vital for good vision.	general
This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in your eye.	general
Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60.	general
It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults.	general
Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs.	general
The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is at an advanced stage.	general
Because vision loss due to glaucoma can't be recovered, it's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure so a diagnosis can be made in its early stages and treated appropriately.	general
If glaucoma is recognized early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented.	general
If you have the condition, you'll generally need treatment for the rest of your life.	general
Products & Services The signs and symptoms of glaucoma vary depending on the type and stage of your condition.	general
For example: Open-angle glaucoma Patchy blind spots in your side (peripheral) or central vision, frequently in both eyes Tunnel vision in the advanced stages Acute angle-closure glaucoma Eye redness If left untreated, glaucoma will eventually cause blindness.	general
Even with treatment, about 15 percent of people with glaucoma become blind in at least one eye within 20 years.	general
When to see a doctor Promptly go to an emergency room or an eye doctor's (ophthalmologist's) office if you experience some of the symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma, such as severe headache, eye pain and blurred vision.	general
Glaucoma is the result of damage to the optic nerve.	general
As this nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in your visual field.	general
For reasons that doctors don't fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye.	general
Elevated eye pressure is due to a buildup of a fluid (aqueous humor) that flows throughout the inside of your eye.	general
This internal fluid normally drains out through a tissue called the trabecular meshwork at the angle where the iris and cornea meet.	general
When fluid is overproduced or the drainage system doesn't work properly, the fluid can't flow out at its normal rate and eye pressure increases.	general
Glaucoma tends to run in families.	general
In some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage.	general
Types of glaucoma include: Open-angle glaucoma Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of the disease.	general
The drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris remains open, but the trabecular meshwork is partially blocked.	general
This causes pressure in the eye to gradually increase.	general
This pressure damages the optic nerve.	general
It happens so slowly that you may lose vision before you're even aware of a problem.	general
Angle-closure glaucoma Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma, occurs when the iris bulges forward to narrow or block the drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris.	general
As a result, fluid can't circulate through the eye and pressure increases.	general
Some people have narrow drainage angles, putting them at increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma.	general
Angle-closure glaucoma may occur suddenly (acute angle-closure glaucoma) or gradually (chronic angle-closure glaucoma).	general
Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency.	general
Normal-tension glaucoma In normal-tension glaucoma, your optic nerve becomes damaged even though your eye pressure is within the normal range.	general
No one knows the exact reason for this.	general
You may have a sensitive optic nerve, or you may have less blood being supplied to your optic nerve.	general
This limited blood flow could be caused by atherosclerosis ‚Äî the buildup of fatty deposits (plaque) in the arteries ‚Äî or other conditions that impair circulation.	general
Glaucoma in children It's possible for infants and children to have glaucoma.	general
It may be present from birth or develop in the first few years of life.	general
The optic nerve damage may be caused by drainage blockages or an underlying medical condition.	general
Pigmentary glaucoma In pigmentary glaucoma, pigment granules from your iris build up in the drainage channels, slowing or blocking fluid exiting your eye.	general
Activities such as jogging sometimes stir up the pigment granules, depositing them on the trabecular meshwork and causing intermittent pressure elevations.	general
Risk factors Because chronic forms of glaucoma can destroy vision before any signs or symptoms are apparent, be aware of these risk factors: Having high internal eye pressure (intraocular pressure) Being over age 60 Having a family history of glaucoma Having certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and sickle cell anemia Having corneas that are thin in the center Being extremely nearsighted or farsighted Having had an eye injury or certain types of eye surgery Taking corticosteroid medications, especially eyedrops, for a long time These self-care steps can help you detect glaucoma in its early stages, which is important in preventing vision loss or slowing its progress.	general
Regular comprehensive eye exams can help detect glaucoma in its early stages, before significant damage occurs.	general
As a general rule, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends having a comprehensive eye exam every five to 10 years if you're under 40 years old; every two to four years if you're 40 to 54 years old; every one to three years if you're 55 to 64 years old; and every one to two years if you're older than 65.	general
If you're at risk of glaucoma, you'll need more frequent screening.	general
Ask your doctor to recommend the right screening schedule for you.	general
Get regular dilated eye examinations.	general
Glaucoma tends to run in families.	general
If you're at increased risk, you may need more frequent screening.	general
Know your family's eye health history.	general
Regular, moderate exercise may help prevent glaucoma by reducing eye pressure.	general
Talk with your doctor about an appropriate exercise program.	general
Exercise safely.	general
Glaucoma eyedrops can significantly reduce the risk that high eye pressure will progress to glaucoma.	general
To be effective, eyedrops prescribed by your doctor need to be used regularly even if you have no symptoms.	general
Take prescribed eyedrops regularly.	general
Serious eye injuries can lead to glaucoma.	general
Wear eye protection when using power tools or playing high-speed racket sports in enclosed courts.	general
Wear eye protection.	general
Glioblastoma Glioblastoma Glioblastoma Glioblastoma is an aggressive type of cancer that begins in cells called astrocytes that support nerve cells.	general
It can form in the brain or spinal cord.	general
Glioblastoma is also known as glioblastoma multiforme.	general
Glioblastoma is an aggressive type of cancer that can occur in the brain or spinal cord.	general
Glioblastoma forms from cells called astrocytes that support nerve cells.	general
Glioblastoma can occur at any age, but tends to occur more often in older adults.	general
It can cause worsening headaches, nausea, vomiting and seizures.	general
Glioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma multiforme, can be very difficult to treat and a cure is often not possible.	general
Treatments may slow progression of the cancer and reduce signs and symptoms.	general
Tests and procedures used to diagnose glioblastoma include: During a neurological exam, your doctor will ask you about your signs and symptoms.	general
He or she may check your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes.	general
Problems in one or more of these areas may provide clues about the part of your brain that could be affected by a brain tumor.	general
Neurological exam.	general
Imaging tests can help your doctor determine the location and size of your brain tumor.	general
MRI is often used to diagnose brain tumors, and it may be used along with specialized MRI imaging, such as functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	general
Imaging tests.	general
Other imaging tests may include CT and positron emission tomography (PET).	general
A biopsy can be done with a needle before surgery or during surgery to remove your glioblastoma, depending on your particular situation and the location of your tumor.	general
The sample of suspicious tissue is analyzed in a laboratory to determine the types of cells and their level of aggressiveness.	general
Removing a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy).	general
Specialized tests of the tumor cells can tell your doctor the types of mutations the cells have acquired.	general
This gives your doctor clues about your prognosis and may guide your treatment options.	general
Glioblastoma treatment options include: Your brain surgeon (neurosurgeon) will work to remove the glioblastoma.	general
The goal is to remove as much of the tumor as possible.	general
But because glioblastoma grows into the normal brain tissue, complete removal isn't possible.	general
For this reason, most people receive additional treatments after surgery to target the remaining cells.	general
Surgery to remove the glioblastoma.	general
Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells.	general
During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around you, directing beams to precise points in your brain.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Radiation therapy is usually recommended after surgery and may be combined with chemotherapy.	general
For people who can't undergo surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used as a primary treatment.	general
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells.	general
In some cases, thin, circular wafers containing chemotherapy medicine may be placed in your brain during surgery.	general
The wafers dissolve slowly, releasing the medicine and killing cancer cells.	general
Chemotherapy.	general
After surgery, the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (Temodar) ‚Äî taken as a pill ‚Äî is often used during and after radiation therapy.	general
Other types of chemotherapy may be recommended if your glioblastoma recurs.	general
These other types of chemotherapy are often administered through a vein in your arm.	general
TTF uses an electrical field to disrupt the tumor cells' ability to multiply.	general
TTF involves applying adhesive pads to your scalp.	general
The pads are connected to a portable device that generates the electrical field.	general
Tumor treating fields (TTF) therapy.	general
TTF is combined with chemotherapy and may be recommended after radiation therapy.	general
Targeted drugs focus on specific abnormalities in cancer cells that allow them to grow and thrive.	general
The drugs attack those abnormalities, causing the cancer cells to die.	general
Targeted drug therapy.	general
Bevacizumab (Avastin) targets the signals that glioblastoma cells send to the body that cause new blood vessels to form and deliver blood and nutrients to cancer cells.	general
Bevacizumab may be an option if your glioblastoma recurs or doesn't respond to other treatments.	general
Clinical trials are studies of new treatments.	general
These studies give you a chance to try the latest treatment options, but the risk of side effects may not be known.	general
Ask your doctor whether you might be eligible to participate in a clinical trial.	general
Clinical trials.	general
Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness.	general
Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care.	general
Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.	general

Krabbe (KRAH-buh) disease is an inherited disorder that destroys the protective coating (myelin) of nerve cells in the brain and throughout the nervous system.	general
In most cases, signs and symptoms of Krabbe disease develop in babies before 6 months of age, and the disease usually results in death by age 2.	general
When it develops in older children and adults, the course of the disease can vary greatly.	general
There's no cure for Krabbe disease, and treatment focuses on supportive care.	general
However, stem cell transplants have shown some success in infants who are treated before the onset of symptoms and in some older children and adults.	general
Krabbe disease affects about 1 in 100,000 people in the United States.	general
It is also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy.	general
In most cases, the signs and symptoms of Krabbe disease appear during the first 2 to 5 months of life.	general
They begin gradually and progressively worsen.	general
Common signs and symptoms early in the course of the disease include the following: Feeding difficulties Unexplained crying Extreme irritability Declines in alertness Muscle spasms Frequent vomiting As the disease progresses, signs and symptoms become more severe.	general
They may include: Rigid, constricted muscles Stiff, fixed posture Older children and adults When Krabbe disease develops later in childhood or during adulthood, signs and symptoms can vary widely.	general
They may include: Progressive loss of vision Muscle weakness As a general rule, the younger the age that Krabbe disease occurs, the faster the disease progresses and the more likely it is to result in death.	general
Some people diagnosed during adolescence or adulthood may have less severe symptoms, with muscle weakness as a primary condition.	general
They may have no impairment of their thinking skills.	general
When to see a doctor The early signs and symptoms of Krabbe disease in infancy can indicate any number of diseases or developmental problems.	general
Therefore, it's important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis if your child is experiencing any signs or symptoms of the disease.	general
Signs and symptoms most often associated with older children and adults also are not specific to Krabbe disease and require a timely diagnosis.	general
Krabbe disease is caused when a person inherits two copies of an altered (mutated) gene ‚Äî one copy from each parent.	general
A gene provides a kind of blueprint for producing proteins.	general
If there is an error in this blueprint, then the protein product may not work properly.	general
In the case of Krabbe disease, two mutated copies of a particular gene result in little or no production of an enzyme called galactocerebrosidase (GALC).	general
Enzymes, such as GALC, are responsible for breaking down certain substances in a cell's recycling center (lysosome).	general
In Krabbe disease, the short supply of GALC enzymes results in the accumulation of certain types of fats called galactolipids.	general
Damage to nerve cells Galactolipids normally exist in cells that produce and maintain the protective coating of nerve cells (myelin).	general
However, an abundance of galactolipids has a toxic effect.	general
Some galactolipids trigger myelin-forming cells to self-destruct.	general
Other galactolipids are taken up by specialized debris-eating cells in the nervous system called microglia.	general
The process of cleaning up excessive galactolipids transforms these normally helpful cells into abnormal, toxic cells called globoid cells, which promote myelin-damaging inflammation.	general
The subsequent loss of myelin (demyelination) prevents nerve cells from sending and receiving messages.	general
Risk factors Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern To have an autosomal recessive disorder, you inherit two mutated genes, one from each parent.	general
These disorders are usually passed on by two carriers.	general
Their health is rarely affected, but they have one mutated gene (recessive gene) and one normal gene (dominant gene) for the condition.	general
Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes (left), a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier (middle) and a 25% chance of having an affected child with two recessive genes (right).	general
The gene mutation associated with Krabbe disease only causes the disease if two mutated copies of the gene are inherited.	general
A disease resulting from two mutated copies is called an autosomal recessive disorder.	general
If each parent has one mutated copy of the gene, the risk for a child would be as follows: A 25 percent chance of inheriting two mutated copies, which would result in the disease A 50 percent chance of inheriting only one mutated copy, which would result in the child being a carrier of the mutation but would not result in the disease itself A 25 percent chance of inheriting two normal copies of the gene Genetic testing Genetic testing to understand the risk of having a child with Krabbe disease may be considered in certain situations: If one or both parents are likely carriers of a GALC gene mutation because of a known family history of Krabbe disease, a couple may want to have tests to understand the risks in their own family.	general
If one child is diagnosed with Krabbe disease, a family may consider genetic tests to identify other children who could develop the disease later in life.	general
If the parents are known carriers, they may request a prenatal genetic test to determine if their child is likely to develop the disease.	general
Known carriers, who are using in vitro fertilization, may request a genetic test with fertilized eggs before implantation.	general
Genetic testing should be carefully considered.	general
Ask your doctor about genetic counseling services that can help you understand the benefits, limits and implications of genetic testing.	general
Complications A number of complications ‚Äî including infections and respiratory difficulties ‚Äî can develop in children with advanced Krabbe disease.	general
In the later stages of the disease, children become incapacitated, are confined to their beds and eventually lapse into a vegetative state.	general
Most children who develop Krabbe disease in infancy die before the age of 2, most often from respiratory failure or complications of immobility and markedly decreased muscle tone.	general
Children who develop the disease later in childhood may have a somewhat longer life expectancy, usually between two and seven years after diagnosis.	general
Kidney cross section Kidney cross section Blood enters your kidneys through your renal arteries.	general
Your kidneys remove excess fluid and waste material from your blood through units called nephrons.	general
Each nephron contains a filter (glomerulus) that has a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.	general
The glomeruli filter waste products and substances your body needs ‚Äî such as sodium, phosphorus and potassium ‚Äî which then pass through tiny tubules.	general
The substances your body needs are reabsorbed into your bloodstream.	general
The waste products and excess fluid form urine, which flows through the ureters ‚Äî the tubes that lead to the bladder.	general
Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis) is inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys (glomeruli).	general
Glomeruli remove excess fluid, electrolytes and waste from your bloodstream and pass them into your urine.	general
Glomerulonephritis can come on suddenly (acute) or gradually (chronic).	general
Glomerulonephritis occurs on its own or as part of another disease, such as lupus or diabetes.	general
Severe or prolonged inflammation associated with glomerulonephritis can damage your kidneys.	general
Treatment depends on the type of glomerulonephritis you have.	general
Signs and symptoms of glomerulonephritis depend on whether you have the acute or chronic form and the cause.	general
Your first indication that something is wrong might come from symptoms or from the results of a routine urinalysis.	general
Glomerulonephritis signs and symptoms include: Pink or cola-colored urine from red blood cells in your urine (hematuria) Foamy urine due to excess protein (proteinuria) High blood pressure (hypertension) Fluid retention (edema) with swelling evident in your face, hands, feet and abdomen When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor promptly if you have signs or symptoms that concern you.	general
Many conditions can cause glomerulonephritis.	general
Sometimes the disease runs in families and sometimes the cause is unknown.	general
Conditions that can lead to inflammation of the kidneys' glomeruli include: Glomerulonephritis may develop a week or two after recovery from a strep throat infection or, rarely, a skin infection (impetigo).	general
To fight the infection, your body produces extra antibodies that can eventually settle in the glomeruli, causing inflammation.	general
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.	general
Children are more likely to develop post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis than are adults, and they're also more likely to recover quickly.	general
Bacteria occasionally can spread through your bloodstream and lodge in your heart, causing an infection of one or more of your heart valves.	general
You're at greater risk of this condition if you have a heart defect, such as a damaged or artificial heart valve.	general
Bacterial endocarditis is associated with glomerular disease, but the connection between the two is unclear.	general
Bacterial endocarditis.	general
Viral infections, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C, can trigger glomerulonephritis.	general
Viral infections.	general
Immune diseases A chronic inflammatory disease, lupus can affect many parts of your body, including your skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs.	general
A rare immunological lung disorder that can mimic pneumonia, Goodpasture's syndrome causes bleeding in your lungs as well as glomerulonephritis.	general
Goodpasture's syndrome.	general
Characterized by recurrent episodes of blood in the urine, this primary glomerular disease results from deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the glomeruli.	general
IgA nephropathy can progress for years with no noticeable symptoms.	general
IgA nephropathy.	general
This form of vasculitis affects small and medium blood vessels in many parts of your body, such as your heart, kidneys and intestines.	general
Polyarteritis.	general
This form of vasculitis, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, ¬†affects small and medium blood vessels in your lungs, upper airways and kidneys.	general
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.	general
Conditions likely to cause scarring of the glomeruli This can damage your kidneys and impair their ability to function normally.	general
Glomerulonephritis can also lead to high blood pressure because it reduces kidney function and can influence how your kidneys handle sodium.	general
High blood pressure.	general
This can affect anyone with diabetes, usually taking years to develop.	general
Good control of blood sugar levels and blood pressure might prevent or slow kidney damage.	general
Diabetic kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy).	general
Characterized by scattered scarring of some of the glomeruli, this condition can result from another disease or occur for no known reason.	general
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.	general
Infrequently, chronic glomerulonephritis runs in families.	general
One inherited form, Alport syndrome, also might impair hearing or vision.	general
In addition to the causes listed above, glomerulonephritis is associated with certain cancers, such as multiple myeloma, lung cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	general
Complications Glomerulonephritis can damage your kidneys so that they lose their filtering ability.	general
As a result, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and waste build up in your body.	general
Possible complications of glomerulonephritis include: Loss of function in the filtering part of the nephron can result in ¬†rapid accumulation of waste products.	general
You might need emergency dialysis ‚Äî an artificial means of removing extra fluids and waste from your blood ‚Äî typically by an artificial kidney machine.	general
Acute kidney failure.	general
Your kidneys gradually lose their filtering ability.	general
Kidney function that deteriorates to less than 10 percent of normal capacity results in end-stage kidney disease, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to sustain life.	general
Chronic kidney disease.	general
Damage to your kidneys and the resulting buildup of wastes in the bloodstream can raise your blood pressure.	general
High blood pressure.	general
With this syndrome, too much protein in your urine results in too little protein in your blood.	general
Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with high blood cholesterol and swelling (edema) of the eyelids, feet and abdomen.	general
Nephrotic syndrome.	general
There may be no way to prevent most forms of glomerulonephritis.	general
However, here are some steps that might be beneficial: Seek prompt treatment of a strep infection with a sore throat or impetigo.	general
To prevent infections that can lead to some forms of glomerulonephritis, such as HIV and hepatitis, follow safe-sex guidelines and avoid intravenous drug use.	general
Control high blood pressure, which lessens the likelihood of damage to your kidneys from hypertension.	general
Control your blood sugar to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.	general
Golfer's elbow is a condition that causes pain where the tendons of your forearm muscles attach to the bony bump on the inside of your elbow.	general
The pain might spread into your forearm and wrist.	general
Golfer's elbow is similar to tennis elbow, which occurs on the outside of the elbow.	general
It's not limited to golfers.	general
Tennis players and others who repeatedly use their wrists or clench their fingers also can develop golfer's elbow.	general
The pain of golfer's elbow doesn't have to keep you off the course or away from your favorite activities.	general
Rest and appropriate treatment can get you back into the swing of things.	general
Products & Services Golfer's elbow Golfer's elbow The pain of golfer's elbow occurs primarily where the tendons of the forearm muscles attach to the bony bump on the inside of the elbow (medial epicondyle).	general
By contrast, the pain of tennis elbow usually occurs at the bony bump on the outside of the elbow (lateral epicondyle).	general
Golfer's elbow is characterized by: Usually felt on the inner side of your elbow, the pain sometimes extends along the inner side of your forearm.	general
Pain typically worsens with certain movements.	general
Pain and tenderness.	general
Your elbow may feel stiff, and making a fist might hurt.	general
You may have weakness in your hands and wrists.	general
These sensations might radiate into one or more fingers ‚Äî usually the ring and little fingers.	general
Numbness or tingling.	general
The pain of golfer's elbow can come on suddenly or gradually.	general
The pain might worsen with certain movements, such as swinging a golf club.	general
When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if rest, ice and over-the-counter pain relievers don't ease your elbow pain and tenderness.	general
Seek immediate care if: Your elbow is hot and inflamed, and you have a fever You can't bend your elbow Your elbow looks deformed Golfer's elbow, also known as medial epicondylitis, is caused by damage to the muscles and tendons that control your wrist and fingers.	general
The damage is typically related to excess or repeated stress ‚Äî especially forceful wrist and finger motions.	general
Improper lifting, throwing or hitting, as well as too little warmup or poor conditioning, also can contribute to golfer's elbow.	general
Besides golf, many activities and occupations can lead to golfer's elbow, including: Improper technique with tennis strokes, especially the backhand, can cause injury to the tendon.	general
Excessive use of topspin and using a racket that's too small or heavy also can lead to injury.	general
Racket sports.	general
Improper pitching technique in baseball or softball can be another culprit.	general
Football, archery and javelin throwing also can cause golfer's elbow.	general
Throwing sports.	general
Lifting weights using improper technique, such as curling the wrists during a biceps exercise, can overload the elbow muscles and tendons.	general
Weight training.	general
These occur in fields such as construction, plumbing and carpentry Forceful, repetitive occupational movements.	general
To cause golfer's elbow, the activity generally needs to be done for more than an hour a day on many days.	general
Risk factors You could be at higher risk of developing golfer's elbow if you're: Age 40 or older You can take steps to prevent golfer's elbow: Use light weights or squeeze a tennis ball.	general
Even simple exercises can help your muscles absorb the energy of sudden physical stress.	general
Strengthen your forearm muscles.	general
Walk or jog for a few minutes to warm up your muscles.	general
Then do gentle stretches before you begin your game.	general
Stretch before your activity.	general
Whatever your sport, ask an instructor to check your form to avoid overload on muscles.	general
Fix your form.	general
If you're using older golfing irons, consider upgrading to lighter graphite clubs.	general
If you play tennis, make sure your racket fits you.	general
A racket with a small grip or a heavy head may increase the risk of elbow problems.	general
Use the right equipment.	general
When lifting anything ‚Äî including free weights ‚Äî keep your wrist rigid and stable to reduce the force to your elbow.	general
Lift properly.	general
Try not to overuse your elbow.	general
At the first sign of elbow pain, take a break.	general
Know when to rest.	general
Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that infects both males and females.	general
Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat.	general
In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix.	general
Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during vaginal, oral or anal sex.	general
But babies of infected mothers can be infected during childbirth.	general
In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes.	general
Abstaining from sex, using a condom if you have sex and being in a mutually monogamous relationship are the best ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections.	general
Male reproductive system Male reproductive system The male reproductive system makes, stores and moves sperm.	general
The testicles produce sperm.	general
Fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland combines with sperm to make semen.	general
The penis ejaculates semen during sexual intercourse.	general
Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.	general
In many cases, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms.	general
Symptoms, however, can affect many sites in your body, but commonly appear in the genital tract.	general
Gonorrhea affecting the genital tract Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in men include: Painful urination Pain or swelling in one testicle Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in women include: Increased vaginal discharge Abdominal or pelvic pain Gonorrhea can also affect these parts of the body: Signs and symptoms include anal itching, pus-like discharge from the rectum, spots of bright red blood on toilet tissue and having to strain during bowel movements.	general
Gonorrhea that affects your eyes can cause eye pain, sensitivity to light, and pus-like discharge from one or both eyes.	general
Signs and symptoms of a throat infection might include a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.	general
If one or more joints become infected by bacteria (septic arthritis), the affected joints might be warm, red, swollen and extremely painful, especially during movement.	general
When to see your doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any troubling signs or symptoms, such as a burning sensation when you urinate or a pus-like discharge from your penis, vagina or rectum.	general
Also make an appointment with your doctor if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea.	general
You may not experience signs or symptoms that prompt you to seek medical attention.	general
But without treatment, you can reinfect your partner even after he or she has been treated for gonorrhea.	general
Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.	general
The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse.	general
Risk factors Sexually active women younger than 25 and men who have sex with men are at increased risk of getting gonorrhea.	general
Other factors that can increase your risk include: Having a new sex partner Having a sex partner who has other partners Having more than one sex partner Having had gonorrhea or another sexually transmitted infection Complications Untreated gonorrhea can lead to major complications, such as: Gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).	general
can result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility.	general
requires immediate treatment.	general
Infertility in women.	general
Gonorrhea can cause a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis) to become inflamed (epididymitis).	general
Untreated epididymitis can lead to infertility.	general
Infertility in men.	general
The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints.	general
Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results.	general
Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body.	general
Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to .	general
People who have both gonorrhea and are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners.	general
Increased risk of HIV/AIDS.	general
Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections.	general
Complications in babies.	general
To reduce your gonorrhea risk: Abstaining from sex is the surest way to prevent gonorrhea.	general
But if you choose to have sex, use a condom during any type of sexual contact, including anal sex, oral sex or vaginal sex.	general
Use a condom if you have sex.	general
Being in a monogamous relationship in which neither partner has sex with anyone else can lower your risk.	general
Limit your number of sex partners.	general
Before you have sex, get tested and share your results with each other.	general
Be sure you and your partner are tested for sexually transmitted infections.	general
If your partner has signs or symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection, such as burning during urination or a genital rash or sore, don't have sex with that person.	general
Don't have sex with someone who appears to have a sexually transmitted infection.	general
Annual screening is recommended for sexually active women younger than 25 and for older women at increased risk of infection.	general
This includes women who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with other partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection.	general
Consider regular gonorrhea screening.	general
Regular screening is also recommended for men who have sex with men, as well as their partners.	general
To avoid getting gonorrhea again, abstain from sex until after you and your sex partner have completed treatment and after symptoms are gone.	general
A grand mal seizure causes a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions.	general
It's the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures.	general
A grand mal seizure ‚Äî also known as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure ‚Äî is caused by abnormal electrical activity throughout the brain.	general
Usually, a grand mal seizure is caused by epilepsy.	general
But sometimes, this type of seizure can be triggered by other health problems, such as extremely low blood sugar, a high fever or a stroke.	general
Many people who have a grand mal seizure never have another one and don't need treatment.	general
But someone who has recurrent seizures may need treatment with daily anti-seizure medications to control and prevent future grand mal seizures.	general
Grand mal seizures have two stages: Loss of consciousness occurs, and the muscles suddenly contract and cause the person to fall down.	general
This phase tends to last about 10 to 20 seconds.	general
Tonic phase.	general
The muscles go into rhythmic contractions, alternately flexing and relaxing.	general
Convulsions usually last one to two minutes or less.	general
Clonic phase.	general
The following signs and symptoms occur in some but not all people with grand mal seizures: Some people may cry out at the beginning of a seizure.	general
This may happen during or following a seizure.	general
Loss of bowel and bladder control.	general
Unconsciousness may persist for several minutes after the convulsion has ended.	general
Unresponsiveness after convulsions.	general
A period of disorientation often follows a grand mal seizure.	general
This is referred to as postictal confusion.	general
Sleepiness is common after a grand mal seizure.	general
Headaches may occur after a grand mal seizure.	general
Severe headache.	general
When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops A second seizure follows immediately You have a high fever You're experiencing heat exhaustion.	general
You've injured yourself during the seizure.	general
If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice.	general
Additionally, seek medical advice for yourself or your child: If the number of seizures experienced increases significantly without explanation If new seizure signs or symptoms appear Grand mal seizures occur when the electrical activity over the whole surface of the brain becomes abnormally synchronized.	general
The brain's nerve cells normally communicate with each other by sending electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect the cells.	general
In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered and many nerve cells fire at the same time.	general
Exactly what causes the changes to occur often remains unknown.	general
However, grand mal seizures are sometimes caused by underlying health problems, such as: Injury or infection Traumatic head injuries Infections, such as encephalitis or meningitis, or a history of such infections Injury due to a previous lack of oxygen Genetic syndromes Brain tumors Metabolic disturbances Very low blood levels of glucose, sodium, calcium or magnesium Withdrawal syndromes Risk factors A family history of seizure disorders Any injury to the brain from trauma, a stroke, previous infection and other causes Sleep deprivation Illicit drug use Heavy alcohol use Complications Having a seizure at certain times can lead to circumstances that are dangerous for you or others.	general
You might be at risk of: If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone.	general
If you have a seizure while swimming or bathing, you're at risk of accidental drowning.	general
A seizure that causes either loss of awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment.	general
Car accidents.	general
Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby, and certain anti-epileptic medications increase the risk of birth defects.	general
If you have epilepsy and plan to become pregnant, work with your doctor so that he or she can adjust your medications and monitor your pregnancy, as needed.	general
Pregnancy complications.	general
People with seizures are more likely to have psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety.	general
Problems may be a result of difficulties dealing with the condition itself as well as medication side effects.	general
Emotional health issues.	general

Granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition that causes raised reddish or skin-colored bumps (lesions) in a ring pattern, usually on the hands and feet.	general
Granuloma annulare (gran-u-LOW-muh an-u-LAR-e) is a skin condition that causes raised reddish or skin-colored bumps (lesions) in a ring pattern.	general
The bumps are usually on the hands and feet.	general
Minor skin injuries and some drugs might trigger the condition.	general
Different types affect adults and children.	general
The lesions usually disappear on their own within two years without treatment.	general
But if you're bothered by how your skin looks or feels, your doctor can prescribe medications that can speed the disappearance of the condition.	general
The signs and symptoms of granuloma annulare can vary, depending on the variety: This is the most common type of granuloma annulare.	general
The bump (lesion) borders are circular or semicircular, with a diameter up to 2 inches (5 centimeters).	general
The reddish or skin-colored bumps occur most commonly on the hands, feet, wrists and ankles of young adults.	general
Less commonly, adults experience this type, which causes itchy, reddish or skin-colored bumps on most of the body, including the trunk, arms and legs.	general
Generalized.	general
A type that usually affects young children is called subcutaneous granuloma annulare.	general
It produces small, firm lumps under the skin, instead of a rash.	general
The lumps form on the hands, shins and scalp.	general
Under the skin.	general
When to see a doctor Call your doctor if your skin develops reddish bumps (lesions) in ring patterns that don't go away within a few weeks.	general
It's not clear what causes granuloma annulare.	general
Sometimes it's triggered by: Animal or insect bites Infections, such as hepatitis Risk factors Granuloma annulare is occasionally associated with diabetes or thyroid disease, most often when lesions are numerous or widespread.	general
It may, rarely, be related to cancer, especially in older people whose granuloma annulare is severe, doesn't respond to treatment or returns after cancer treatment.	general
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is an uncommon disorder that causes inflammation of the blood vessels in your nose, sinuses, throat, lungs and kidneys.	general
Formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis, this condition is one of a group of blood vessel disorders called vasculitis.	general
It slows blood flow to some of your organs.	general
The affected tissues can develop areas of inflammation called granulomas, which can affect how these organs work.	general
Early diagnosis and treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis might lead to a full recovery.	general
Without treatment, the condition can be fatal.	general
Signs and symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis can develop suddenly or over several months.	general
The first warning signs usually involve your sinuses, throat or lungs.	general
The condition often worsens rapidly, affecting blood vessels and the organs they supply, such as the kidneys.	general
Signs and symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis might include: Pus-like drainage with crusts from your nose, stuffiness, sinus infections and nosebleeds Coughing, sometimes with bloody phlegm Shortness of breath or wheezing Weight loss Eye redness, burning or pain, and vision problems Ear inflammation and hearing problems For some people, the disease affects only the lungs.	general
When the kidneys are affected, blood and urine tests can detect the problem.	general
Without treatment, kidney or lung failure can occur.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have a runny nose that doesn't respond to over-the-counter cold medicines, especially if it's accompanied by nosebleeds and pus-like material, coughing up blood, or other warning signs of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.	general
Because this disease can worsen quickly, early diagnosis is key to getting effective treatment.	general
The cause of granulomatosis with polyangiitis isn't known.	general
It's not contagious, and there's no evidence that it's inherited.	general
The condition can lead to inflamed, narrowed blood vessels and harmful inflammatory tissue masses (granulomas).	general
Granulomas can destroy normal tissue, and narrowed blood vessels reduce the amount of blood and oxygen that reaches your body's tissues and organs.	general
Risk factors Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can occur at any age.	general
It most often affects people between the ages of 40 and 65.	general
Complications Besides affecting your nose, sinuses, throat, lungs and kidneys, granulomatosis with polyangiitis can affect your skin, eyes, ears, heart and other organs.	general
Thyroid gland Thyroid gland Your thyroid gland is located at the base of your neck, just below the Adam's apple.	general
Graves' disease is an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism).	general
Although a number of disorders may result in hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease is a common cause.	general
Because thyroid hormones affect a number of different body systems, signs and symptoms associated with Graves' disease can be wide ranging and significantly influence your overall well-being.	general
Although Graves' disease may affect anyone, it's more common among women and before the age of 40.	general
The primary treatment goals are to inhibit the overproduction of thyroid hormones and lessen the severity of symptoms.	general
Enlarged thyroid Enlarged thyroid Widespread enlargement of your thyroid can expand the gland well beyond its normal size (left) and cause a noticeable bulge in your neck (right).	general
Graves' ophthalmopathy Graves' ophthalmopathy Graves' dermopathy Graves' dermopathy Graves' dermopathy Rarely, people with Graves' disease develop a reddish thickening of the skin that resembles the texture of an orange peel (Graves' dermopathy).	general
This results from a buildup of certain carbohydrates in the skin.	general
It often occurs on the shins and on the tops of the feet.	general
Common signs and symptoms of Graves' disease include: Anxiety and irritability A fine tremor of your hands or fingers Heat sensitivity and an increase in perspiration or warm, moist skin Weight loss, despite normal eating habits Enlargement of your thyroid gland (goiter) Change in menstrual cycles Frequent bowel movements Thick, red skin usually on the shins or tops of the feet (Graves' dermopathy) Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations) Graves' ophthalmopathy About 30 percent of people with Graves' disease show some signs and symptoms of a condition known as Graves' ophthalmopathy.	general
In Graves' ophthalmopathy, inflammation and other immune system events affect muscles and other tissues around your eyes.	general
The resulting signs and symptoms may include: Bulging eyes (exophthalmos) Pressure or pain in the eyes Puffy or retracted eyelids Reddened or inflamed eyes Light sensitivity Double vision Vision loss Graves' dermopathy An uncommon manifestation of Graves' disease, called Graves' dermopathy, is the reddening and thickening of the skin, most often on your shins or the tops of your feet.	general
When to see a doctor A number of medical conditions can cause the signs and symptoms associated with Graves' disease.	general
See your doctor if you experience any potential problems related to Graves' disease to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis.	general
Seek emergency care if you're experiencing heart-related signs and symptoms, such as a rapid or irregular heartbeat, or if you develop vision loss.	general
More Information Graves' disease is caused by a malfunction in the body's disease-fighting immune system, although the exact reason why this happens is still unknown.	general
One normal immune system response is the production of antibodies designed to target a specific virus, bacterium or other foreign substance.	general
In Graves' disease ‚Äî for reasons that aren't well understood ‚Äî the body produces an antibody to one part of the cells in the thyroid gland, a hormone-producing gland in the neck.	general
Normally, thyroid function is regulated by a hormone released by a tiny gland at the base of the brain (pituitary gland).	general
The antibody associated with Graves' disease ‚Äî thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) ‚Äî acts like the regulatory pituitary hormone.	general
That means that TRAb overrides the normal regulation of the thyroid, causing an overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism).	general
Cause of Graves' ophthalmopathy This condition results from a buildup of certain carbohydrates in the muscles and tissues behind the eyes ‚Äî the cause of which also isn't known.	general
"It appears that the same antibody that can cause thyroid dysfunction may also have an ""attraction"" to tissues surrounding the eyes."	general
Graves' ophthalmopathy often appears at the same time as hyperthyroidism or several months later.	general
But signs and symptoms of ophthalmopathy may appear years before or after the onset of hyperthyroidism.	general
Graves' ophthalmopathy can also occur even if there's no hyperthyroidism.	general
Risk factors Although anyone can develop Graves' disease, a number of factors can increase the risk of disease.	general
These risk factors include the following: Because a family history of Graves' disease is a known risk factor, there is likely a gene or genes that can make a person more susceptible to the disorder.	general
Family history.	general
Women are much more likely to develop Graves' disease than are men.	general
Graves' disease usually develops in people younger than 40.	general
People with other disorders of the immune system, such as type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, have an increased risk.	general
Other autoimmune disorders.	general
Stressful life events or illness may act as a trigger for the onset of Graves' disease among people who are genetically susceptible.	general
Emotional or physical stress.	general
Pregnancy or recent childbirth may increase the risk of the disorder, particularly among women who are genetically susceptible.	general
Cigarette smoking, which can affect the immune system, increases the risk of Graves' disease.	general
Smokers who have Graves' disease are also at increased risk of developing Graves' ophthalmopathy.	general
Complications Possible complications of Graves' disease during pregnancy include miscarriage, preterm birth, fetal thyroid dysfunction, poor fetal growth, maternal heart failure and preeclampsia.	general
Preeclampsia is a maternal condition that results in high blood pressure and other serious signs and symptoms.	general
Pregnancy issues.	general
If left untreated, Graves' disease can lead to heart rhythm disorders, changes in the structure and function of the heart muscles, and the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to the body (congestive heart failure).	general
Heart disorders.	general
A rare, but life-threatening complication of Graves' disease is thyroid storm, also known as accelerated hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxic crisis.	general
It's more likely when severe hyperthyroidism is untreated or treated inadequately.	general
Thyroid storm.	general
The sudden and drastic increase in thyroid hormones can produce a number of effects, including fever, profuse sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, delirium, severe weakness, seizures, markedly irregular heartbeat, yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), severe low blood pressure, and coma.	general
Thyroid storm requires immediate emergency care.	general
Untreated hyperthyroidism also can lead to weak, brittle bones (osteoporosis).	general
The strength of your bones depends, in part, on the amount of calcium and other minerals they contain.	general
Too much thyroid hormone interferes with your body's ability to incorporate calcium into your bones.	general
Brittle bones.	general
Group B strep (streptococcus) is a common bacterium often carried in the intestines or lower genital tract.	general
The bacterium is usually harmless in healthy adults.	general
In newborns, however, it can cause a serious illness known as group B strep disease.	general
Group B strep can also cause dangerous infections in adults with certain chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes or liver disease.	general
Older adults are at increased risk of illness due to group B strep, too.	general
If you're a healthy adult, there's nothing you need to do about group B strep.	general
If you're pregnant, get a group B strep screening test during your third trimester.	general
If you have group B strep, antibiotic treatment during labor can protect your baby.	general
Most babies born to women carrying group B strep are healthy.	general
But the few who are infected by group B strep during labor can become critically ill.	general
In infants, illness caused by group B strep can be within six hours of birth (early onset) ‚Äî or weeks or months after birth (late onset).	general
Signs and symptoms might include: Difficulty breathing Irritability Many adults carry group B strep in their bodies, usually in the bowel, vagina, rectum, bladder or throat, and have no signs or symptoms.	general
In some cases, however, group B strep can cause a urinary tract infection or more-serious infections such as blood infections (bacteremia) or pneumonia.	general
When to see a doctor If you have signs or symptoms of group B strep infection ‚Äî particularly if you're pregnant, you have a chronic medical condition or you're older than 65 ‚Äî contact your doctor right away.	general
If you notice your infant has signs or symptoms of group B strep disease, contact your baby's doctor immediately.	general
Many healthy people carry group B strep bacteria in their bodies.	general
You might carry the bacteria in your body for a short time ‚Äî it can come and go ‚Äî or you might always have it.	general
Group B strep bacteria aren't sexually transmitted, and they're not spread through food or water.	general
How the bacteria are spread to anyone other than newborns isn't know.	general
Group B strep can spread to a baby during a vaginal delivery if the baby is exposed to ‚Äî or swallows ‚Äî fluids containing group B strep.	general
Risk factors An infant is at increased risk of developing group B strep disease if: The mother carries group B strep in her body The baby is born prematurely (earlier than 37 weeks) The mother's water breaks 18 hours or more before delivery The mother has an infection of the placental tissues and amniotic fluid (chorioamnionitis) The mother has a urinary tract infection during the pregnancy The mother's temperature is greater than 100.	general
4 F (38 C) during labor The mother previously delivered an infant with group B strep disease You're at increased risk of a group B strep infection if: You have a medical condition that impairs your immune system, such as diabetes, HIV infection, cancer or liver disease You're older than 65 Complications Group B strep infection can lead to life-threatening complications in infants, including: Inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) Infection in the bloodstream (bacteremia) If you're pregnant, group B strep can cause infection in the following areas: Urinary tract Bloodstream If you're an older adult or you have a chronic health condition, group B strep bacteria can cause complications such as: Skin infection Infection of the heart valves (endocarditis) Inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) To prevent group B bacteria from spreading to your baby during labor, your doctor can give you an IV antibiotic ‚Äî usually penicillin or a related drug ‚Äî when labor begins.	general
If you're allergic to penicillin and related drugs, you might receive cefazolin or clindamycin as an alternative.	general
Taking oral antibiotics ahead of time won't help because the bacteria can return before labor begins.	general
Antibiotic treatment during labor is also recommended if you: Have a urinary tract infection Delivered a previous baby with group B strep disease Develop a fever during labor Haven't delivered your baby within 18 hours of your water breaking Go into labor before 37 weeks and haven't been tested for group B strep If you tested positive for group B strep, remind your health care team during labor.	general
Vaccine in development Although it's not available yet, researchers are working on a group B strep vaccine that could help prevent group B strep infections in the future.	general
Growing pains are often described as an ache or throb in the legs ‚Äî often in the front of the thighs, the calves or behind the knees.	general
Growing pains tend to affect both legs and occur at night, and may even wake a child from sleep.	general
Although these pains are called growing pains, there's no evidence that growth hurts.	general
Growing pains may be linked to a lowered pain threshold or, in some cases, to psychological issues.	general
There's no specific treatment for growing pains.	general
You can make your child more comfortable by putting a warm heating pad on the sore muscles and massaging them.	general
Growing pains usually cause an aching or throbbing feeling in the legs.	general
This pain often occurs in the front of the thighs, the calves or behind the knees.	general
Usually both legs hurt.	general
Some children may also experience abdominal pain or headaches during episodes of growing pains.	general
The pain doesn't occur every day.	general
It comes and goes.	general
Growing pains often strike in the late afternoon or early evening and disappear by morning.	general
Sometimes the pain awakens a child in the middle of the night.	general
When to see a doctor Consult your child's doctor if you're concerned about your child's leg pain or the pain is: Severe enough to interfere with your child's normal activities Located in the joints Associated with an injury Accompanied by other signs or symptoms, such as swelling, redness, tenderness, fever, limping, rash, loss of appetite, weakness or fatigue The cause of growing pains is unknown.	general
But there's no evidence that a child's growth is painful.	general
Growing pains don't usually happen where growth is occurring or during times of rapid growth.	general
It's been suggested that growing pains may be linked to restless legs syndrome.	general
But muscle pain at night from overuse during the day is thought to be the most likely cause of growing pains.	general
Overuse from activities such as running, climbing and jumping can be hard on a child's musculoskeletal system.	general
Risk factors Growing pains are common in preschool and school-age children.	general
They're slightly more common in girls than in boys.	general
Running, climbing or jumping during the day might increase the risk of leg pain at night.	general
Periodontitis Periodontitis Periodontitis is a severe gum infection that can lead to tooth loss and other serious health complications.	general
Periodontitis (per-e-o-don-TIE-tis) is a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue and destroys the bone that supports your teeth.	general
Periodontitis can cause teeth to loosen or lead to tooth loss.	general
Periodontitis is common but largely preventable.	general
It's usually the result of poor oral hygiene.	general
Brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups can greatly improve your chances of successful treatment for periodontitis and can also reduce your chance of developing it.	general
Healthy gums are firm and pale pink and fit snuggly around teeth.	general
Signs and symptoms of periodontitis can include: Swollen or puffy gums Gums that feel tender when touched Gums that bleed easily Gums that pull away from your teeth (recede), making your teeth look longer than normal New spaces developing between your teeth Pus between your teeth and gums Loose teeth Painful chewing A change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite There are several different types of periodontitis.	general
The more common types include those below.	general
is the most common type, affecting mostly adults, though children can be affected, too.	general
This type is caused by plaque buildup and involves slow deterioration that may improve and get worse over time but causes destruction in the gums and bone and loss of teeth if not treated.	general
Chronic periodontitis usually begins in childhood or early adulthood and affects only a small number of people.	general
It tends to affect families and causes rapid progression of bone and tooth loss if untreated.	general
Aggressive periodontitis is characterized by the death of gum tissue, tooth ligaments and supporting bone caused by lack of blood supply (necrosis), resulting in severe infection.	general
This type generally occurs in people with a suppressed immune system ‚Äî such as from HIV infection, cancer treatment or other causes ‚Äî and malnutrition.	general
Necrotizing periodontal disease When to see a dentist Follow your dentist's recommended schedule for regular checkups.	general
If you notice any symptoms of periodontitis, make an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible.	general
The sooner you seek care, the better your chances of reversing damage from periodontitis.	general
In most cases, periodontitis begins with plaque ‚Äî a sticky film composed mainly of bacteria.	general
If left untreated, here's how plaque can eventually advance to periodontitis: when starches and sugars in food interact with bacteria normally found in your mouth.	general
Brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day removes plaque, but plaque re-forms quickly.	general
Plaque forms on your teeth if it stays on your teeth.	general
Tartar is more difficult to remove and it's filled with bacteria.	general
The longer plaque and tartar remain on your teeth, the more damage they can do.	general
You can't get rid of tartar by brushing and flossing ‚Äî you need a professional dental cleaning to remove it.	general
Plaque can harden under your gumline into tartar (calculus) the mildest form of periodontal disease.	general
Gingivitis is irritation and inflammation of the part of your gum around the base of your teeth (gingiva).	general
Gingivitis can be reversed with professional treatment and good home oral care.	general
Plaque can cause gingivitis, eventually causing pockets to develop between your gums and teeth that fill with plaque, tartar and bacteria.	general
In time, these pockets become deeper, filling with more bacteria.	general
If not treated, these deep infections cause a loss of tissue and bone, and ultimately you may lose one or more teeth.	general
Also, ongoing chronic inflammation can put a strain on your immune system.	general
Ongoing gum inflammation can cause periodontitis, Risk factors Hormonal changes, such as those related to pregnancy or menopause Substance abuse Certain medications that cause dry mouth or gum changes Conditions that cause decreased immunity, such as leukemia, HIV/AIDS and cancer treatment Certain diseases, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease Complications Periodontitis can cause tooth loss.	general
And some research suggests that the bacteria responsible for periodontitis can enter your bloodstream through gum tissue, possibly affecting your heart, lungs and other parts of your body.	general
For example, periodontitis may be linked with respiratory disease, rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease or stroke.	general
But more studies are needed to confirm a link.	general
The best way to prevent periodontitis is to follow a program of good oral hygiene, one that you begin early and practice consistently throughout life.	general
That means brushing your teeth for two minutes at least twice daily ‚Äî in the morning and before going to bed ‚Äî and flossing at least once a day.	general
Flossing before you brush allows you to clean away the loosened food particles and bacteria.	general
Good oral hygiene.	general
See your dentist or dental hygienist regularly for cleanings, usually every six to 12 months.	general
If you have risk factors that increase your chance of developing periodontitis ‚Äî such as having dry mouth, taking certain medications or smoking ‚Äî you may need professional cleaning more often.	general
Regular dental visits.	general
Trichotillomania (trik-o-til-o-MAY-nee-uh), also called hair-pulling disorder, is a mental disorder that involves recurrent, irresistible urges to pull out hair from your scalp, eyebrows or other areas of your body, despite trying to stop.	general
Hair pulling from the scalp often leaves patchy bald spots, which causes significant distress and can interfere with social or work functioning.	general
People with trichotillomania may go to great lengths to disguise the loss of hair.	general
For some people, trichotillomania may be mild and generally manageable.	general
For others, the compulsive urge to pull hair is overwhelming.	general
Some treatment options have helped many people reduce their hair pulling or stop entirely.	general
Signs and symptoms of trichotillomania often include: Repeatedly pulling your hair out, typically from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas, and sites may vary over time An increasing sense of tension before pulling, or when you try to resist pulling A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled Noticeable hair loss, such as shortened hair or thinned or bald areas on the scalp or other areas of your body, including sparse or missing eyelashes or eyebrows Preference for specific types of hair, rituals that accompany hair pulling or patterns of hair pulling Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success Significant distress or problems at work, school or in social situations related to pulling out your hair Many people who have trichotillomania also pick their skin, bite their nails or chew their lips.	general
Sometimes pulling hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign.	general
Most people with trichotillomania pull hair in private and generally try to hide the disorder from others.	general
For people with trichotillomania, hair pulling can be: Some people pull their hair intentionally to relieve tension or distress ‚Äî for example, pulling hair out to get relief from the overwhelming urge to pull hair.	general
Some people may develop elaborate rituals for pulling hair, such as finding just the right hair or biting pulled hairs.	general
Some people pull their hair without even realizing they're doing it, such as when they're bored, reading or watching TV.	general
The same person may do both focused and automatic hair pulling, depending on the situation and mood.	general
Certain positions or rituals may trigger hair pulling, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair.	general
Trichotillomania can be related to emotions: For many people with trichotillomania, hair pulling is a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, fatigue or frustration.	general
Negative emotions.	general
People with trichotillomania often find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides a measure of relief.	general
As a result, they continue to pull their hair to maintain these positive feelings.	general
Positive feelings.	general
Trichotillomania is a long-term (chronic) disorder.	general
Without treatment, symptoms can vary in severity over time.	general
For example, the hormonal changes of menstruation can worsen symptoms in women.	general
For some people, if not treated, symptoms can come and go for weeks, months or years at a time.	general
Rarely, hair pulling ends within a few years of starting.	general
When to see a doctor If you can't stop pulling out your hair or you feel embarrassed or ashamed by your appearance as a result of your hair pulling, talk to your doctor.	general
Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it's a mental health disorder, and it's unlikely to get better without treatment.	general
The cause of trichotillomania is unclear.	general
But like many complex disorders, trichotillomania probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.	general
Risk factors These factors tend to increase the risk of trichotillomania: Genetics may play a role in the development of trichotillomania, and the disorder may occur in those who have a close relative with the disorder.	general
Family history.	general
Trichotillomania usually develops just before or during the early teens ‚Äî most often between the ages of 10 and 13 years ‚Äî and it's often a lifelong problem.	general
Infants also can be prone to hair pulling, but this is usually mild and goes away on its own without treatment.	general
People who have trichotillomania may also have other disorders, such as depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	general
Other disorders.	general
Severely stressful situations or events may trigger trichotillomania in some people.	general
Although far more women than men are treated for trichotillomania, this may be because women are more likely to seek medical advice.	general
In early childhood, boys and girls appear to be equally affected.	general
Complications Although it may not seem particularly serious, trichotillomania can have a major negative impact on your life.	general
Complications may include: Many people with trichotillomania report feeling shame, humiliation and embarrassment.	general
They may experience low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and alcohol or street drug use because of their condition.	general
Emotional distress.	general
Embarrassment because of hair loss may lead you to avoid social activities and job opportunities.	general
People with trichotillomania may wear wigs, style their hair to disguise bald patches or wear false eyelashes.	general
Some people may avoid intimacy for fear that their condition will be discovered.	general
Problems with social and work functioning.	general
Constant hair pulling can cause scarring and other damage, including infections, to the skin on your scalp or the specific area where hair is pulled and can permanently affect hair growth.	general
Skin and hair damage.	general
Eating your hair may lead to a large, matted hairball (trichobezoar) in your digestive tract.	general
Over a period of years, the hairball can cause weight loss, vomiting, intestinal obstruction and even death.	general
A hammertoe is curled due to a bend in the middle joint of the toe.	general
Hammertoe and mallet toe are foot deformities that occur due to an imbalance in the muscles, tendons or ligaments that normally hold the toe straight.	general
The type of shoes you wear, foot structure, trauma and certain disease processes can contribute to the development of these deformities.	general
A hammertoe has an abnormal bend in the middle joint of a toe.	general
Mallet toe affects the joint nearest the toenail.	general
Hammertoe and mallet toe usually occur in your second, third and fourth toes.	general
Relieving the pain and pressure of hammertoe and mallet toe may involve changing your footwear and wearing shoe inserts.	general
If you have a more severe case of hammertoe or mallet toe, you might need surgery to get relief.	general
Hammertoe and mallet toe feature an abnormal bend in the joints of one or more of your toes.	general
Moving the affected toe may be difficult or painful.	general
Corns and calluses can result from the toe rubbing against the inside of your shoes.	general
Hammertoe and mallet toe have been linked to: High-heeled shoes or footwear that's too tight in the toe box can crowd your toes into a space in which they can't lie flat.	general
This curled toe position might eventually persist even when you're barefoot.	general
Certain shoes.	general
An injury in which you stub, jam or break a toe can make it more likely for that digit to develop hammertoe or mallet toe.	general
The imbalance leads to instability, which can cause the toe to contract.	general
Abnormal balance of the toe muscles.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase you risk of hammertoe and mallet toe include: The risk of hammertoe and mallet toe increases with age.	general
Women are much more likely to develop hammertoe or mallet toe than are men.	general
If your second toe is longer than your big toe, it's at higher risk of hammertoe or mallet toe.	general
Toe length.	general
Arthritis and diabetes might make you more prone to developing foot deformities.	general
Heredity might also play a role.	general
Certain diseases.	general
Complications At first, a hammertoe or mallet toe might maintain its flexibility.	general
But eventually, the tendons of the toe can contract and tighten, causing your toe to become permanently bent.	general
Your shoes can rub against the raised portion of the toe or toes, causing painful corns or calluses.	general
You can avoid many foot, heel and ankle problems with shoes that fit properly.	general
Here's what to look for when buying shoes: Avoid shoes with pointed toes.	general
Adequate toe room.	general
Avoiding high heels will help you avoid back problems.	general
Laced or strapped shoes are roomier and adjustable.	general
Adjustability.	general
These additional tips can help you buy the right shoes: Your feet swell throughout the day.	general
Buy shoes at the end of the day.	general
As you age, your shoe size might change ‚Äî especially the width.	general
Measure both feet and buy for the larger foot.	general
Check your size.	general
Be sure shoes are comfortable before you buy them.	general
If necessary, a shoe repair store might be able to stretch shoes in tight spots, but it's better to buy them to fit.	general
Buy shoes that fit.	general
A hamstring injury occurs when you strain or pull one of your hamstring muscles ‚Äî the group of three muscles that run along the back of your thigh.	general
You may be more likely to get a hamstring injury if you play soccer, basketball, football, tennis or a similar sport that involves sprinting with sudden stops and starts.	general
Hamstring injury can occur in runners and in dancers as well.	general
Self-care measures such as rest, ice and over-the-counter pain medications are often all you need to relieve the pain and swelling associated with a hamstring injury.	general
Rarely, surgery may be needed to repair a hamstring muscle or tendon.	general
A hamstring injury typically causes a sudden, sharp pain in the back of your thigh.	general
"You might also feel a ""popping"" or tearing sensation."	general
Swelling and tenderness usually develop within a few hours.	general
You may also experience bruising or discoloration along the back of your leg, as well as muscle weakness or an inability to put weight on your injured leg.	general
When to see a doctor Mild hamstring strains can be treated at home.	general
But you should see a doctor if you can't bear any weight on your injured leg or if you can't walk more than four steps without significant pain.	general
The hamstring muscles are a group of three muscles that run along the back of your thigh from your hip to just below your knee.	general
These muscles make it possible to extend your leg straight behind your body and to bend your knee.	general
When any one of these muscles stretches beyond its limit during physical activity, injury can result.	general
Risk factors Hamstring injury risk factors include: Sports that require sprinting or running, or other activities such as dancing that might require extreme stretching, make a hamstring injury more likely.	general
Sports participation.	general
After you've had one hamstring injury, you're more likely to have another one, especially if you try to resume all your activities at pre-injury levels of intensity before your muscles have time to heal and rebuild strength.	general
Prior hamstring injury.	general
If you have poor flexibility, your muscles may not be able to bear the full force of the action required during certain activities.	general
Poor flexibility.	general
Although not all experts agree, some suggest that a muscle imbalance may lead to hamstring injury.	general
When the muscles along the front of your thigh ‚Äî the quadriceps ‚Äî become stronger and more developed than your hamstring muscles, you may be more likely to injure your hamstring muscles.	general
Muscle imbalance.	general
Complications Returning to strenuous activities before your hamstring muscles are completely healed might cause an injury recurrence.	general
As part of an overall physical conditioning program, regular stretching and strengthening exercises can help minimize your risk of hamstring injury.	general
Try to be in shape to play your sport; don't play your sport to get in shape.	general
If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries.	general
Ask your doctor about appropriate conditioning exercises.	general
Wrist pain is often caused by sprains or fractures from sudden injuries.	general
But wrist pain can also result from long-term problems, such as repetitive stress, arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.	general
Because so many factors can lead to wrist pain, diagnosing the exact cause can be difficult, but an accurate diagnosis is essential for proper treatment and healing.	general
Products & Services Wrist pain may vary, depending on the cause.	general
For example, osteoarthritis pain is often described as being similar to a dull toothache, while carpal tunnel syndrome usually causes a pins-and-needles feeling or a tingling sensation, especially at night.	general
The precise location of your wrist pain also provides clues to what's behind your symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor Not all wrist pain requires medical care.	general
Minor sprains and strains usually respond to ice, rest and over-the-counter pain medications.	general
But if pain and swelling last longer than a few days or become worse, see your doctor.	general
Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to poor healing, reduced range of motion and long-term disability.	general
Damage to any of the parts of your wrist can cause pain and affect your ability to use your wrist and hand.	general
Wrist injuries often occur when you fall forward onto your outstretched hand.	general
This can cause sprains, strains and even fractures.	general
A scaphoid fracture involves a bone on the thumb side of the wrist.	general
This type of fracture may not show up on X-rays immediately after the injury.	general
Sudden impacts.	general
Any activity that involves repetitive wrist motion ‚Äî from hitting a tennis ball or bowing a cello to driving cross-country ‚Äî can inflame the tissues around joints or cause stress fractures, especially when you perform the movement for hours on end without a break.	general
De Quervain's disease is a repetitive stress injury that causes pain at the base of the thumb.	general
Repetitive stress.	general
This type of arthritis occurs when the cartilage that cushions the ends of your bones deteriorates over time.	general
Osteoarthritis in the wrist is uncommon and usually occurs only in people who have injured that wrist in the past.	general
Osteoarthritis.	general
A disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, rheumatoid arthritis commonly involves the wrist.	general
If one wrist is affected, the other one usually is, too.	general
Rheumatoid arthritis.	general
Other diseases and conditions Wrist bones Wrist bones Your wrist is made up of eight small bones (carpal bones) plus two long bones in your forearm ‚Äî the radius and the ulna.	general
The most commonly injured carpal bone is the scaphoid bone, located near the base of your thumb.	general
Carpal tunnel syndrome develops when there's increased pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel, a passageway in the palm side of your wrist.	general
Carpal tunnel syndrome.	general
These soft tissue cysts occur most often on the part of your wrist opposite your palm.	general
Ganglion cysts may be painful, and pain may either worsen or improve with activity.	general
Ganglion cysts.	general
This disorder typically affects young adults and involves the progressive collapse of one of the small bones in the wrist.	general
Kienbock's disease occurs when the blood supply to this bone is compromised.	general
Kienbock's disease.	general
Risk factors Wrist pain can happen to anyone ‚Äî whether you're very sedentary, very active or somewhere in between.	general
But your risk may be increased by: Wrist injuries are common in many sports, both those that involve impact and those that involve repetitive stress on the wrist.	general
These can include football, bowling, golf, gymnastics, snowboarding and tennis.	general
Sports participation.	general
Almost any activity that involves your hands and wrists ‚Äî even knitting and cutting hair ‚Äî if performed forcefully enough and often enough can lead to disabling wrist pain.	general
Repetitive work.	general
Pregnancy, diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis and gout may increase your risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.	general
Certain diseases or conditions.	general
It's impossible to prevent the unforeseen events that often cause wrist injuries, but these basic tips may offer some protection: Getting adequate amounts of calcium ‚Äî 1,000 milligrams a day for most adults and at least 1,200 milligrams a day for women over age 50, ‚Äî can help prevent fractures.	general
Build bone strength.	general
Falling forward onto an outstretched hand is the main cause of most wrist injuries.	general
To help prevent falls, wear sensible shoes.	general
Remove home hazards.	general
Light up your living space.	general
And install grab bars in your bathroom and handrails on your stairways, if necessary.	general
Prevent falls.	general
Wear wrist guards for high-risk activities, such as football, snowboarding and rollerblading.	general
Use protective gear for athletic activities.	general
If you spend long periods at a keyboard, take regular breaks.	general
When you type, keep your wrist in a relaxed, neutral position.	general
An ergonomic keyboard and foam or gel wrist support may help.	general
Pay attention to ergonomics.	general
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease ‚Äî a mild, contagious viral infection common in young children ‚Äî is characterized by sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet.	general
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is most commonly caused by a coxsackievirus.	general
There's no specific treatment for hand-foot-and-mouth disease.	general
Frequent hand-washing and avoiding close contact with people who are infected with hand-foot-and-mouth disease may help reduce your child's risk of infection.	general
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease often causes a rash of painful, red, blister-like lesions on the palms of the hands.	general
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease on the foot Hand-foot-and-mouth disease on the foot Hand-foot-and-mouth disease often causes a rash of painful, red, blister-like lesions on the soles of the feet.	general
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease may cause all of the following signs and symptoms or just some of them.	general
They include: Feeling of being unwell (malaise) Painful, red, blister-like lesions on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks A red rash, without itching but sometimes with blistering, on the palms, soles and sometimes the buttocks Irritability in infants and toddlers Loss of appetite The usual period from initial infection to the onset of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is three to six days.	general
A fever is often the first sign of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, followed by a sore throat and sometimes a poor appetite and malaise.	general
One or two days after the fever begins, painful sores may develop in the front of the mouth or throat.	general
A rash on the hands and feet and possibly on the buttocks can follow within one or two days.	general
Sores that develop in the back of the mouth and throat may suggest that your child is infected with a related viral illness called herpangina.	general
Other distinguishing features of herpangina include a sudden high fever and in some instances, seizure.	general
Sores that develop on the hands, feet or other parts of the body are very rare.	general
When to see a doctor Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is usually a minor illness causing only a few days of fever and relatively mild signs and symptoms.	general
Contact your doctor if mouth sores or a sore throat keep your child from drinking fluids.	general
And contact your doctor if after a few days, your child's signs and symptoms worsen.	general
The most common cause of hand-foot-and-mouth disease is infection with the coxsackievirus A16.	general
The coxsackievirus belongs to a group of viruses called nonpolio enteroviruses.	general
Other types of enteroviruses sometimes cause hand-foot-and-mouth disease.	general
Oral ingestion is the main source of coxsackievirus infection and hand-foot-and-mouth disease.	general
The illness spreads by person-to-person contact with an infected person's: Nasal secretions or throat discharge Respiratory droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or sneeze Common in child care setting Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is most common in children in child care settings because of frequent diaper changes and potty training, and because little children often put their hands in their mouths.	general
Although your child is most contagious with hand-foot-and-mouth disease during the first week of the illness, the virus can remain in his or her body for weeks after the signs and symptoms are gone.	general
That means your child still can infect others.	general
Some people, particularly adults, can pass the virus without showing any signs or symptoms of the disease.	general
Outbreaks of the disease are more common in summer and autumn in the United States and other temperate climates.	general
In tropical climates, outbreaks occur year-round.	general
Different from foot-and-mouth disease Hand-foot-and-mouth disease isn't related to foot-and-mouth disease (sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease), which is an infectious viral disease found in farm animals.	general
You can't contract hand-foot-and-mouth disease from pets or other animals, and you can't transmit it to them.	general
Risk factors Hand-foot-and-mouth disease primarily affects children younger than age 10, often those under 5 years.	general
Children in child care centers are especially susceptible to outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease because the infection spreads by person-to-person contact, and young children are the most susceptible.	general
Children usually develop immunity to hand-foot-and-mouth disease as they get older by building antibodies after exposure to the virus that causes the disease.	general
However, it's possible for adolescents and adults to get the disease.	general
Complications The most common complication of hand-foot-and-mouth disease is dehydration.	general
The illness can cause sores in the mouth and throat, making swallowing painful and difficult.	general
Watch closely to make sure your child frequently sips fluid during the course of the illness.	general
If dehydration is severe, intravenous (IV) fluids may be necessary.	general
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is usually a minor illness causing only a few days of fever and relatively mild signs and symptoms.	general
A rare and sometimes serious form of the coxsackievirus can involve the brain and cause other complications: This is a rare infection and inflammation of the membranes (meninges) and cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.	general
Viral meningitis.	general
This severe and potentially life-threatening disease involves brain inflammation caused by a virus.	general
Encephalitis is rare.	general
Encephalitis.	general
Certain precautions can help to reduce the risk of infection with hand-foot-and-mouth disease: Be sure to wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper and before preparing food and eating.	general
When soap and water aren't available, use hand wipes or gels treated with germ-killing alcohol.	general
Wash hands carefully.	general
Get in the habit of cleaning high-traffic areas and surfaces first with soap and water, then with a diluted solution of chlorine bleach and water.	general
Child care centers should follow a strict schedule of cleaning and disinfecting all common areas, including shared items such as toys, as the virus can live on these objects for days.	general
Clean your baby's pacifiers often.	general
Disinfect common areas.	general
Show your children how to practice good hygiene and how to keep themselves clean.	general
Explain to them why it's best not to put their fingers, hands or any other objects in their mouths.	general
Teach good hygiene.	general
Because hand-foot-and-mouth disease is highly contagious, people with the illness should limit their exposure to others while they have active signs and symptoms.	general
Keep children with hand-foot-and-mouth disease out of child care or school until fever is gone and mouth sores have healed.	general
If you have the illness, stay home from work.	general
Isolate contagious people.	general
A hangover is a group of unpleasant signs and symptoms that can develop after drinking too much alcohol.	general
As if feeling awful weren't bad enough, frequent hangovers are also associated with poor performance and conflict at work.	general
As a general rule, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to have a hangover the next day.	general
But there's no magic formula to tell you how much you can safely drink and still avoid a hangover.	general
However unpleasant, most hangovers go away on their own, though they can last up to 24 hours.	general
If you choose to drink alcohol, doing so responsibly can help you avoid future hangovers.	general
Hangover symptoms typically begin when your blood alcohol content drops significantly and is at or near zero.	general
They're usually in full effect the morning after a night of heavy drinking.	general
Depending on what and how much you drank, you may notice: Fatigue and weakness Headaches and muscle aches Poor or decreased sleep Dizziness or a sense of the room spinning Rapid heartbeat When to see a doctor Hangovers after a single night's drinking go away on their own.	general
Talk with your doctor if you're concerned that frequent, heavy drinking may lead to serious alcohol withdrawal, or when regular hangovers affect your quality of life, including your personal relationships or your performance at work.	general
Treatment for alcohol problems is widely available.	general
When it's an emergency More-severe signs and symptoms that accompany heavy drinking may indicate alcohol poisoning ‚Äî a life-threatening emergency.	general
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a person who has been drinking shows signs of: Slow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute) Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths) Blue-tinged skin or pale skin Low body temperature (hypothermia) Passing out (unconsciousness) and can't be awakened A person who is unconscious or can't be awakened is at risk of dying.	general
If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning ‚Äî even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms ‚Äî seek immediate medical care.	general
Hangovers are caused by drinking too much alcohol.	general
A single alcoholic drink is enough to trigger a hangover for some people, while others may drink heavily and escape a hangover entirely.	general
Various factors may contribute to a hangover.	general
For example: In turn, urinating more than usual can lead to dehydration ‚Äî often indicated by thirst, dizziness and lightheadedness.	general
Alcohol causes your body to produce more urine.	general
Your immune system may trigger certain agents that commonly produce physical symptoms, such as an inability to concentrate, memory problems, decreased appetite and loss of interest in usual activities.	general
Alcohol triggers an inflammatory response from your immune system.	general
Alcohol increases the production of stomach acid and delays stomach emptying.	general
Any of these factors can cause abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.	general
Alcohol irritates the lining of your stomach.	general
If your blood sugar dips too low, you may experience fatigue, weakness, shakiness, mood disturbances and even seizures.	general
Alcohol can cause your blood sugar to fall.	general
which can lead to headaches.	general
Alcohol causes your blood vessels to expand, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often causes awakening in the middle of the night.	general
This may leave you groggy and tired.	general
Alcohol can make you sleepy, Alcoholic beverages contain ingredients called congeners, which give many types of alcoholic beverages their flavor and can contribute to hangovers.	general
Congeners are found in larger amounts in dark liquors, such as brandy and bourbon, than in clear liquors, such as vodka and gin.	general
Congeners are more likely to produce a hangover or increase the severity of a hangover.	general
But drinking too much alcohol of any color can still make you feel bad the next morning.	general
Risk factors Anyone who drinks alcohol can experience a hangover, but some people are more susceptible to hangovers than others are.	general
A genetic variation that affects the way alcohol is metabolized may make some people flush, sweat or become ill after drinking even a small amount of alcohol.	general
Factors that may make a hangover more likely or severe include: Having no food in your stomach speeds the body's absorption of alcohol.	general
Drinking on an empty stomach.	general
Smoking combined with drinking appears to increase the likelihood of next-day misery.	general
Using other drugs, such as nicotine, along with alcohol.	general
Some researchers believe that some hangover symptoms are often due, at least in part, to the poor-quality and short sleep cycle that typically follows a night of drinking.	general
Not sleeping well or long enough after drinking.	general
Having close relatives with a history of alcoholism may suggest an inherited problem with the way your body processes alcohol.	general
Having a family history of alcoholism.	general
Darker colored drinks often contain a high volume of congeners and may be more likely to produce a hangover.	general
Drinking darker colored alcoholic beverages.	general
Complications When you have a hangover, you're likely to experience problems with: Concentration Not surprisingly, this temporary dulling of your abilities increases your risk of a number of problems at school or work, such as: Absenteeism Workplace injuries Despite various over-the-counter pills and tablets that claim to prevent hangovers, the only guaranteed way to prevent a hangover is to avoid alcohol.	general
If you choose to drink, do so in moderation.	general
Moderate alcohol use for healthy adults means up to one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.	general
The less alcohol you drink, the less likely you are to have a hangover.	general
It may help to: As alcohol is absorbed more quickly if your stomach is empty, it may help to eat something before drinking alcohol and during the time you're drinking.	general
Eat before and while drinking.	general
Beverages with fewer congeners are slightly less likely to cause hangovers than beverages with more congeners, but remember that all types of alcohol can result in a hangover.	general
Choose carefully.	general
Drinking a full glass of water after each alcoholic drink will help you stay hydrated.	general
It'll also help you drink less alcohol.	general
Sip water between drinks.	general
Decide ahead of time how many drinks you'll have ‚Äî and stick to it.	general
Don't feel pressured to drink.	general
Know your limits and only drink in moderation.	general
Avoid having more than one alcoholic drink in an hour.	general
Stop drinking completely when you've reached your limit (or before then).	general
Take it slow.	general
Some people take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), to prevent hangover symptoms.	general
But ask your doctor if this is safe for you and what dosage is best for you.	general
These medications may interact with other medications, and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) may cause liver damage if too much alcohol is consumed.	general
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is an infectious disease characterized by flu-like symptoms that can progress rapidly to potentially life-threatening breathing problems.	general
Several types of hantaviruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.	general
They are carried by several types of rodents, particularly the deer mouse.	general
You become infected primarily by breathing air infected with hantaviruses that are shed in rodent urine and droppings.	general
Because treatment options are limited, the best protection against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is to avoid rodents and their habitats.	general
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome advances through two distinct stages.	general
In the first stage, you may experience flu-like signs and symptoms that may include: Fever and chills Vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain In its early stages, hantavirus infection is difficult to distinguish from influenza, pneumonia or other viral conditions.	general
After four to 10 days, more-serious signs and symptoms begin.	general
They typically include: A cough that produces secretions Shortness of breath Low blood pressure Reduced heart efficiency When to see a doctor The signs and symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can worsen suddenly and may quickly become life-threatening.	general
If you've been around rodents or rodent droppings and have signs and symptoms of fever, chills, muscle aches or any difficulties breathing, seek immediate medical attention.	general
Each type of hantavirus has a preferred rodent carrier.	general
The deer mouse is the primary carrier of the virus responsible for most cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America.	general
Other hantavirus carriers include the white-tailed mouse, cotton rat and rice rat.	general
Inhalation: Main route of transmission Hantaviruses are transmitted to people primarily through the aerosolization of viruses shed in infected rodents' droppings, urine or saliva.	general
Aerosolization occurs when a virus is kicked up into the air, making it easy for you to inhale.	general
For example, a broom used to clean up mouse droppings in an attic may nudge into the air tiny particles of feces containing hantaviruses, which you can then easily inhale.	general
After you inhale hantaviruses, they reach your lungs and begin to invade tiny blood vessels called capillaries, eventually causing them to leak.	general
Your lungs then flood with fluid, which can trigger any of the respiratory problems associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.	general
Person-to-person transmission People who become infected with the North American strain of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome aren't contagious to other people.	general
However, certain outbreaks in South America have shown evidence of being transmitted from person to person, which illustrates variation across strains in different regions.	general
Risk factors Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is most common in rural areas of the western United States during the spring and summer months.	general
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome also occurs in South America and Canada.	general
Other hantaviruses occur in Asia, where they cause kidney disorders rather than lung problems.	general
The chance of developing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is greater for people who work, live or play in spaces where rodents live.	general
Factors and activities that increase the risk include: Opening and cleaning long unused buildings or sheds Housecleaning, particularly in attics or other low-traffic areas Having a home or workspace infested with rodents Having a job that involves exposure to rodents, such as construction, utility work and pest control Camping, hiking or hunting Complications Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can quickly become life-threatening.	general
As the lungs fill with fluid, breathing becomes more and more difficult.	general
Blood pressure drops and organs begin to fail, particularly the heart.	general
Depending on the hantavirus strain, the mortality rate for the North American variety of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can be more than 30%.	general
Keeping rodents out of your home and workplace can help reduce your risk of hantavirus infection.	general
Try these tips: Mice can squeeze through holes as small as 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) wide.	general
Seal holes with wire screening, metal flashing or cement.	general
Block access.	general
Wash dishes promptly, clean counters and floors, and store your food ‚Äî including pet food ‚Äî in rodent-proof containers.	general
Use tightfitting lids on garbage cans.	general
Close the food buffet.	general
Clear brush, grass and junk away from the building's foundation.	general
Reduce nesting material.	general
Spring-loaded traps should be set along baseboards.	general
Exercise caution while using poison-bait traps, as the poison also can harm people and pets.	general
Safe cleanup procedures Wet down dead rodents and areas where rodents have been with alcohol, household disinfectants or bleach.	general
This kills the virus and helps prevent infected dust from being stirred up into the air.	general
Once everything is wet, use a damp towel to pick up the contaminated material.	general
Then mop or sponge the area with disinfectant.	general
Take special precautions, such as wearing a respirator, when cleaning buildings with heavy rodent infestations.	general
Head and neck cancers are a broad category of cancers that occur in the head and neck region.	general
Head and neck cancer treatment depends on the type, location and size of your cancer.	general
Treatment for head and neck cancers often involves surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.	general
Treatments may be combined.	general
After treatment, recovery from head and neck cancers may involve working with rehabilitation specialists and other experts to cope with side effects, such as hearing loss, difficulty eating, dental problems, thyroid issues, difficulty breathing or difficulty speaking.	general
Head lice feed on blood from the scalp.	general
The female louse lays eggs (nits) that stick to hair shafts.	general
Head lice are tiny insects that feed on blood from the human scalp.	general
An infestation of head lice, called pediculosis capitis, most often affects children and usually results from the direct transfer of lice from the hair of one person to the hair of another.	general
A head lice infestation isn't a sign of poor personal hygiene or an unclean living environment.	general
Head lice don't carry bacterial or viral infectious diseases.	general
Over-the-counter and prescription medications are available to treat head lice.	general
Following treatment instructions carefully is important for ridding your scalp and hair of lice and their eggs.	general
A number of home or natural remedies are used to treat head lice infestations, but there is little to no clinical evidence of their effectiveness.	general
You may not be aware of a lice infestation.	general
However, common signs and symptoms can include: Itching on the scalp, neck and ears is the most common symptom.	general
This is an allergic reaction to louse saliva.	general
When a person has an infestation for the first time, itching may not occur for two to six weeks after infestation.	general
Lice may be visible but are difficult to spot because they're small, avoid light and move quickly.	general
Lice on scalp.	general
Nits stick to hair shafts.	general
Incubating nits may be difficult to see because they're very tiny.	general
They're easiest to spot around the ears and the hairline of the neck.	general
Empty nits may be easier to spot because they're lighter in color and further from the scalp.	general
However, the presence of nits doesn't necessarily indicate an active infestation.	general
Lice eggs (nits) on hair shafts.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor before you begin treatment if you suspect that you or your child has a head lice infestation.	general
Studies show that many children have been treated for head lice with over-the-counter medications or home remedies when they don't have an active head lice infestation.	general
Things often mistaken for nits include: Dead or empty nits from a previous head lice infestation Residue from hair products Bead of dead hair tissue on a hair shaft (hair cast) Scab tissue, dirt or other debris Other small insects found in the hair A head louse is a tan or grayish insect about the size of a strawberry seed.	general
It feeds on human blood that it extracts from the scalp.	general
The female louse produces a sticky substance that adheres each egg to a hair shaft.	general
An egg is attached approximately 3/16 inch (4 millimeters) from the base of the shaft ‚Äî an environment that provides an ideal temperature for incubating the egg.	general
The louse life cycle A louse egg hatches after eight or nine days.	general
What emerges is an immature form of the louse called a nymph.	general
The nymph becomes a mature adult louse after nine to 12 days, and an adult lives for three to four weeks.	general
Transmission Head lice crawl, but they cannot jump or fly.	general
Most often transmission of a head louse from one person to another is by direct contact.	general
Therefore, transmission is most often within a family or among children who have close contact at school or play.	general
Indirect transmission is not likely, but lice may spread from one person to another by items such as: Hats and scarves Brushes and combs Indirect transfer could also occur among items of clothing stored together.	general
For example, hats or scarves hung on the same hook or stored in the same school locker could serve as vehicles for transmitting lice.	general
Household pets, such as dogs and cats, don't play a role in spreading head lice.	general
Risk factors Because head lice are spread primarily by head-to-head contact, the risk of transmission is greatest among younger people who play or go to school together.	general
In the United States, cases of head lice most often occur in children in preschool through middle school.	general
Complications If your child scratches an itchy scalp from a head lice infestation, it is possible for the skin to break and develop an infection.	general
It's difficult to prevent the spread of head lice among children in child care facilities and schools because there is so much close contact.	general
And the chance of indirect transmission from personal items is slight.	general
However, it is generally a good practice for children to hang their garments on a separate hook from other children's garments and not to share combs, brushes, hats and scarves.	general
A worry about head lice transmission is not considered a good reason to avoid sharing protective headgear for sports and bicycling when sharing is necessary.	general
Ice cream headaches are brief, stabbing headaches that can happen when you eat, drink or inhale something cold.	general
"Biting into an ice cream cone is a common trigger, but eating or drinking other frosty items, such as ice pops and slushy frozen drinks, can have the same ""brain-freeze"" effect."	general
Officially known as cold stimulus headaches, they can also occur when you suddenly expose your unprotected head to cold temperatures, such as by diving into cold water.	general
The good news: Most ice cream headaches are gone as quickly as they develop.	general
Products & Services Sharp, stabbing pain in the forehead Pain that peaks about 20 to 60 seconds after it begins and goes away in about the same time Pain that rarely lasts longer than five minutes When to see a doctor Because ice cream headaches quickly go away, there's no need to see a doctor.	general
Ice cream headaches are caused either by exposing your head to sudden, extreme cold or by having something cold move across the roof of your mouth and the back of your throat, such as when you eat ice cream quickly or gulp a cold drink.	general
Scientists are unsure about the exact mechanism that causes this pain.	general
One theory is that the cold temporarily alters blood flow in your nervous system, causing a brief headache.	general
Blood vessels constrict to prevent the loss of body heat and then relax again to let blood flow rise, resulting in a burst of pain that goes away once the body adapts to the temperature change.	general
Risk factors Ice cream headaches can affect anyone.	general
But you might be more susceptible to ice cream headaches or have more-severe ice cream headaches if you're prone to migraines.	general
The best way to avoid getting ice cream headaches is to avoid the cold food or drinks or exposure to cold that causes them.	general
A migraine can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head.	general
It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound.	general
Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that it interferes with your daily activities.	general
For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache.	general
An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.	general
Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful.	general
The right medicines, combined with self-help remedies and lifestyle changes, might help.	general
Products & Services Migraines, which often begin in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome.	general
Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages.	general
One or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including: Constipation Food cravings Neck stiffness For some people, aura might occur before or during migraines.	general
Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system.	general
They're usually visual, but can also include other disturbances.	general
Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and lasts for 20 to 60 minutes.	general
Examples of migraine aura include: Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light Vision loss Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body Difficulty speaking A migraine usually lasts from four to 72 hours if untreated.	general
How often migraines occur varies from person to person.	general
Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month.	general
During a migraine, you might have: Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides Pain that throbs or pulses Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch Nausea and vomiting After a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day.	general
Some people report feeling elated.	general
Sudden head movement might bring on the pain again briefly.	general
When to see a doctor Migraines are often undiagnosed and untreated.	general
If you regularly have signs and symptoms of migraine, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them.	general
Then make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your headaches.	general
Even if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different.	general
if you have any of the following signs and symptoms, which could indicate a more serious medical problem: See your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room An abrupt, severe headache like a thunderclap Headache with fever, stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness or trouble speaking Headache after a head injury, especially if the headache worsens A chronic headache that is worse after coughing, exertion, straining or a sudden movement New headache pain after age 50 More Information Though migraine causes aren't fully understood, genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role.	general
Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, might be involved.	general
So might imbalances in brain chemicals ‚Äî including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system.	general
Researchers are studying the role of serotonin in migraines.	general
Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).	general
Migraine triggers There are a number of migraine triggers, including: Fluctuations in estrogen, such as before or during menstrual periods, pregnancy and menopause, seem to trigger headaches in many women.	general
Hormonal changes in women.	general
Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, also can worsen migraines.	general
Some women, however, find their migraines occurring less often when taking these medications.	general
These include alcohol, especially wine, and too much caffeine, such as coffee.	general
Stress at work or home can cause migraines.	general
Bright lights and sun glare can induce migraines, as can loud sounds.	general
Strong smells ‚Äî including perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others ‚Äî trigger migraines in some people.	general
Sensory stimuli.	general
Missing sleep, getting too much sleep or jet lag can trigger migraines in some people.	general
Sleep changes.	general
Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, might provoke migraines.	general
Physical factors.	general
A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine.	general
Weather changes.	general
Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines.	general
Medications.	general
Aged cheeses and salty and processed foods might trigger migraines.	general
So might skipping meals or fasting.	general
These include the sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many foods.	general
Food additives.	general
More Information Several factors make you more prone to having migraines, including: If you have a family member with migraines, then you have a good chance of developing them too.	general
Family history.	general
Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence.	general
Migraines tend to peak during your 30s, and gradually become less severe and less frequent in the following decades.	general
Women are three times more likely to have migraines.	general
For women who have migraines, headaches might begin just before or shortly after onset of menstruation.	general
They might also change during pregnancy or menopause.	general
Migraines generally improve after menopause.	general
Hormonal changes.	general
Complications Taking combination painkillers, such as Excedrin Migraine for more than 10 days a month for three months or in higher doses can trigger serious medication-overuse headaches.	general
The same is true if you take aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) for more than 15 days a month or triptans, sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra) or rizatriptan (Maxalt), for more than nine days a month.	general
Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches.	general
You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle.	general
Sex headaches are brought on by sexual activity ‚Äî especially an orgasm.	general
You may notice a dull ache in your head and neck that builds up as sexual excitement increases.	general
Or, more commonly, you may experience a sudden, severe headache just before or during orgasm.	general
Most sex headaches are nothing to worry about.	general
But some can be a sign of something serious, such as problems with the blood vessels that feed your brain.	general
Products & Services There are two types of sex headaches: A dull ache in the head and neck that intensifies as sexual excitement increases A sudden, severe, throbbing headache that occurs just before or at the moment of orgasm In some people, both types of headaches are combined.	general
Most sex headaches last at least several minutes.	general
Others may linger for hours or even two to three days.	general
Many people who have sex headaches will experience them in clusters over a few months, and then they may go for a year or more without having any sex headaches.	general
Up to half of all people with sex headaches experience them over the course of about six months.	general
Some people may only have one attack during their lives.	general
When to see a doctor Sex headaches aren't usually a cause for concern.	general
But consult your doctor right away if you experience a headache during sexual activity ‚Äî especially if it begins abruptly or it's your first headache of this type.	general
Any type of sexual activity that leads to orgasm can trigger sex headaches.	general
Abrupt-onset and slow-to-build sex headaches can be primary headache disorders not associated with any underlying condition.	general
Sex headaches that come on suddenly are more likely to be associated with: A widening or bubble in the wall of an artery inside your head (intracranial aneurysm) An abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the brain (arteriovenous malformation) that bleeds into the spinal fluid-filled space in and around the brain Bleeding into the wall of an artery leading to the brain (dissection) Inflammation from certain infections Sex headaches associated with loss of consciousness, vomiting, stiff neck, other neurological symptoms and severe pain lasting more than 24 hours are more likely to be due to an underlying cause.	general
Risk factors Sex headaches can affect anyone.	general
But risk factors for these headaches include: Men are more prone to having sex headaches.	general
Being male.	general
Being prone to migraines increases your risk of sex headaches.	general
History of migraines.	general
Sometimes sex headaches can be prevented by stopping sexual activity before orgasm.	general
Taking a more passive role during sex also may help.	general
Sinus headaches are headaches that may feel like an infection in the sinuses (sinusitis).	general
You may feel pressure around your eyes, cheeks and forehead.	general
Perhaps your head throbs.	general
However, many people who assume they have headaches from sinusitis, including many who have received such a diagnosis, actually have migraines or tension headaches.	general
Products & Services Signs and symptoms of sinus headaches ‚Äî regardless of cause ‚Äî may include: Pain, pressure and fullness in your cheeks, brow or forehead Worsening pain if you bend forward or lie down Stuffy nose Sinusitis or migraine?	general
Migraines and headaches from sinusitis are easy to confuse because the signs and symptoms of the two types of headaches may overlap.	general
Both sinusitis and migraine headache pain often gets worse when you bend forward.	general
Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms ‚Äî including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge.	general
In fact, studies have shown that approximately 90 percent of people who see a doctor for sinus headaches are found to have migraines instead.	general
Sinusitis, however, usually isn't associated with nausea or vomiting or aggravated by noise or bright light ‚Äî all common features of migraines.	general
Sinusitis usually occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection or cold and includes thick, discolored nasal mucus, decreased sense of smell, and pain in one cheek or upper teeth.	general
Headaches due to sinus disease often last days or longer and migraine headaches most commonly last hours to a day or two.	general
When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if: Your headache symptoms occur more than 15 days a month or require frequent over-the-counter pain medicine You have a severe headache, and over-the-counter pain medicine doesn't help You miss school or work because of frequent headaches or the headaches interfere with your daily life Sinus headaches are usually associated with migraines or other forms of headaches.	general
Sinus headaches are associated with pain and pressure in the face and sinuses and can cause nasal symptoms.	general
Most of these headaches are not caused by sinus infections and should not be treated with antibiotics.	general
Risk factors Sinus headaches can affect anyone but may be more likely if you have: A previous history of migraines or headaches A family history of migraines or headaches Hormonal changes associated with headaches Whether or not you take preventive medications, you may benefit from lifestyle changes that can help reduce the number and severity of headaches.	general
One or more of these suggestions may be helpful for you: If certain foods or odors seem to have triggered your headaches in the past, avoid them.	general
Your doctor may recommend you reduce your caffeine and alcohol intake and avoid tobacco.	general
Avoid triggers.	general
In general, establish a daily routine with regular sleep patterns and regular meals.	general
In addition, try to control stress.	general
Regular aerobic exercise reduces tension and can help prevent headaches.	general
If your doctor agrees, choose any aerobic exercise you enjoy, including walking, swimming and cycling.	general
Exercise regularly.	general
Warm up slowly, however, because sudden, intense exercise can cause headaches.	general
Obesity is also thought to be a factor in headaches, and regular exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight or lose weight.	general
If you're a woman who has headaches and estrogen seems to trigger or make your headaches worse, you may want to avoid or reduce the medications you take that contain estrogen.	general
Reduce the effects of estrogen.	general
These medications include birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy.	general
Talk with your doctor about the appropriate alternatives or dosages for you.	general
Spinal headaches occur in up to 40 percent of those who undergo a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) or spinal anesthesia.	general
Both procedures require a puncture of the tough membrane that surrounds the spinal cord and, in the lower spine, the lumbar and sacral nerve roots.	general
During a spinal tap, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn from your spinal canal.	general
During spinal anesthesia, medication is injected into your spinal canal to numb the nerves in the lower half of your body.	general
If spinal fluid leaks through the tiny puncture site, you may develop a spinal headache.	general
Most spinal headaches ‚Äî also known as post-lumbar puncture headaches ‚Äî resolve on their own with no treatment.	general
However, severe spinal headaches lasting 24 hours or more may need treatment.	general
Products & Services Spinal headache symptoms include: Dull, throbbing pain that varies in intensity from mild to incapacitating Pain that typically gets worse when you sit up or stand and decreases or goes away when you lie down Spinal headaches are often accompanied by: Hearing loss When to see a doctor Tell your doctor if you develop a headache after a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia ‚Äî especially if the headache gets worse when you sit up or stand.	general
Spinal headaches are caused by leakage of spinal fluid through a puncture hole in the tough membrane (dura mater) that surrounds the spinal cord.	general
This leakage decreases the pressure exerted by the spinal fluid on the brain and spinal cord, which leads to a headache.	general
Spinal headaches typically appear within 48 hours after a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia.	general
Sometimes epidural anesthesia may lead to a spinal headache as well.	general
Although epidural anesthetic is injected just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord, a spinal headache is possible if the membrane is unintentionally punctured.	general
A tension headache is generally a diffuse, mild to moderate pain in your head that's often described as feeling like a tight band around your head.	general
A tension headache (tension-type headache) is the most common type of headache, and yet its causes aren't well-understood.	general
Treatments for tension headaches are available.	general
Managing a tension headache is often a balance between fostering healthy habits, finding effective nondrug treatments and using medications appropriately.	general
Products & Services Dull, aching head pain Sensation of tightness or pressure across your forehead or on the sides and back of your head Tenderness on your scalp, neck and shoulder muscles Tension headaches are divided into two main categories ‚Äî episodic and chronic.	general
Episodic tension headaches Episodic tension headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week.	general
Frequent episodic tension headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months.	general
Frequent episodic tension headaches may become chronic.	general
Chronic tension headaches This type of tension headache lasts hours and may be continuous.	general
If your headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months, they're considered chronic.	general
Tension headaches vs.	general
migraines Tension headaches can be difficult to distinguish from migraines.	general
Plus, if you have frequent episodic tension headaches, you can also have migraines.	general
Unlike some forms of migraine, tension headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances, nausea or vomiting.	general
Although physical activity typically aggravates migraine pain, it doesn't make tension headache pain worse.	general
An increased sensitivity to either light or sound can occur with a tension headache, but these aren't common symptoms.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor If tension headaches disrupt your life or you need to take medication for your headaches more than twice a week, see your doctor.	general
Even if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different.	general
Occasionally, headaches may indicate a serious medical condition, such as a brain tumor or rupture of a weakened blood vessel (aneurysm).	general
When to seek emergency help If you have any of these signs or symptoms, seek emergency care: Abrupt, severe headache Headache with a fever, stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness or speaking difficulties Headache after a head injury, especially if the headache gets worse The cause of tension headaches is not known.	general
Experts used to think tension headaches stemmed from muscle contractions in the face, neck and scalp, perhaps as a result of heightened emotions, tension or stress.	general
But research suggests muscle contraction isn't the cause.	general
The most common theory supports a heightened sensitivity to pain in people who have tension headaches.	general
Increased muscle tenderness, a common symptom of tension headaches, may result from a sensitized pain system.	general
Stress is the most commonly reported trigger for tension headaches.	general
Complications Because tension headaches are so common, their effect on job productivity and overall quality of life is considerable, particularly if they're chronic.	general
The frequent pain may render you unable to attend activities.	general
You might need to stay home from work, or if you do go to your job, your ability to function is impaired.	general
In addition to regular exercise, techniques such as biofeedback training and relaxation therapy can help reduce stress.	general
This technique teaches you to control certain body responses that help reduce pain.	general
During a biofeedback session, you're connected to devices that monitor and give you feedback on body functions such as muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure.	general
You then learn how to reduce muscle tension and slow your heart rate and breathing yourself.	general
Biofeedback training.	general
This type of talk therapy may help you learn to manage stress and may help reduce the frequency and severity of your headaches.	general
Cognitive behavioral therapy.	general
Anything that helps you relax, including deep breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation, may help your headaches.	general
You can learn relaxation techniques in classes or at home using books or tapes.	general
Other relaxation techniques.	general
Using medications in conjunction with stress management techniques may be more effective than is either treatment alone in reducing your tension headaches.	general
Additionally, living a healthy lifestyle may help prevent headaches: Get enough, but not too much, sleep.	general
Don't smoke.	general
Exercise regularly.	general
Thunderclap headaches live up to their name, striking suddenly like a clap of thunder.	general
The pain of these severe headaches peaks within 60 seconds.	general
Thunderclap headaches are uncommon, but they can warn of potentially life-threatening conditions ‚Äî usually having to do with bleeding in and around the brain.	general
Seek emergency medical attention for a thunderclap headache.	general
Products & Services Strikes suddenly and severely Peaks within 60 seconds Can be accompanied by nausea or vomiting Thunderclap headaches might be accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as: Altered mental state When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical attention for any headache that comes on suddenly and severely.	general
There's no obvious cause for some thunderclap headaches.	general
Headaches in children are common and usually aren't serious.	general
Like adults, children can develop different types of headaches, including migraines or stress-related (tension) headaches.	general
Children can also have chronic daily headaches.	general
In some cases, headaches in children are caused by an infection, high levels of stress or anxiety, or minor head trauma.	general
It's important to pay attention to your child's headache symptoms and consult a doctor if the headache worsens or occurs frequently.	general
Headaches in children usually can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications and healthy habits such as a regular schedule for sleeping and eating.	general
Products & Services Children get the same types of headaches adults do, but their symptoms may be a little different.	general
For example, migraine pain in adults often lasts at least four hours ‚Äî but in children, the pain may be much less than that.	general
Differences in symptoms may make it difficult to pinpoint headache type in a child, especially in a younger child who can't describe symptoms.	general
In general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently under certain categories.	general
Pain that worsens with exertion Extreme sensitivity to light and sound Even infants can have migraines.	general
A child who's too young to tell you what's wrong may cry and hold his or her head to indicate severe pain.	general
Tension-type headache Tension-type headaches can cause: A pressing tightness in the muscles of the head or neck Mild to moderate, nonpulsating pain on both sides of the head Pain that's not worsened by physical activity Headache that's not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the case with migraine Younger children may withdraw from regular play and want to sleep more.	general
Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days.	general
Cluster headache Cluster headaches are uncommon in children under 10 years of age.	general
"They usually: Occur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging from one headache every other day to eight a day Involve sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts less than three hours Are accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or restlessness or agitation Chronic daily headache Doctors use the phrase ""chronic daily headache"" (CDH) for migraines and tension-type headaches that occur more than 15 days a month."	general
may be caused by an infection, minor head injury or taking pain medications ‚Äî even nonprescription pain medications ‚Äî too often.	general
When to see a doctor Most headaches aren't serious, but seek prompt medical care if your child's headaches: Wake your child from sleep Worsen or become more frequent Change your child's personality Follow an injury, such as a blow to the head Feature persistent vomiting or visual changes Are accompanied by fever and neck pain or stiffness Talk to your child's doctor if you're worried or have questions about your child's headaches.	general
A number of factors can cause your child to develop headaches.	general
Factors include: Common illnesses such as colds, flu, and ear and sinus infections are some of the most frequent causes of headaches in children.	general
Very rarely, meningitis or encephalitis may cause headaches.	general
Illness and infection.	general
Bumps and bruises can cause headaches.	general
Although most head injuries are minor, seek prompt medical attention if your child falls hard on his or her head or gets hit hard in the head.	general
Also, contact a doctor if your child's head pain steadily worsens after a head injury.	general
Head trauma.	general
Stress and anxiety ‚Äî perhaps triggered by problems with peers, teachers or parents ‚Äî can play a role in children's headaches.	general
Children with depression may complain of headaches, particularly if they have trouble recognizing feelings of sadness and loneliness.	general
Emotional factors.	general
Headaches, particularly migraines, tend to run in families.	general
Genetic predisposition.	general
Nitrates ‚Äî a food preservative found in cured meats, such as bacon, bologna and hot dogs ‚Äî can trigger headaches, as can the food additive MSG.	general
Also, too much caffeine ‚Äî contained in soda, chocolates, coffees and teas ‚Äî can cause headaches.	general
Certain foods and beverages.	general
Rarely, a brain tumor or abscess or bleeding in the brain can press on areas of the brain, causing a chronic, worsening headache.	general
Typically in these cases, however, there are other symptoms, such as visual problems, dizziness and lack of coordination.	general
Problems in the brain.	general
Risk factors Any child can develop headaches, but they're more common in: Girls after they reach puberty Children who have a family history of headaches or migraines Older teens The following may help you prevent headaches or reduce the severity of headaches in children: Behaviors that promote general good health also may help prevent headaches for your child.	general
These lifestyle measures include getting plenty of sleep, staying physically active, eating healthy meals and snacks, drinking four to eight glasses of water daily, and avoiding caffeine.	general
Practice healthy behaviors.	general
Stress and busy schedules may increase the frequency of headaches.	general
Be alert for things that may cause stress in your child's life, such as difficulty doing schoolwork or strained relationships with peers.	general
If your child's headaches are linked to anxiety or depression, consider talking to a counselor.	general
Reduce stress.	general
A diary can help you determine what causes your child's headaches.	general
Note when the headaches start, how long they last and what, if anything, provides relief.	general
Keep a headache diary.	general
Record your child's response to taking any headache medication.	general
Over time, the items you note in the headache diary should help you understand your child's symptoms so that you can take specific preventive measures.	general
Avoid any food or drinks, such as those containing caffeine, that seem to trigger headaches.	general
Your headache diary can help you determine what prompts your child's headaches, so you know what to avoid.	general
Avoid headache triggers.	general
Your doctor may recommend preventive medication if the headaches are severe, occur daily and interfere with your child's normal lifestyle.	general
Certain medications taken at regular intervals ‚Äî such as certain antidepressants or anti-seizure medications ‚Äî may reduce the frequency and severity of headaches.	general
Follow your doctor's plan.	general
You may experience extreme anxiety that body sensations, such as muscle twitching or fatigue, are associated with a specific, serious illness.	general
This excessive anxiety ‚Äî rather than the physical symptom itself ‚Äî results in severe distress that can disrupt your life.	general
Illness anxiety disorder is a long-term condition that can fluctuate in severity.	general
It may increase with age or during times of stress.	general
But psychological counseling (psychotherapy) and sometimes medication can help ease your worries.	general
Hypochondria The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, no longer includes hypochondriasis ‚Äî also called hypochondria ‚Äî as a diagnosis.	general
Instead, people previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis may be diagnosed as having illness anxiety disorder, in which the focus of the fear and worry is on uncomfortable or unusual physical sensations being an indication of a serious medical condition.	general
On the other hand, somatic symptom disorder ‚Äï a related disorder ‚Äï involves focusing on the disabling nature of physical symptoms, such as pain or dizziness, without the worry that these symptoms represent a specific illness.	general
Symptoms of illness anxiety disorder involve preoccupation with the idea that you're seriously ill, based on normal body sensations (such as a noisy stomach) or minor signs (such as a minor rash).	general
Signs and symptoms may include: Being preoccupied with having or getting a serious disease or health condition Worrying that minor symptoms or body sensations mean you have a serious illness Being easily alarmed about your health status Finding little or no reassurance from doctor visits or negative test results Worrying excessively about a specific medical condition or your risk of developing a medical condition because it runs in your family Having so much distress about possible illnesses that it's hard for you to function Repeatedly checking your body for signs of illness or disease Frequently making medical appointments for reassurance ‚Äî or avoiding medical care for fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness Avoiding people, places or activities for fear of health risks Constantly talking about your health and possible illnesses Frequently searching the internet for causes of symptoms or possible illnesses When to see a doctor Because symptoms can be related to health problems, it's important to be evaluated by your primary care provider if this hasn't already been done.	general
If your provider believes that you may have illness anxiety disorder, he or she may refer you to a mental health professional.	general
Caring for a loved one Significant health anxiety can cause real distress for the person, and reassurance isn't always helpful.	general
Sometimes, providing reassurance can make things worse.	general
This can be frustrating and cause stress on families and relationships.	general
Encourage your loved one to consider a mental health referral to learn ways to cope with illness anxiety disorder.	general
The exact cause of illness anxiety disorder isn't clear, but these factors may play a role: You may have a difficult time tolerating uncertainty over uncomfortable or unusual body sensations.	general
This could lead you to misinterpret that all body sensations are serious, so you search for evidence to confirm that you have a serious disease.	general
You may be more likely to have health anxiety if you had parents who worried too much about their own health or your health.	general
You may have had experience with serious illness in childhood, so physical sensations may be frightening to you.	general
Past experience.	general
Risk factors Illness anxiety disorder usually begins in early or middle adulthood and may get worse with age.	general
Often for older individuals, health-related anxiety may focus on the fear of losing their memory.	general
Risk factors for illness anxiety disorder may include: A time of major life stress Threat of a serious illness that turns out not to be serious History of abuse as a child A serious childhood illness or a parent with a serious illness Personality traits, such as having a tendency toward being a worrier Excessive health-related internet use Relationship or family problems because excessive worrying can frustrate others Work-related performance problems or excessive absences Problems functioning in daily life, possibly even resulting in disability Financial problems due to excessive health care visits and medical bills Having another mental health disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, other anxiety disorders, depression or a personality disorder Little is known about how to prevent illness anxiety disorder, but these suggestions may help.	general
as soon as possible to help stop symptoms from getting worse and impairing your quality of life.	general
If you have problems with anxiety, seek professional advice ‚Äî and regularly practice stress management and relaxation techniques.	general
Learn to recognize when you're stressed and how this affects your body to help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms.	general
Hearing loss that occurs gradually as you age (presbycusis) is common.	general
About one-third of people in the United States between the ages of 65 and 75 have some degree of hearing loss.	general
For those older than 75, that number is approximately 1 in 2.	general
Hearing loss is defined as one of three types: Conductive (involves outer or middle ear) Sensorineural (involves inner ear) Mixed (combination of the two) Aging and chronic exposure to loud noises both contribute to hearing loss.	general
Other factors, such as excessive earwax, can temporarily reduce how well your ears conduct sounds.	general
You can't reverse most types of hearing loss.	general
However, you and your doctor or a hearing specialist can take steps to improve what you hear.	general
Parts of the ear The ear is made up of three primary parts: the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear.	general
Each section is composed of structures that play distinct roles in the process of converting sound waves into signals that go to the brain.	general
The outer ear is composed of the visible part of the ear (pinna) and the ear canal.	general
The cup-shaped pinna (PIN-uh) gathers sound waves from the environment and directs them into the ear canal.	general
The middle ear is an air-filled cavity that holds a chain of three bones: the hammer, anvil and stirrup.	general
These bones are separated from the outer ear by the eardrum (tympanic membrane), which when struck by a sound wave, vibrates.	general
The middle ear is connected to the back of your nose and upper part of your throat by a narrow channel called the auditory tube (eustachian tube).	general
The tube opens and closes at the throat end to equalize the pressure in the middle ear with that of the environment and drain fluids.	general
Equal pressure on both sides of the eardrum is important for normal vibration of the eardrum.	general
Bones of the middle ear The middle ear contains three tiny bones: Hammer (malleus) ‚Äî attached to eardrum Anvil (incus) ‚Äî in the middle of the chain of bones Stirrup (stapes) ‚Äî attached to the membrane-covered opening that connects the middle ear with the inner ear (oval window) The vibration of the eardrum triggers a chain of vibrations through the bones.	general
Because of differences in the size, shape and position of the three bones, the force of the vibration increases by the time it reaches the inner ear.	general
This increase in force is necessary to transfer the energy of the sound wave to the fluid of the inner ear.	general
The inner ear contains a group of interconnected, fluid-filled chambers.	general
The snail-shaped chamber, called the cochlea (KOK-lee-uh), plays a role in hearing.	general
Sound vibrations from the bones of the middle ear are transferred to the fluids of the cochlea.	general
Tiny sensors (hair cells) lining the cochlea convert the vibrations into electrical impulses that are transmitted along the auditory nerve to your brain.	general
The other fluid-filled chambers of the inner ear include three tubes called the semicircular canals (vestibular labyrinth).	general
Hair cells in the semicircular canals detect the motion of the fluids when you move in any direction.	general
They convert the motion into electrical signals that are transmitted along the vestibular nerve to the brain.	general
This sensory information enables you to maintain your sense of balance.	general
Traveling to the brain Electrical impulses travel along the auditory nerve and pass through several information-processing centers.	general
Signals from the right ear travel to the auditory cortex located in the temporal lobe on the left side of the brain.	general
Signals from the left ear travel to the right auditory cortex.	general
The auditory cortices sort, process, interpret and file information about the sound.	general
The comparison and analysis of all the signals that reach the brain enable you to detect certain sounds and suppress other sounds as background noise.	general
Products & Services Muffling of speech and other sounds Difficulty understanding words, especially against background noise or in a crowd Trouble hearing consonants Frequently asking others to speak more slowly, clearly and loudly Needing to turn up the volume of the television or radio Withdrawal from conversations Avoidance of some social settings When to see a doctor If you have a sudden loss of hearing, particularly in one ear, seek immediate medical attention.	general
Talk to your doctor if difficulty hearing is interfering with your daily life.	general
Age-related hearing loss occurs gradually, so you may not notice it at first.	general
To understand how hearing loss occurs, it can be helpful to first understand how you hear.	general
How you hear The middle ear includes three small bones ‚Äî the hammer (malleus), anvil (incus) and stirrup (stapes).	general
The middle ear is separated from your external ear by the eardrum and connected to the back of your nose and throat by a narrow passageway called the eustachian tube.	general
The cochlea, a snail-shaped structure, is part of your inner ear.	general
Your ear consists of three major areas: outer ear, middle ear and inner ear.	general
Sound waves pass through the outer ear and cause vibrations at the eardrum.	general
The eardrum and three small bones of the middle ear amplify the vibrations as they travel to the inner ear.	general
There, the vibrations pass through fluid in a snail-shaped structure in the inner ear (cochlea).	general
Attached to nerve cells in the cochlea are thousands of tiny hairs that help translate sound vibrations into electrical signals that are transmitted to your brain.	general
Your brain turns these signals into sound.	general
How hearing loss can occur Causes of hearing loss include: Aging and exposure to loud noise may cause wear and tear on the hairs or nerve cells in the cochlea that send sound signals to the brain.	general
When these hairs or nerve cells are damaged or missing, electrical signals aren't transmitted as efficiently, and hearing loss occurs.	general
Damage to the inner ear.	general
Higher pitched tones may become muffled to you.	general
It may become difficult for you to pick out words against background noise.	general
Earwax can block the ear canal and prevent conduction of sound waves.	general
Earwax removal can help restore your hearing.	general
Gradual buildup of earwax.	general
In the outer or middle ear, any of these can cause hearing loss.	general
Ear infection and abnormal bone growths or tumors.	general
Loud blasts of noise, sudden changes in pressure, poking your eardrum with an object and infection can cause your eardrum to rupture and affect your hearing.	general
Ruptured eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation).	general
Mayo Clinic Minute: What is hearing loss?	general
Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: What is hearing loss?	general
Hearing loss is very common.	general
Vivien Williams: There's a lot of different types of hearing loss.	general
Matthew Carlson, M.D.: Dr. Matthew Carlson says temporary hearing loss can happen when your ears are plugged with wax or fluid behind the ear drum, for example.	general
Nerve-related hearing loss is usually permanent.	general
Vivien Williams: We call it sensorineural hearing loss.	general
There are thousands of different causes of sensorineural hearing loss.	general
The most common is probably just being over the age of 50‚Ä¶ Dr. Carlson: ‚Ä¶or having a history of loud noise exposure.	general
Dr. Carlson says just about all types of sensorineural hearing loss have to do with the loss of the function of hair cells in your inner ear.	general
Vivien Williams: The hair cells, which are the end part of the inner ear that actually take the mechanical sound and turn it to electrical sound‚Ä¶ Dr. Carlson: ‚Ä¶become fewer or don't function well.	general
Hearing aids help to increase volume.	general
For people with profound hearing loss, cochlear implants work by bypassing the hair cells and sending signals directly to the hearing nerve and brain.	general
Once health care professionals figure out your type of hearing loss, they can tailor treatment that's best for you.	general
For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams.	general
Vivien Williams: Risk factors Factors that may damage or lead to loss of the hairs and nerve cells in your inner ear include: Degeneration of inner ear structures occurs over time.	general
Exposure to loud sounds can damage the cells of your inner ear.	general
Damage can occur with long-term exposure to loud noises, or from a short blast of noise, such as from a gunshot.	general
Loud noise.	general
Your genetic makeup may make you more susceptible to ear damage from sound or deterioration from aging.	general
Jobs where loud noise is a regular part of the working environment, such as farming, construction or factory work, can lead to damage inside your ear.	general
Occupational noises.	general
Exposure to explosive noises, such as from firearms and jet engines, can cause immediate, permanent hearing loss.	general
Other recreational activities with dangerously high noise levels include snowmobiling, motorcycling, carpentry or listening to loud music.	general
Recreational noises.	general
Drugs such as the antibiotic gentamicin, sildenafil (Viagra) and certain chemotherapy drugs, can damage the inner ear.	general
Temporary effects on your hearing ‚Äî ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or hearing loss ‚Äî can occur if you take very high doses of aspirin, other pain relievers, antimalarial drugs or loop diuretics.	general
Some medications.	general
Diseases or illnesses that result in high fever, such as meningitis, may damage the cochlea.	general
Some illnesses.	general
Comparing loudness of common sounds The chart below lists common sounds and their decibel levels.	general
The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) safe noise level is 70 decibels.	general
The louder the noise, the less time it takes to cause permanent hearing damage.	general
Sound levels of common noises Sandblasting Maximum sound-exposure durations Below are the maximum noise levels on the job to which you may be exposed without hearing protection, and for how long.	general
Maximum job-noise exposure allowed by law Sound level, decibels Complications Hearing loss can have a significant effect on your quality of life.	general
Older adults with hearing loss may report feelings of depression.	general
Because hearing loss can make conversation difficult, some people experience feelings of isolation.	general
Hearing loss is also associated with cognitive impairment and decline.	general
The mechanism of interaction between hearing loss, cognitive impairment, depression and isolation is being actively studied.	general
Initial research suggests that treating hearing loss can have a positive effect on cognitive performance, especially memory.	general
The following steps can help you prevent noise-induced hearing loss and avoid worsening of age-related hearing loss: Limiting the duration and intensity of your exposure to noise is the best protection.	general
In the workplace, plastic earplugs or glycerin-filled earmuffs can help protect your ears from damaging noise.	general
Protect your ears.	general
Consider regular hearing tests if you work in a noisy environment.	general
If you've lost some hearing, you can take steps to prevent further loss.	general
Have your hearing tested.	general
Activities such as riding a snowmobile, hunting, using power tools or listening to rock concerts can damage your hearing over time.	general
Wearing hearing protectors or taking breaks from the noise can protect your ears.	general
Turning down the music volume is helpful too.	general
Avoid recreational risks.	general
Mayo Clinic Minute: Can You Slow Down Age-Related Hearing Loss?	general

Are you increasing the volume on the TV or asking others to speak up?	general
You're not alone, especially if you're over age 50.	general
"""Age-related hearing loss is called 'presbycusis."	general
"'"" The older you get, the more wear and tear you have on your ears says Dr. Gayla Poling."	general
"""That's when we start noticing age-related hearing loss""."	general
Dr. Poling says the majority of hearing loss is preventable.	general
Hunters, for instance, are at risk of hearing loss.	general
"""If you can wear hearing protection, especially designed hearing protection typically for hunting, where you can reduce the loud noise exposure but still hear the environment around you, that can really prevent long-term damage""."	general
Dr. Poling says a hearing test can help evaluate whether you've experienced hearing loss.	general
"""We're looking at the threshold that which you can hear sounds the softest, and you're usually pressing a button or raising your hands or somehow responding to when you hear those sounds."	general
"And we're evaluating the entire auditory system in that process - not just with the earphones, but we do some other tests to evaluate your middle ear and the inner ear, as well""."	general
So before you have to turn up the sound, consider turning it down.	general
For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Ian Roth.	general
Heart attack Heart attack A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying your heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked.	general
Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in your heart's arteries.	general
If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and block your arteries, causing a heart attack.	general
During a heart attack, tissue in your heart muscle dies due to lack of blood flow through your heart's arteries.	general
A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked.	general
The blockage is most often a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries).	general
The plaque eventually breaks away and forms a clot.	general
The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.	general
A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years.	general
It's crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.	general
Products & Services Common heart attack signs and symptoms include: Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain Shortness of breath Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness Heart attack symptoms vary Not all people who have heart attacks have the same symptoms or have the same severity of symptoms.	general
Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain.	general
Some people have no symptoms; for others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest.	general
However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you're having a heart attack.	general
Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance.	general
The earliest warning might be recurrent chest pain or pressure (angina) that's triggered by exertion and relieved by rest.	general
Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart.	general
When to see a doctor Act immediately.	general
Some people wait too long because they don't recognize the important signs and symptoms.	general
Take these steps: If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't hesitate.	general
Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number.	general
If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital.	general
Call for emergency medical help.	general
Drive yourself only if there are no other options.	general
Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk.	general
Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help.	general
Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor.	general
Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting.	general
Take aspirin, if recommended.	general
Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don't take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it.	general
Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin.	general
Call for emergency help first.	general
What to do if you see someone who might be having a heart attack If you see someone who's unconscious and you believe is having a heart attack, first call for emergency medical help.	general
Then check if the person is breathing and has a pulse.	general
If the person isn't breathing or you don't find a pulse, only then should you begin CPR to keep blood flowing.	general
Push hard and fast on the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm ‚Äî about 100 to 120 compressions a minute.	general
If you haven't been trained in CPR, doctors recommend performing only chest compressions.	general
If you have been trained in CPR, you can go on to opening the airway and rescue breathing.	general
More Information A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries become blocked.	general
Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis).	general
This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks.	general
During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and spill cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream.	general
A blood clot forms at the site of the rupture.	general
If large enough, the clot can block the flow of blood through the coronary artery, starving the heart muscle of oxygen and nutrients (ischemia).	general
You might have a complete blockage or partial.	general
A complete blockage means you've had an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).	general
A partial blockage means you've had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).	general
Diagnostic steps and treatment might be different depending on which you've had.	general
Another cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle.	general
Using tobacco and illicit drugs, such as cocaine, can cause a life-threatening spasm.	general
More Information Risk factors Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body.	general
You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or another heart attack.	general
Heart attack risk factors include: Men age 45 or older and women age 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women.	general
This includes smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke.	general
Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart.	general
High blood pressure that occurs with other conditions, such as obesity, high cholesterol or diabetes, increases your risk even more.	general
High blood pressure.	general
"A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries."	general
A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also ups your risk of heart attack.	general
"However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol) lowers your risk of heart attack."	general
High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels.	general
Obesity is associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes.	general
Losing just 10 percent of your body weight can lower this risk, however.	general
Not producing enough of a hormone secreted by your pancreas (insulin) or not responding to insulin properly causes your body's blood sugar levels to rise, increasing your risk of heart attack.	general
This occurs when you have obesity, high blood pressure and high blood sugar.	general
Having metabolic syndrome makes you twice as likely to develop heart disease than if you don't have it.	general
Metabolic syndrome.	general
If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for male relatives and by age 65 for female relatives), you might be at increased risk.	general
Family history of heart attack.	general
Being inactive contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity.	general
People who exercise regularly have better cardiovascular fitness, including lower high blood pressure.	general
Lack of physical activity.	general
You might respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack.	general
Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack.	general
Illicit drug use.	general
This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease.	general
A history of preeclampsia.	general
Having a condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can increase your risk of heart attack.	general
An autoimmune condition.	general
"Complications Complications are often related to the damage done to your heart during an attack, which can lead to: Electrical ""short circuits"" can develop, resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal."	general
Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).	general
An attack might damage so much heart tissue that the remaining heart muscle can't pump enough blood out of your heart.	general
Heart failure can be temporary, or it can be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart.	general
Heart failure.	general
Without warning, your heart stops due to an electrical disturbance that causes an arrhythmia.	general
Heart attacks increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest, which can be fatal without immediate treatment.	general
Sudden cardiac arrest.	general
It's never too late to take steps to prevent a heart attack ‚Äî even if you've already had one.	general
Here are ways to prevent a heart attack.	general
Taking medications can reduce your risk of a subsequent heart attack and help your damaged heart function better.	general
Continue to take what your doctor prescribes, and ask your doctor how often you need to be monitored.	general
Medications.	general
You know the drill: Maintain a healthy weight with a heart-healthy diet, don't smoke, exercise regularly, manage stress and control conditions that can lead to heart attack, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.	general
Lifestyle factors.	general
Heart murmurs are sounds during your heartbeat cycle ‚Äî such as whooshing or swishing ‚Äî made by turbulent blood in or near your heart.	general
These sounds can be heard with a stethoscope.	general
"A normal heartbeat makes two sounds like ""lubb-dupp"" (sometimes described as ""lub-DUP""), which are the sounds of your heart valves closing."	general
Heart murmurs can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life.	general
A heart murmur isn't a disease ‚Äî but murmurs may indicate an underlying heart problem.	general
Often, heart murmurs are harmless (innocent) and don't need treatment.	general
Some heart murmurs may require follow-up tests to be sure the murmur isn't caused by a serious underlying heart condition.	general
Treatment, if needed, is directed at the cause of your heart murmur.	general
Products & Services If you have a harmless heart murmur, more commonly known as an innocent heart murmur, you likely won't have any other signs or symptoms.	general
An abnormal heart murmur may cause no obvious other signs or symptoms, aside from the unusual sound your doctor hears when listening to your heart with a stethoscope.	general
But if you have these signs or symptoms, they may indicate a heart problem: Skin that appears blue, especially on your fingertips and lips Swelling or sudden weight gain Shortness of breath Heavy sweating with minimal or no exertion When to see a doctor Most heart murmurs aren't serious, but if you think you or your child has a heart murmur, make an appointment to see your family doctor.	general
Your doctor can tell you if your heart murmur is innocent and doesn't require any further treatment or if an underlying heart problem needs to be further examined.	general
There are two types of heart murmurs: innocent murmurs and abnormal murmurs.	general
A person with an innocent murmur has a normal heart.	general
This type of heart murmur is common in newborns and children.	general
An abnormal heart murmur is more serious.	general
In children, abnormal murmurs are usually caused by congenital heart disease.	general
In adults, abnormal murmurs are most often due to acquired heart valve problems.	general
Innocent heart murmurs An innocent murmur can occur when blood flows more rapidly than normal through the heart.	general
Conditions that may cause rapid blood flow through your heart, resulting in an innocent heart murmur, include: Physical activity or exercise Not having enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body tissues (anemia) An excessive amount of thyroid hormone in your body (hyperthyroidism) Phases of rapid growth, such as adolescence Innocent heart murmurs may disappear over time, or they may last your entire life without ever causing further health problems.	general
Abnormal heart murmurs The most common cause of abnormal murmurs in children is when babies are born with structural problems of the heart (congenital heart defects).	general
Common congenital defects that cause heart murmurs include: Known as septal defects, holes in the heart may or may not be serious, depending on the size of the hole and its location.	general
Holes in the heart or cardiac shunts.	general
Cardiac shunts occur when there's an abnormal blood flow between the heart chambers or blood vessels, which may lead to a heart murmur.	general
Congenital heart valve abnormalities are present at birth, but sometimes aren't discovered until much later in life.	general
Examples include valves that don't allow enough blood through them (stenosis) or those that don't close properly and leak (regurgitation).	general
Heart valve abnormalities.	general
Other causes of abnormal heart murmurs include infections and conditions that damage the structures of the heart and are more common in older children or adults.	general
For example: This hardening or thickening of valves, as in mitral stenosis or aortic valve stenosis, can occur as you age.	general
Valves may become narrowed (stenotic), making it harder for blood to flow through your heart, resulting in murmurs.	general
Valve calcification.	general
This infection of the inner lining of your heart and valves typically occurs when bacteria or other germs from another part of your body, such as your mouth, spread through your bloodstream and lodge in your heart.	general
Endocarditis.	general
Left untreated, endocarditis can damage or destroy your heart valves.	general
This condition usually occurs in people who already have heart valve abnormalities.	general
Although now rare in the United States, rheumatic fever is a serious condition that can occur when you don't receive prompt or complete treatment for a strep throat infection.	general
It can permanently affect the heart valves and interfere with normal blood flow through your heart.	general
Rheumatic fever.	general
Risk factors There are risk factors that increase your chances of developing a heart murmur, including: If blood relatives have had a heart defect, that increases the likelihood you or your child may also have a heart defect and heart murmur.	general
Family history of a heart defect.	general
including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), hyperthyroidism, an infection of the lining of the heart (endocarditis), high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension), carcinoid syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, a weakened heart muscle or a history of rheumatic fever, can increase your risk of a heart murmur later in life.	general
Certain medical conditions, Factors that increase your baby's risk of developing a heart murmur include: Having some conditions during pregnancy, such as uncontrolled diabetes or a rubella infection, increases your baby's risk of developing heart defects and a heart murmur.	general
Illnesses during pregnancy.	general
Use of certain medications, alcohol or drugs can harm a developing baby, leading to heart defects.	general
Taking certain medications or illegal drugs during pregnancy.	general
While there's not much you can do to prevent a heart murmur, it is reassuring to know that heart murmurs are not a disease and are often harmless.	general
For children, many murmurs go away on their own as children grow.	general
For adults, murmurs may disappear as the underlying condition causing them improves.	general

Heart palpitations (pal-pih-TAY-shuns) are the feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart.	general
Stress, exercise, medication or, rarely, a medical condition can trigger them.	general
Although heart palpitations can be worrisome, they're usually harmless.	general
In rare cases, they can be a symptom of a more serious heart condition, such as an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), that might require treatment.	general
Skipping beats Fluttering rapidly Flip-flopping You might feel heart palpitations in your throat or neck, as well as your chest.	general
They can occur when you're active or at rest.	general
When to see a doctor Palpitations that are infrequent and last only a few seconds usually don't need to be evaluated.	general
If you have a history of heart disease and have palpitations that occur frequently or worsen, talk to your doctor.	general
He or she might suggest heart-monitoring tests to see if your palpitations are caused by a more serious heart problem.	general
Seek emergency medical attention if heart palpitations are accompanied by: Chest discomfort or pain Often the cause of your heart palpitations can't be found.	general
Common causes include: Strong emotional responses, such as stress, anxiety or panic attacks Too much or to little thyroid hormone Occasionally heart palpitations can be a sign of a serious problem, such as an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia).	general
Arrhythmias might cause a very fast heart rate (tachycardia), an unusually slow heart rate (bradycardia) or an irregular heart rhythm.	general
Risk factors You might be at risk of developing palpitations if you: Are highly stressed Are pregnant Take medicines that contain stimulants, such as some cold or asthma medications Have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) Have other heart problems, such as an arrhythmia, heart defect, previous heart attack or previous heart surgery Complications Unless a heart condition is causing your heart palpitations, there's little risk of complications.	general
For palpitations caused by a heart condition, possible complications include: If your heart beats rapidly, your blood pressure can drop, causing you to faint.	general
This might be more likely if you have a heart problem, such as congenital heart disease or certain valve problems.	general
Rarely, palpitations can be caused by life-threatening arrhythmias and can cause your heart to stop beating effectively.	general
Cardiac arrest.	general
If palpitations are due to a condition in which the upper chambers of the heart quiver instead of beating properly (atrial fibrillation), blood can pool and cause clots to form.	general
If a clot breaks loose, it can block a brain artery, causing a stroke.	general
This can result if your heart is pumping ineffectively for a prolonged period due to an arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation.	general
Sometimes, controlling the rate of an arrhythmia that's causing heart failure can improve your heart's function.	general
Heart failure.	general
Heartburn is a burning pain in your chest, just behind your breastbone.	general
The pain is often worse after eating, in the evening, or when lying down or bending over.	general
Occasional heartburn is common and no cause for alarm.	general
Most people can manage the discomfort of heartburn on their own with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medications.	general
Heartburn that is more frequent or interferes with your daily routine may be a symptom of a more serious condition that requires medical care.	general
Products & Services Symptoms of heartburn include: A burning pain in the chest that usually occurs after eating and may occur at night Pain that worsens when lying down or bending over Bitter or acidic taste in the mouth When to see a doctor Seek immediate help if you experience severe chest pain or pressure, especially when combined with other signs and symptoms such as pain in the arm or jaw or difficulty breathing.	general
Chest pain may be a symptom of a heart attack.	general
Make an appointment with your doctor if: Heartburn occurs more than twice a week Symptoms persist despite use of over-the-counter medications You have difficulty swallowing You have persistent nausea or vomiting You have weight loss because of poor appetite or difficulty eating More Information How heartburn and GERD occur How heartburn and GERD occur Acid reflux occurs when the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your esophagus relaxes at the wrong time, allowing stomach acid to back up into your esophagus.	general
This can cause heartburn and other signs and symptoms.	general
Frequent or constant reflux can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).	general
Heartburn occurs when stomach acid backs up into the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach (esophagus).	general
Normally when you swallow, a band of muscle around the bottom of your esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter) relaxes to allow food and liquid to flow down into your stomach.	general
Then the muscle tightens again.	general
If the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes abnormally or weakens, stomach acid can flow back up into your esophagus (acid reflux) and cause heartburn.	general
The acid backup may be worse when you're bent over or lying down.	general
More Information Certain foods and drinks can trigger heartburn in some people, including: Spicy foods Fatty or fried foods Large or fatty meals Being overweight or pregnant also can increase your risk of experiencing heartburn.	general
Complications Heartburn that occurs frequently and interferes with your routine is considered gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).	general
GERD treatment may require prescription medications and, occasionally, surgery or other procedures.	general
GERD can seriously damage your esophagus or lead to precancerous changes in the esophagus called Barrett's esophagus.	general
Heat exhaustion is a condition whose symptoms may include heavy sweating and a rapid pulse, a result of your body overheating.	general
It's one of three heat-related syndromes, with heat cramps being the mildest and heatstroke being the most severe.	general
Causes of heat exhaustion include exposure to high temperatures, particularly when combined with high humidity, and strenuous physical activity.	general
Without prompt treatment, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, a life-threatening condition.	general
Fortunately, heat exhaustion is preventable.	general
Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion may develop suddenly or over time, especially with prolonged periods of exercise.	general
Possible heat exhaustion signs and symptoms include: Cool, moist skin with goose bumps when in the heat Heavy sweating Muscle cramps If you think you're experiencing heat exhaustion: Stop all activity and rest Move to a cooler place Drink cool water or sports drinks Contact your doctor if your signs or symptoms worsen or if they don't improve within one hour.	general
If you are with someone showing signs of heat exhaustion, seek immediate medical attention if he or she becomes confused or agitated, loses consciousness, or is unable to drink.	general
You will need immediate cooling and urgent medical attention if your core body temperature (measured by a rectal thermometer) reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher.	general
Your body's heat combined with environmental heat results in what's called your core temperature ‚Äî your body's internal temperature.	general
Your body needs to regulate the heat gain (and, in cold weather, heat loss) from the environment to maintain a core temperature that's normal, approximately 98.	general
6 F (37 C).	general
Your body's failure to cool itself In hot weather, your body cools itself mainly by sweating.	general
The evaporation of your sweat regulates your body temperature.	general
However, when you exercise strenuously or otherwise overexert in hot, humid weather, your body is less able to cool itself efficiently.	general
As a result, your body may develop heat cramps, the mildest form of heat-related illness.	general
Signs and symptoms of heat cramps usually include heavy sweating, fatigue, thirst and muscle cramps.	general
Prompt treatment usually prevents heat cramps from progressing to heat exhaustion.	general
You usually can treat heat cramps by drinking fluids or sports drinks containing electrolytes (Gatorade, Powerade, others), getting into cooler temperatures, such as an air-conditioned or shaded place, and resting.	general
Other causes Besides hot weather and strenuous activity, other causes of heat exhaustion include: which reduces your body's ability to sweat and maintain a normal temperature Dehydration, which can affect your body's ability to regulate your temperature Alcohol use, particularly in clothes that don't allow sweat to evaporate easily Overdressing, Risk factors Anyone can develop heat exhaustion, but certain factors increase your sensitivity to heat.	general
They include: Infants and children younger than 4 and adults older than 65 are at higher risk of heat exhaustion.	general
The body's ability to regulate its temperature isn't fully developed in the young and may be reduced by illness, medications or other factors in older adults.	general
Young age or old age.	general
Medications that affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond appropriately to heat include some used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems (beta blockers, diuretics), reduce allergy symptoms (antihistamines), calm you (tranquilizers), or reduce psychiatric symptoms such as delusions (antipsychotics).	general
Additionally, some illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can increase your core temperature.	general
Certain drugs.	general
Carrying excess weight can affect your body's ability to regulate its temperature and cause your body to retain more heat.	general
If you're not used to the heat, you're more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion.	general
Traveling to a warm climate from a cold one or living in an area that has experienced an early heat wave can put you at risk of a heat-related illness because your body hasn't had a chance to get used to the higher temperatures.	general
Sudden temperature changes.	general
The heat index is a single temperature value that considers how both the outdoor temperature and humidity make you feel.	general
When the humidity is high, your sweat can't evaporate as easily and your body has more difficulty cooling itself, making you prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke.	general
When the heat index is 91 F (33 C) or higher, you should take precautions to keep cool.	general
A high heat index.	general
Complications Untreated, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, a life-threatening condition that occurs when your core body temperature reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher.	general
Heatstroke requires immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage to your brain and other vital organs that can result in death.	general
You can take a number of precautions to prevent heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses.	general
When temperatures climb, remember to: Wearing excess clothing or clothing that fits tightly won't allow your body to cool properly.	general
Wear loosefitting, lightweight clothing.	general
Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself, so protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15.	general
Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours ‚Äî or more often if you're swimming or sweating.	general
Protect against sunburn.	general
Staying hydrated will help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature.	general
Drink plenty of fluids.	general
Be on the lookout for heat-related problems if you take medications that can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and dissipate heat.	general
Take extra precautions with certain medications.	general
This is a common cause of heat-related deaths in children.	general
When parked in the sun, the temperature in your car can rise 20 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 6.	general
7 C) in 10 minutes.	general
Never leave anyone in a parked car.	general
It's not safe to leave a person in a parked car in warm or hot weather, even if the windows are cracked or the car is in shade.	general
When your car is parked, keep it locked to prevent a child from getting inside.	general
If you can't avoid strenuous activity in hot weather, drink fluids and rest frequently in a cool spot.	general
Try to schedule exercise or physical labor for cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or evening.	general
Take it easy during the hottest parts of the day.	general
Limit time spent working or exercising in heat until you're conditioned to it.	general
People who are not used to hot weather are especially susceptible to heat-related illness.	general
It can take several weeks for your body to adjust to hot weather.	general
Get acclimated.	general
If you take medications or have a condition that increases your risk of heat-related problems, such as a history of previous heat illness, avoid the heat and act quickly if you notice symptoms of overheating.	general
If you participate in a strenuous sporting event or activity in hot weather, make sure there are medical services available in case of a heat emergency.	general
Be cautious if you're at increased risk.	general
Miliaria rubra (A), one type of heat rash, appears as red clusters of small blister-like bumps that can produce intense itching.	general
Miliaria crystallina (B), another type of heat rash, appears as clear, fluid-filled bumps that produce no other signs or symptoms.	general
Heat rash ‚Äî also known as prickly heat and miliaria ‚Äî isn't just for babies.	general
It affects adults, too, especially during hot, humid weather.	general
Heat rash develops when blocked pores (sweat ducts) trap perspiration under your skin.	general
Symptoms range from superficial blisters to deep, red lumps.	general
Some forms of heat rash feel prickly or intensely itchy.	general
Heat rash usually clears on its own.	general
Severe forms of the condition may need medical care, but the best way to relieve symptoms is to cool your skin and prevent sweating.	general
Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing causes friction.	general
In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest.	general
It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin.	general
Types of heat rash The types of miliaria are classified according to how deep the blocked sweat ducts are.	general
Signs and symptoms for each type vary.	general
The mildest form of heat rash (miliaria crystallina affects the sweat ducts in the top layer of skin.	general
This form is marked by clear, fluid-filled blisters and bumps (papules) that break easily.	general
A type that occurs deeper in the skin (miliaria rubra) is sometimes called prickly heat.	general
Signs and symptoms include red bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area.	general
Occasionally, the fluid-containing sacs (vesicles) of miliaria rubra become inflamed and pus-filled (pustular).	general
This form is called miliaria pustulosa.	general
A less common form of heat rash (miliaria profunda) affects the dermis, a deeper layer of skin.	general
Retained sweat leaks out of the sweat gland into the skin, causing firm, flesh-colored lesions that resemble goose bumps.	general
When to see a doctor Heat rash usually heals by cooling the skin and avoiding exposure to the heat that caused it.	general
See your doctor if you or your child has symptoms that last longer than a few days, the rash seems to be getting worse, or you notice signs of infection, such as: Increased pain, swelling, redness or warmth around the affected area Pus draining from the lesions Swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, neck or groin A fever or chills Heat rash develops when some of your sweat ducts clog.	general
Instead of evaporating, perspiration gets trapped beneath the skin, causing inflammation and rash.	general
It's not always clear why the sweat ducts become blocked, but certain factors seem to play a role, including: A newborn's sweat ducts aren't fully developed.	general
They can rupture more easily, trapping perspiration beneath the skin.	general
Heat rash can develop in the first week of life, especially if the infant is being warmed in an incubator, is dressed too warmly or has a fever.	general
Immature sweat ducts.	general
Hot, humid weather can cause heat rash.	general
Tropical climates.	general
Intense exercise, hard work or any activity that causes you to sweat heavily can lead to heat rash.	general
Physical activity.	general
Overheating in general ‚Äî dressing too warmly or sleeping under an electric blanket ‚Äî can lead to heat rash.	general
Overheating.	general
Heat rash can also occur in people who are confined to bed for long periods, especially if they have a fever.	general
Prolonged bed rest.	general
Risk factors Factors that make you more prone to heat rash include: Newborns are most susceptible.	general
People living in the tropics are far more likely to have heat rash than are people in temperate climates.	general
Tropical climates.	general
Anything that makes you sweat heavily, especially if you're not wearing clothing that allows the sweat to evaporate, can trigger heat rash.	general
Physical activity.	general
Complications Heat rash usually heals without problems, but it can lead to infection with bacteria, causing inflamed and itchy pustules.	general
To help protect yourself or your child from heat rash: In summer, wear soft, lightweight, cotton clothing.	general
In winter, children should dress only as warmly as an adult.	general
Avoid overdressing.	general
that can irritate skin.	general
Avoid tightfitting clothes or use a fan to circulate the air.	general
When it's hot, stay in the shade or in an air-conditioned building and well-ventilated.	general
Heatstroke is a condition caused by your body overheating, usually as a result of prolonged exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures.	general
This most serious form of heat injury, heatstroke, can occur if your body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher.	general
The condition is most common in the summer months.	general
Heatstroke requires emergency treatment.	general
Untreated heatstroke can quickly damage your brain, heart, kidneys and muscles.	general
The damage worsens the longer treatment is delayed, increasing your risk of serious complications or death.	general
Heatstroke signs and symptoms include: A core body temperature of 104 F (40 C) or higher, obtained with a rectal thermometer, is the main sign of heatstroke.	general
High body temperature.	general
Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke.	general
Altered mental state or behavior.	general
In heatstroke brought on by hot weather, your skin will feel hot and dry to the touch.	general
However, in heatstroke brought on by strenuous exercise, your skin may feel dry or slightly moist.	general
Alteration in sweating.	general
You may feel sick to your stomach or vomit.	general
Nausea and vomiting.	general
Your skin may turn red as your body temperature increases.	general
Flushed skin.	general
Your breathing may become rapid and shallow.	general
Rapid breathing.	general
Your pulse may significantly increase because heat stress places a tremendous burden on your heart to help cool your body.	general
Racing heart rate.	general
Your head may throb.	general
When to see a doctor If you think a person may be experiencing heatstroke, seek immediate medical help.	general
Call 911 or your local emergency services number.	general
Take immediate action to cool the overheated person while waiting for emergency treatment.	general
Get the person into shade or indoors.	general
Remove excess clothing.	general
Cool the person with whatever means available ‚Äî put in a cool tub of water or a cool shower, spray with a garden hose, sponge with cool water, fan while misting with cool water, or place ice packs or cold, wet towels on the person's head, neck, armpits and groin.	general
Heatstroke can occur as a result of: In a type of heatstroke, called nonexertional (classic) heatstroke, being in a hot environment leads to a rise in core body temperature.	general
This type of heatstroke typically occurs after exposure to hot, humid weather, especially for prolonged periods.	general
It occurs most often in older adults and in people with chronic illness.	general
Exposure to a hot environment.	general
Exertional heatstroke is caused by an increase in core body temperature brought on by intense physical activity in hot weather.	general
Anyone exercising or working in hot weather can get exertional heatstroke, but it's most likely to occur if you're not used to high temperatures.	general
Strenuous activity.	general
In either type of heatstroke, your condition can be brought on by: that prevents sweat from evaporating easily and cooling your body Wearing excess clothing which can affect your body's ability to regulate your temperature Drinking alcohol, by not drinking enough water to replenish fluids lost through sweating Becoming dehydrated Risk factors Anyone can develop heatstroke, but several factors increase your risk: Your ability to cope with extreme heat depends on the strength of your central nervous system.	general
In the very young, the central nervous system is not fully developed, and in adults over 65, the central nervous system begins to deteriorate, which makes your body less able to cope with changes in body temperature.	general
Both age groups usually have difficulty remaining hydrated, which also increases risk.	general
Military training and participating in sports, such as football or long-distance running events, in hot weather are among the situations that can lead to heatstroke.	general
Exertion in hot weather.	general
You may be more susceptible to heat-related illness if you're exposed to a sudden increase in temperature, such as during an early-summer heat wave or travel to a hotter climate.	general
Limit activity for at least several days to allow yourself to acclimate to the change.	general
However, you may still have an increased risk of heatstroke until you've experienced several weeks of higher temperatures.	general
Sudden exposure to hot weather.	general
Fans may make you feel better, but during sustained hot weather, air conditioning is the most effective way to cool down and lower humidity.	general
A lack of air conditioning.	general
Some medications affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat.	general
Be especially careful in hot weather if you take medications that narrow your blood vessels (vasoconstrictors), regulate your blood pressure by blocking adrenaline (beta blockers), rid your body of sodium and water (diuretics), or reduce psychiatric symptoms (antidepressants or antipsychotics).	general
Certain medications.	general
Stimulants for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and illegal stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine also make you more vulnerable to heatstroke.	general
Certain chronic illnesses, such as heart or lung disease, might increase your risk of heatstroke.	general
So can being obese, being sedentary and having a history of previous heatstroke.	general
Certain health conditions.	general
Complications Heatstroke can result in a number of complications, depending on how long the body temperature is high.	general
Severe complications include: Without a quick response to lower body temperature, heatstroke can cause your brain or other vital organs to swell, possibly resulting in permanent damage.	general
Vital organ damage.	general
Without prompt and adequate treatment, heatstroke can be fatal.	general
Heatstroke is predictable and preventable.	general
Take these steps to prevent heatstroke during hot weather: Wearing excess clothing or clothing that fits tightly won't allow your body to cool properly.	general
Wear loosefitting, lightweight clothing.	general
Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself, so protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15.	general

It's not safe to leave a person in a parked car in warm or hot weather, even if the windows are cracked or the car is in shade.	general
When your car is parked, keep it locked to prevent a child from getting inside.	general
If you can't avoid strenuous activity in hot weather, drink fluids and rest frequently in a cool spot.	general
Try to schedule exercise or physical labor for cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or evening.	general
Take it easy during the hottest parts of the day.	general
Limit time spent working or exercising in heat until you're conditioned to it.	general
People who are not used to hot weather are especially susceptible to heat-related illness.	general
It can take several weeks for your body to adjust to hot weather.	general
Get acclimated.	general
If you take medications or have a condition that increases your risk of heat-related problems, avoid the heat and act quickly if you notice symptoms of overheating.	general
If you participate in a strenuous sporting event or activity in hot weather, make sure there are medical services available in case of a heat emergency.	general
Be cautious if you're at increased risk.	general
Plantar fasciitis Plantar fasciitis Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation of the fibrous tissue (plantar fascia) along the bottom of your foot that connects your heel bone to your toes.	general
Plantar fasciitis can cause intense heel pain.	general
Plantar fasciitis (PLAN-tur fas-e-I-tis) is one of the most common causes of heel pain.	general
It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes (plantar fascia).	general
Plantar fasciitis commonly causes stabbing pain that usually occurs with your first steps in the morning.	general
As you get up and move, the pain normally decreases, but it might return after long periods of standing or when you stand up after sitting.	general
Plantar fasciitis is more common in runners.	general
People who are overweight and those who wear shoes with inadequate support also have an increased risk of plantar fasciitis.	general
Products & Services Plantar fasciitis typically causes a stabbing pain in the bottom of your foot near the heel.	general
The pain is usually the worst with the first few steps after awakening, although it can also be triggered by long periods of standing or when you get up after sitting.	general
The pain is usually worse after exercise, not during it.	general
Your plantar fascia is in the shape of a bowstring, supporting the arch of your foot and absorbing shock when you walk.	general
If tension and stress on this bowstring become too great, small tears can occur in the fascia.	general
Repeated stretching and tearing can irritate or inflame the fascia, although the cause remains unclear in many cases of plantar fasciitis.	general
Risk factors Even though plantar fasciitis can develop without an obvious cause, some factors can increase your risk of developing this condition.	general
They include: Plantar fasciitis is most common between the ages of 40 and 60.	general
Activities that place a lot of stress on your heel and attached tissue ‚Äî such as long-distance running, ballet dancing and aerobic dance ‚Äî can contribute to the onset of plantar fasciitis.	general
Certain types of exercise.	general
Flat feet, a high arch or even an abnormal pattern of walking can affect the way weight is distributed when you're standing and can put added stress on the plantar fascia.	general
Foot mechanics.	general
Excess pounds put extra stress on your plantar fascia.	general
Factory workers, teachers and others who spend most of their work hours walking or standing on hard surfaces can damage the plantar fascia.	general
Occupations that keep you on your feet.	general
Complications Ignoring plantar fasciitis may result in chronic heel pain that hinders your regular activities.	general
Changing the way you walk as a way to relieve plantar fasciitis pain might lead to foot, knee, hip or back problems.	general
Helicobacter pylori (H.	general
pylori) infection occurs when a type of bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H.	general
pylori) infects your stomach.	general
This usually happens during childhood.	general
A common cause of peptic ulcers, H. pylori infection may be present in more than half the people in the world.	general
Most people don't realize they have H. pylori infection, because they never get sick from it.	general
If you develop signs and symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your doctor will probably test you for H. pylori infection.	general
If you have H. pylori infection, it can be treated with antibiotics.	general
Most people with H. pylori infection will never have any signs or symptoms.	general
It's not clear why this is, but some people may be born with more resistance to the harmful effects of H. pylori.	general
When signs or symptoms do occur with H. pylori infection, they may include: An ache or burning pain in your abdomen Abdominal pain that's worse when your stomach is empty When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.	general
Seek immediate medical help if you experience: Severe or persistent abdominal pain Difficulty swallowing Bloody or black tarry stools Bloody or black vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds The exact way H. pylori infects someone is still unknown.	general
H. pylori bacteria may be passed from person to person through direct contact with saliva, vomit or fecal matter.	general
H. pylori may also be spread through contaminated food or water.	general
Risk factors H. pylori is often contracted in childhood.	general
Risk factors for H. pylori infection are related to living conditions in your childhood, such as: You have a greater risk of H. pylori infection if you live in a home with many other people.	general
Living in crowded conditions.	general
Having a reliable supply of clean, running water helps reduce the risk of H. pylori.	general
Living without a reliable supply of clean water.	general
People living in developing countries, where crowded and unsanitary living conditions may be more common, have a higher risk of H. pylori infection.	general
Living in a developing country.	general
If someone you live with has H. pylori, you're more likely to also have H. pylori.	general
Living with someone who has an H. pylori infection.	general
Complications A peptic ulcer is a sore on the lining of your stomach, small intestine or esophagus.	general
A peptic ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer.	general
A duodenal ulcer is a peptic ulcer that develops in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum).	general
An esophageal ulcer occurs in the lower part of your esophagus.	general
Complications associated with H. pylori infection include: H. pylori can damage the protective lining of your stomach and small intestine.	general
This can allow stomach acid to create an open sore (ulcer).	general
About 10 percent of people with H. pylori will develop an ulcer.	general
H. pylori infection can irritate your stomach, causing inflammation (gastritis).	general
Inflammation of the stomach lining.	general
H. pylori infection is a strong risk factor for certain types of stomach cancer.	general
Stomach cancer.	general
In areas of the world where H. pylori infection and its complications are common, doctors sometimes test healthy people for H. pylori.	general
Whether there is a benefit to treating H. pylori when you have no signs or symptoms of infection is controversial among doctors.	general
If you're concerned about H. pylori infection or think you may have a high risk of stomach cancer, talk to your doctor.	general
Together you can decide whether you may benefit from H. pylori screening.	general
An infantile hemangioma is a birthmark that consists of an abnormally dense group of blood vessels.	general
The hemangioma appears on the surface of the skin as a spongy mass.	general
A hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh) is a bright red birthmark that shows up at birth or in the first or second week of life.	general
It looks like a rubbery bump and is made up of extra blood vessels in the skin.	general
A hemangioma can occur anywhere on the body, but most commonly appears on the face, scalp, chest or back.	general
Treatment for a baby's hemangioma (infantile hemangioma) usually isn't needed as it fades over time.	general
A child who has this condition during infancy usually has little visible trace of the growth by age 10.	general
You may want to consider treatment if a hemangioma interferes with seeing, breathing or other functions.	general
A hemangioma may be present at birth, but more often appears during the first several months of life.	general
It starts as a flat red mark anywhere on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back.	general
Usually a child has only one mark.	general
Some children may have more than one, particularly if they're part of a multiple birth.	general
During your child's first year, the red mark grows rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin.	general
The hemangioma then enters a rest phase and, eventually, it begins to slowly disappear.	general
Many hemangiomas disappear by age 5, and most are gone by age 10.	general
The skin may be slightly discolored or raised after the hemangioma goes away.	general
When to see a doctor Your child's doctor will monitor the hemangioma during routine checkups.	general
Contact your child's doctor if the hemangioma bleeds, forms a sore or looks infected.	general
Seek medical care if the condition interferes with your child's vision, breathing, hearing or elimination.	general
A hemangioma is made up of extra blood vessels that group together into a dense clump.	general
What causes the vessels to clump isn't known.	general
Risk factors Hemangiomas occur more often in babies who are female, white and born prematurely.	general
Complications Occasionally, a hemangioma can break down and develop a sore.	general
This can lead to pain, bleeding, scarring or infection.	general
Depending on where the hemangioma is situated, it may interfere with your child's vision, breathing, hearing or elimination, but this is rare.	general
Liver hemangioma Liver hemangioma A liver hemangioma is a noncancerous (benign) mass in the liver.	general
A liver hemangioma is made up of a tangle of blood vessels.	general
A liver hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh) is a noncancerous (benign) mass in the liver.	general
A liver hemangioma is made up of a tangle of blood vessels.	general
Other terms for a liver hemangioma are hepatic hemangioma and cavernous hemangioma.	general
Most cases of liver hemangiomas are discovered during a test or procedure for some other condition.	general
People who have a liver hemangioma rarely experience signs and symptoms and typically don't need treatment.	general
It may be unsettling to know you have a mass in your liver, even if it's a benign mass.	general
There's no evidence that an untreated liver hemangioma can lead to liver cancer.	general
The liver is your largest internal organ.	general
About the size of a football, it's located mainly in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and above your stomach.	general
In most cases, a liver hemangioma doesn't cause any signs or symptoms.	general
When a liver hemangioma causes signs and symptoms, they may include: Pain in the upper right abdomen Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food However, these symptoms are nonspecific and may be due to something else, even if you have a liver hemangioma.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.	general
It's not clear what causes a liver hemangioma to form.	general
Doctors believe liver hemangiomas are congenital ‚Äî meaning that you're born with them.	general
A liver hemangioma usually occurs as a single abnormal collection of blood vessels that is less than about 1.	general
5 inches (about 4 centimeters) wide.	general
Occasionally liver hemangiomas can be larger or occur in multiples.	general
Large hemangiomas can occur in young children but this is very rare.	general
In most people, a liver hemangioma will never grow and never cause any signs and symptoms.	general
But in a small number of people, a liver hemangioma will grow to cause complications and require treatment.	general
It's not clear why this happens.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk that a liver hemangioma will cause signs and symptoms include: A liver hemangioma can be diagnosed at any age, but it's most commonly diagnosed in people ages 30 to 50.	general
Women are more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than are men.	general
Women who have been pregnant are more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than women who have never been pregnant.	general
It's believed the hormone estrogen, which rises during pregnancy, may play a role in liver hemangioma growth.	general
Women who used hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms may be more likely to be diagnosed with a liver hemangioma than women who did not.	general
Hormone replacement therapy.	general
Complications Women who have been diagnosed with liver hemangiomas face a risk of complications if they become pregnant.	general
The female hormone estrogen, which increases during pregnancy, is believed to cause some liver hemangiomas to grow larger.	general
Rarely, growing hemangioma can cause signs and symptoms that may require treatment, including pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, abdominal bloating or nausea.	general
Having a liver hemangioma doesn't mean you can't become pregnant.	general
However, discussing the possible complications with your doctor can help you make a more informed choice.	general
Medications that affect hormone levels in your body, such as birth control pills, could cause complications if you've been diagnosed with a liver hemangioma.	general
But this is controversial.	general
If you're considering this type of medication, discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.	general
Hemifacial spasm is a nervous system disorder in which the muscles on one side of your face twitch involuntarily.	general
Hemifacial spasm is most often caused by a blood vessel touching a facial nerve, but it may be caused by a facial nerve injury or a tumor, or it may not have a cause.	general
Hemifacial spasm is most often caused by a blood vessel touching a facial nerve.	general

liver cirrhosis A normal liver (left) shows no signs of scarring.	general
In cirrhosis (right), scar tissue replaces normal liver tissue.	general
Hereditary hemochromatosis (he-moe-kroe-muh-TOE-sis) causes your body to absorb too much iron from the food you eat.	general
Excess iron is stored in your organs, especially your liver, heart and pancreas.	general
Too much iron can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as liver disease, heart problems and diabetes.	general
The genes that cause hemochromatosis are inherited, but only a minority of people who have the genes ever develop serious problems.	general
Signs and symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis usually appear in midlife.	general
Treatment includes regularly removing blood from your body.	general
Because much of the body's iron is contained in red blood cells, this treatment lowers iron levels.	general
Some people with hereditary hemochromatosis never have symptoms.	general
Early signs and symptoms often overlap with those of other common conditions.	general
Common symptoms include: Abdominal pain When signs and symptoms typically appear Hereditary hemochromatosis is present at birth.	general
But, most people don't experience signs and symptoms until later in life ‚Äî usually between the ages of 50 and 60 in men and after age 60 in women.	general
Women are more likely to develop symptoms after menopause, when they no longer lose iron with menstruation and pregnancy.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience any of the signs and symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis.	general
If you have an immediate family member who has hemochromatosis, ask your doctor about genetic tests that can determine if you have inherited the gene that increases your risk of hemochromatosis.	general
The liver is your largest internal organ.	general
About the size of a football, it's located mainly in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and above your stomach.	general
Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by a mutation in a gene that controls the amount of iron your body absorbs from the food you eat.	general
These mutations are passed from parents to children.	general
This type of hemochromatosis is by far the most common type.	general
Gene mutations that cause hemochromatosis A gene called HFE is most often the cause of hereditary hemochromatosis.	general
You inherit one HFE gene from each of your parents.	general
The HFEgene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D.	general
Genetic testing can reveal whether you have these mutations in your HFE gene.	general
you may develop hemochromatosis.	general
You can also pass the mutation on to your children.	general
But, not everyone who inherits two genes develops problems linked to the iron overload of hemochromatosis.	general
If you inherit 2 abnormal genes, you won't develop hemochromatosis.	general
You are considered a gene mutation carrier and can pass the mutation on to your children.	general
But, they wouldn't develop disease unless they also inherited another abnormal gene from the other parent.	general
If you inherit 1 abnormal gene, How hemochromatosis affects your organs Iron plays an essential role in several body functions, including helping in the formation of blood.	general
But, too much iron is toxic.	general
A hormone called hepcidin, secreted by the liver, normally controls how iron is used and absorbed in the body, as well as how excess iron is stored in various organs.	general
In hemochromatosis, the normal role of hepcidin is disrupted, causing your body to absorb more iron that it needs.	general
This excess iron is stored in major organs, especially your liver.	general
Over a period of years, the stored iron can cause severe damage that may lead to organ failure and chronic diseases, such as cirrhosis, diabetes and heart failure.	general
Though many people have faulty genes that cause hemochromatosis, only about 10 percent of them develop iron overload to a degree that causes tissue and organ damage.	general
Hereditary hemochromatosis isn't the only type of hemochromatosis.	general
Other types include: This causes the same problems in young people that hereditary hemochromatosis causes in adults.	general
But iron accumulation begins much earlier, and symptoms usually appear between the ages of 15 and 30.	general
This disorder is caused by mutations in the hemojuvelin or hepcidin genes.	general
Juvenile hemochromatosis.	general
In this severe disorder, iron builds up rapidly in the liver of the developing fetus.	general
It is thought to be an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself.	general
Neonatal hemochromatosis.	general
This form of the disease is not inherited and is often referred to as iron overload.	general
People with certain types of anemia or chronic liver disease may need multiple blood transfusions, which can lead to excess iron accumulation.	general
Secondary hemochromatosis.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of hereditary hemochromatosis include: This is the greatest risk factor for hereditary hemochromatosis.	general
Having 2 copies of a mutated HFE gene.	general
If you have a first-degree relative ‚Äî a parent or sibling ‚Äî with hemochromatosis, you're more likely to develop the disease.	general
Family history.	general
People of Northern European descent are more prone to hereditary hemochromatosis than are people of other ethnic backgrounds.	general
Hemochromatosis is less common in African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans.	general
Men are more likely than women to develop signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis at an earlier age.	general
Because women lose iron through menstruation and pregnancy, they tend to store less of the mineral than men do.	general
After menopause or a hysterectomy, the risk for women increases.	general
Complications Untreated, hereditary hemochromatosis can lead to a number of complications, especially in your joints and in organs where excess iron tends to be stored ‚Äî your liver, pancreas and heart.	general
Complications can include: Cirrhosis ‚Äî permanent scarring of the liver ‚Äî is just one of the problems that may occur.	general
Cirrhosis increases your risk of liver cancer and other life-threatening complications.	general
Liver problems.	general
Damage to the pancreas can lead to diabetes.	general
Pancreas problems.	general
Excess iron in your heart affects the heart's ability to circulate enough blood for your body's needs.	general
This is called congestive heart failure.	general
Hemochromatosis can also cause abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).	general
Heart problems.	general
Excess iron can lead to erectile dysfunction (impotence), and loss of sex drive in men and absence of the menstrual cycle in women.	general
Reproductive problems.	general
Deposits of iron in skin cells can make your skin appear bronze or gray in color.	general
Skin color changes.	general
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition that can occur when the small blood vessels in your kidneys become damaged and inflamed.	general
This damage can cause clots to form in the vessels.	general
The clots clog the filtering system in the kidneys and lead to kidney failure, which could be life-threatening.	general
Anyone can develop , but it is most common in young children.	general
In many cases, is caused by infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli (E.	general
coli) bacteria.	general
The first symptom of this form of is several days of diarrhea, which is often but not always bloody.	general
may also be caused by other infections, certain medications or conditions such as pregnancy, cancer or autoimmune disease.	general
In some cases, is the result of certain genetic mutations.	general
These forms of usually do not cause diarrhea.	general
.	general
is a serious condition.	general
But timely and appropriate treatment usually leads to a full recovery for most people, especially young children.	general
The signs and symptoms of may vary, depending on the cause.	general
Most cases of are caused by infection with certain strains of E. coli bacteria, which first affect the digestive tract.	general
The initial signs and symptoms of this form of may include: Diarrhea, which is often bloody Abdominal pain, cramping or bloating All forms of ‚Äî no matter the cause ‚Äî damage the blood vessels.	general
This damage causes red blood cells to break down (anemia), blood clots to form in the blood vessels and kidney damage.	general
Signs and symptoms of these changes include: Pale coloring, including loss of pink color in cheeks and inside the lower eyelids Extreme fatigue Unusual bleeding, such as bleeding from the nose and mouth Decreased urination or blood in the urine Swelling (edema) of the legs, feet or ankles, and less often in the face, hands, feet or entire body Confusion, seizures or stroke When to see a doctor See your doctor immediately if you or your child experiences bloody diarrhea or several days of diarrhea followed by: Decreased urine output Unexplained bruises Unusual bleeding Extreme fatigue Seek emergency care if you or your child doesn't urinate for 12 hours or more.	general
The most common cause of ‚Äî particularly in children under the age of 5 ‚Äî is infection with certain strains of E. coli bacteria.	general
E. coli refers to a group of bacteria normally found in the intestines of healthy humans and animals.	general
Most of the hundreds of types of E. coli are normal and harmless.	general
But some strains of E. coli cause diarrhea.	general
Some of the E.coli strains that cause diarrhea also produce a toxin called Shiga toxin.	general
These strains are called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC.	general
When you are infected with a strain of , the Shiga toxin can enter your bloodstream and cause damage to your blood vessels, which may lead to .	general
But most people who are infected with E. coli, even the more dangerous strains, don't develop .	general
Other causes of can include: Other infections, such as infection with pneumococcal bacteria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or influenza The use of certain medications, especially some of the medications used to treat cancer and some of the medications used to suppress the immune system of organ transplant recipients Rarely, may occur as a complication of pregnancy or health conditions such as autoimmune disease or cancer An uncommon type of ‚Äî known as atypical ‚Äî can be passed down genetically to children.	general
People who have inherited the mutated gene that causes this form of won't necessarily develop the condition.	general
But the mutated gene might be activated after exposure to a trigger, such as an infection, the use of certain medications or a chronic health condition.	general
Risk factors The majority of cases are caused by infection with certain strains of E. coli bacteria.	general
Exposure to E. coli can occur when you: Eat contaminated meat or produce Swim in pools or lakes contaminated with feces Have close contact with an infected person, such as within a family or at a child care center.	general
The risk of developing is highest for: Children 5 years of age or younger Adults 65 years of age or older People who have a weakened immune system People with certain genetic changes that make them more susceptible to Complications can cause life-threatening complications, including: Kidney failure, which can be sudden (acute) or develop over time (chronic) High blood pressure Stroke or seizures Heart problems Digestive tract problems, such as problems with the intestines, gallbladder or pancreas Meat or produce contaminated with E. coli won't necessarily look, feel or smell bad.	general
To protect against E. coli infection and other foodborne illnesses: Avoid unpasteurized milk, juice and cider.	general
Wash hands well before eating and after using the restroom and changing diapers.	general
Clean utensils and food surfaces often.	general
Cook meat to an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit.	general
Defrost meat in the microwave or refrigerator.	general
Keep raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods.	general
Don't place cooked meat on plates previously contaminated by raw meat.	general
Store meat below produce in the refrigerator to reduce the risk of liquids such as blood dripping on produce.	general
Avoid unclean swimming areas.	general
Don't swim if you have diarrhea.	general
Hemophilia is a rare disorder in which your blood doesn't clot normally because it lacks sufficient blood-clotting proteins (clotting factors).	general
If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time after an injury than you would if your blood clotted normally.	general
Small cuts usually aren't much of a problem.	general
If you have a severe deficiency of the clotting factor protein, the greater health concern is deep bleeding inside your body, especially in your knees, ankles and elbows.	general
That internal bleeding can damage your organs and tissues, and may be life-threatening.	general
Hemophilia is a genetic disorder.	general
Treatment includes regular replacement of the specific clotting factor that is reduced.	general
Signs and symptoms of hemophilia vary, depending on your level of clotting factors.	general
If your clotting-factor level is mildly reduced, you may bleed only after surgery or trauma.	general
If your deficiency is severe, you may experience spontaneous bleeding.	general
Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bleeding include: Unexplained and excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, or after surgery or dental work Many large or deep bruises Unusual bleeding after vaccinations Blood in your urine or stool Nosebleeds without a known cause In infants, unexplained irritability Bleeding into the brain A simple bump on the head can cause bleeding into the brain for some people who have severe hemophilia.	general
This rarely happens, but it's one of the most serious complications that can occur.	general
Signs and symptoms include: Painful, prolonged headache Seek emergency care if you or your child experiences: Signs or symptoms of bleeding into the brain An injury in which the bleeding won't stop Swollen joints that are hot to the touch and painful to bend If you have a family history of hemophilia, you may want to undergo genetic testing to see if you're a carrier of the disease before you start a family.	general
When you bleed, your body normally pools blood cells together to form a clot to stop the bleeding.	general
The clotting process is encouraged by certain blood particles.	general
Hemophilia occurs when you have a deficiency in one of these clotting factors.	general
There are several types of hemophilia, and most forms are inherited.	general
However, about 30% of people with hemophilia have no family history of the disorder.	general
In these people, an unexpected change occurs in one of the genes associated with hemophilia.	general
Acquired hemophilia is a rare variety of the condition that occurs when a person's immune system attacks clotting factors in the blood.	general
It can be associated with: Multiple sclerosis Hemophilia inheritance In the most common types of hemophilia, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome.	general
Everyone has two sex chromosomes, one from each parent.	general
A female inherits an X chromosome from her mother and an X chromosome from her father.	general
A male inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father.	general
This means that hemophilia almost always occurs in boys and is passed from mother to son through one of the mother's genes.	general
Most women with the defective gene are simply carriers and experience no signs or symptoms of hemophilia.	general
But some carriers can experience bleeding symptoms if their clotting factors are moderately decreased.	general
Risk factors The biggest risk factor for hemophilia is to have family members who also have the disorder.	general
Complications Complications of hemophilia may include: Bleeding that occurs in deep muscle can cause your limbs to swell.	general
The swelling may press on nerves and lead to numbness or pain.	general
Deep internal bleeding.	general
Internal bleeding may also put pressure on your joints, causing severe pain.	general
Left untreated, frequent internal bleeding may cause arthritis or destruction of the joint.	general
Damage to joints.	general
People with hemophilia are likelier to have blood transfusions, increasing their risk of receiving contaminated blood products.	general
Blood products became safer after the mid-1980s due to screening of donated blood for hepatitis and HIV.	general
In some people with severe hemophilia, the immune system has a negative reaction to the clotting factors used to treat bleeding.	general
When this happens, the immune system develops proteins (known as inhibitors) that inactivate the clotting factors, making treatment less effective.	general
Adverse reaction to clotting factor treatment.	general
Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in your lower rectum.	general
Internal hemorrhoids are usually painless, but tend to bleed.	general
External hemorrhoids may cause pain.	general
Hemorrhoids (HEM-uh-roids), also called piles, are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins.	general
Hemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).	general
Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time.	general
Hemorrhoids have a number of causes, but often the cause is unknown.	general
Fortunately, effective options are available to treat hemorrhoids.	general
Many people get relief with home treatments and lifestyle changes.	general
Signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids usually depend on the type of hemorrhoid.	general
External hemorrhoids These are under the skin around your anus.	general
Signs and symptoms might include: Itching or irritation in your anal region Pain or discomfort Internal hemorrhoids Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum.	general
You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort.	general
But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause: Painless bleeding during bowel movements.	general
You might notice small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet.	general
A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening (prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid), resulting in pain and irritation.	general
Thrombosed hemorrhoids If blood pools in an external hemorrhoid and forms a clot (thrombus), it can result in: Severe pain When to see a doctor If you have bleeding during bowel movements or you have hemorrhoids that don't improve after a week of home care, talk to your doctor.	general
Don't assume rectal bleeding is due to hemorrhoids, especially if you have changes in bowel habits or if your stools change in color or consistency.	general
Rectal bleeding can occur with other diseases, including colorectal cancer and anal cancer.	general
Seek emergency care if you have large amounts of rectal bleeding, lightheadedness, dizziness or faintness.	general
The veins around your anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell.	general
Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to: Straining during bowel movements Having chronic diarrhea or constipation Being obese Being pregnant Risk factors As you age, your risk of hemorrhoids increases.	general
That's because the tissues that support the veins in your rectum and anus can weaken and stretch.	general
This can also happen when you're pregnant, because the baby's weight puts pressure on the anal region.	general
Complications Complications of hemorrhoids are rare but include: Rarely, chronic blood loss from hemorrhoids may cause anemia, in which you don't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to your cells.	general
"If the blood supply to an internal hemorrhoid is cut off, the hemorrhoid may be ""strangulated,"" which can cause extreme pain."	general
Strangulated hemorrhoid.	general
Occasionally, a clot can form in a hemorrhoid (thrombosed hemorrhoid).	general
Although not dangerous, it can be extremely painful and sometimes needs to be lanced and drained.	general
Blood clot.	general
The best way to prevent hemorrhoids is to keep your stools soft, so they pass easily.	general
To prevent hemorrhoids and reduce symptoms of hemorrhoids, follow these tips: Eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains.	general
Doing so softens the stool and increases its bulk, which will help you avoid the straining that can cause hemorrhoids.	general
Add fiber to your diet slowly to avoid problems with gas.	general
Eat high-fiber foods.	general
Drink six to eight glasses of water and other liquids (not alcohol) each day to help keep stools soft.	general
Drink plenty of fluids.	general
Most people don't get enough of the recommended amount of fiber ‚Äî 20 to 30 grams a day ‚Äî in their diet.	general
Studies have shown that over-the-counter fiber supplements, such as psyllium (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel), improve overall symptoms and bleeding from hemorrhoids.	general
Consider fiber supplements.	general
If you use fiber supplements, be sure to drink at least eight glasses of water or other fluids every day.	general
Otherwise, the supplements can cause or worsen constipation.	general
Straining and holding your breath when trying to pass a stool creates greater pressure in the veins in the lower rectum.	general
Don't strain.	general
.	general
If you wait to pass a bowel movement and the urge goes away, your stool could dry out and be harder to pass.	general
Go as soon as you feel the urge Stay active to help prevent constipation and to reduce pressure on veins, which can occur with long periods of standing or sitting.	general
Exercise can also help you lose excess weight that might be contributing to your hemorrhoids.	general
Sitting too long, particularly on the toilet, can increase the pressure on the veins in the anus.	general
Avoid long periods of sitting.	general
Henoch-Schonlein purpura Henoch-Schonlein purpura Henoch-Schonlein purpura is an inflammation of the small blood vessels of the skin, joints, bowels and kidneys.	general
When blood vessels get inflamed, they can bleed into the skin, causing a reddish-purple rash (purpura).	general
Henoch-Schonlein purpura (also known as IgA vasculitis) is a disorder that causes the small blood vessels in your skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys to become inflamed and bleed.	general
The most striking feature of this form of vasculitis is a purplish rash, typically on the lower legs and buttocks.	general
Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also cause abdominal pain and aching joints.	general
Rarely, serious kidney damage can occur.	general
Henoch-Schonlein purpura can affect anyone, but it's most common in children between the ages of 2 and 6.	general
The condition usually improves on its own.	general
Medical care is generally needed if the disorder affects the kidneys.	general
The four main characteristics of Henoch-Schonlein purpura include: Reddish-purple spots that look like bruises develop on the buttocks, legs and feet.	general
The rash can also appear on the arms, face and trunk and may be worse in areas of pressure, such as the sock line and waistline.	general
Rash (purpura).	general
People with Henoch-Schonlein purpura often have pain and swelling around the joints ‚Äî mainly in the knees and ankles.	general
Joint pain sometimes precedes the classical rash by one or two weeks.	general
These symptoms subside when the disease clears and leave no lasting damage.	general
Swollen, sore joints (arthritis).	general
Many children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura develop belly pain, nausea, vomiting and bloody stools.	general
These symptoms sometimes occur before the rash appears.	general
Digestive tract symptoms.	general
Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also affect the kidneys.	general
In most cases, this shows up as protein or blood in the urine, which you may not even know is there unless you have a urine test done.	general
Usually this goes away once the illness passes, but some people develop persistent kidney disease.	general
Kidney involvement.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have Henoch-Schonlein purpura and it's causing serious problems with your digestive tract.	general
If your child develops the rash associated with this condition, see your doctor as soon as possible.	general
In Henoch-Schonlein purpura, some of the body's small blood vessels become inflamed, which can cause bleeding in the skin, abdomen and kidneys.	general
It's not clear why this initial inflammation develops.	general
It may be the result of the immune system responding inappropriately to certain triggers.	general
Nearly half the people who have Henoch-Schonlein purpura developed it after an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold.	general
Other triggers include chickenpox, strep throat, measles, hepatitis, certain medications, food, insect bites and exposure to cold weather.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of developing Henoch-Schonlein purpura include: The disease affects primarily children and young adults, with the majority of cases occurring in children between the ages of 2 and 6.	general
Henoch-Schonlein purpura is slightly more common in males than in females.	general
White and Asian children are more likely to develop Henoch-Schonlein purpura than are black children.	general
Complications For most people, symptoms improve within a month, leaving no lasting problems.	general
But recurrences are fairly common.	general
Complications associated with Henoch-Schonlein purpura include: The most serious complication of Henoch-Schonlein purpura is kidney damage.	general
This risk is greater in adults than in children.	general
Occasionally the damage is severe enough that dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.	general
Kidney damage.	general
In rare cases, Henoch-Schonlein purpura can cause intussusception ‚Äî a condition in which a section of the bowel folds into itself like a telescope, which prevents matter from moving through the bowel.	general
Bowel obstruction.	general
Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus.	general
The virus is one of several types of hepatitis viruses that cause inflammation and affect your liver's ability to function.	general
You're most likely to get hepatitis A from contaminated food or water or from close contact with a person or object that's infected.	general
Mild cases of hepatitis A don't require treatment.	general
Most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage.	general
Practicing good hygiene, including washing hands frequently, is one of the best ways to protect against hepatitis A. Vaccines are available for people most at risk.	general
Hepatitis A signs and symptoms typically don't appear until you've had the virus for a few weeks.	general
But not everyone with hepatitis A develops them.	general
If you do, hepatitis signs and symptoms can include: Sudden nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially on the upper right side beneath your lower ribs (by your liver) Clay-colored bowel movements Loss of appetite Low-grade fever Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) Intense itching These symptoms may be relatively mild and go away in a few weeks.	general
Sometimes, however, hepatitis A infection results in a severe illness that lasts several months.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of hepatitis A. Getting a hepatitis A vaccine or an injection of immunoglobulin (an antibody) within two weeks of exposure to hepatitis A may protect you from infection.	general
Ask your doctor or your local health department about receiving the hepatitis A vaccine if: You've traveled out of the country recently, particularly to Mexico or South or Central America, or to areas with poor sanitation A restaurant where you recently ate reports a hepatitis A outbreak Someone close to you, such as a roommate or caregiver, is diagnosed with hepatitis A You recently had sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that infects liver cells and causes inflammation.	general
The inflammation can affect how your liver works and cause other signs and symptoms of hepatitis A. The virus most commonly spreads when you eat or drink something contaminated with fecal matter, even just tiny amounts.	general
It does not spread through sneezing or coughing.	general
Here are some of the specific ways the hepatitis A virus can spread: Eating food handled by someone with the virus who doesn't thoroughly wash his or her hands after using the toilet Drinking contaminated water Eating raw shellfish from water polluted with sewage Being in close contact with a person who's infected ‚Äî even if that person has no signs or symptoms Having sex with someone who has the virus Risk factors You're at increased risk of hepatitis A if you: Travel or work in areas of the world where hepatitis A is common Attend child care or work in a child care center Live with another person who has hepatitis A Are a man who has sexual contact with other men Have any type of sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A Are HIV positive Are experiencing homelessness Have a clotting-factor disorder, such as hemophilia Use any type of illegal drugs (not just those that are injected) Complications Unlike other types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage, and it doesn't become chronic.	general
In rare cases, hepatitis A can cause a sudden loss of liver function, especially in older adults or people with chronic liver diseases.	general
Acute liver failure requires a stay in the hospital for monitoring and treatment.	general
Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant.	general
The hepatitis A vaccine can prevent infection with the virus.	general
The vaccine is typically given in two shots.	general
The first one is followed by a booster shot six months later.	general
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a hepatitis A vaccine for the following people: All children at age 1, or older children who didn't receive the childhood vaccine Anyone age 1 year or older who is experiencing homelessness Infants ages 6 to 11 months traveling internationally Family and caregivers of adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common People in direct contact with others who have hepatitis A Laboratory workers who may come in contact with hepatitis A Men who have sex with men People who work or travel in parts of the world where hepatitis A is common People who use any type of illicit drugs, not just injected ones People with clotting-factor disorders People with chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C Anyone wishing to obtain protection (immunity) If you're concerned about your risk of hepatitis A, ask your doctor if you should be vaccinated.	general
Follow safety precautions when traveling If you're traveling to parts of the world where hepatitis A outbreaks occur, take these steps to prevent infection: Peel and wash all fresh fruits and vegetables yourself.	general
Don't eat raw or undercooked meat and fish.	general
Drink bottled water and use it when brushing your teeth.	general
Avoid all beverages of unknown purity, with or without ice.	general
If bottled water isn't available, boil tap water before drinking it.	general
Practice good hygiene Thoroughly wash your hands often, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper and before preparing food or eating.	general
Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).	general
For some people, hepatitis B infection becomes chronic, meaning it lasts more than six months.	general
Having chronic hepatitis B increases your risk of developing liver failure, liver cancer or cirrhosis ‚Äî a condition that permanently scars of the liver.	general
Most adults with hepatitis B recover fully, even if their signs and symptoms are severe.	general
Infants and children are more likely to develop a chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis B infection.	general
A vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, but there's no cure if you have the condition.	general
If you're infected, taking certain precautions can help prevent spreading the virus to others.	general
Signs and symptoms of hepatitis B range from mild to severe.	general
They usually appear about one to four months after you've been infected, although you could see them as early as two weeks post-infection.	general
Some people, usually young children, may not have any symptoms.	general
Hepatitis B signs and symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Weakness and fatigue Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) When to see a doctor If you know you've been exposed to hepatitis B, contact your doctor immediately.	general
A preventive treatment may reduce your risk of infection if you receive the treatment within 24 hours of exposure to the virus.	general
If you think you have signs or symptoms of hepatitis B, contact your doctor.	general
Hepatitis B infection is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).	general
The virus is passed from person to person through blood, semen or other body fluids.	general
It does not spread by sneezing or coughing.	general
Common ways that HBV can spread are: You may get hepatitis B if you have unprotected sex with someone who is infected.	general
The virus can pass to you if the person's blood, saliva, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body.	general
Sexual contact.	general
HBV easily spreads through needles and syringes contaminated with infected blood.	general
Sharing IV drug paraphernalia puts you at high risk of hepatitis B. Sharing of needles.	general
Hepatitis B is a concern for health care workers and anyone else who comes in contact with human blood.	general
Accidental needle sticks.	general
Pregnant women infected with HBV can pass the virus to their babies during childbirth.	general
However, the newborn can be vaccinated to avoid getting infected in almost all cases.	general
Talk to your doctor about being tested for hepatitis B if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant.	general
Mother to child.	general
Acute vs.	general
chronic hepatitis B Hepatitis B infection may be either short-lived (acute) or long lasting (chronic).	general
lasts less than six months.	general
Your immune system likely can clear acute hepatitis B from your body, and you should recover completely within a few months.	general
Most people who get hepatitis B as adults have an acute infection, but it can lead to chronic infection.	general
Acute hepatitis B infection lasts six months or longer.	general
It lingers because your immune system can't fight off the infection.	general
Chronic hepatitis B infection may last a lifetime, possibly leading to serious illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.	general
Chronic hepatitis B infection The younger you are when you get hepatitis B ‚Äî particularly newborns or children younger than 5 ‚Äî the higher your risk of the infection becoming chronic.	general
Chronic infection may go undetected for decades until a person becomes seriously ill from liver disease.	general
Risk factors Hepatitis B spreads through contact with blood, semen or other body fluids from an infected person.	general
Your risk of hepatitis B infection increases if you: Have unprotected sex with multiple sex partners or with someone who's infected with HBV Share needles during IV drug use Are a man who has sex with other men Live with someone who has a chronic HBV infection Are an infant born to an infected mother Have a job that exposes you to human blood Travel to regions with high infection rates of HBV, such as Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa and Eastern Europe Complications Having a chronic HBV infection can lead to serious complications, such as: The inflammation associated with a hepatitis B infection can lead to extensive liver scarring (cirrhosis), which may impair the liver's ability to function.	general
Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis).	general
People with chronic hepatitis B infection have an increased risk of liver cancer.	general
Liver cancer.	general
Acute liver failure is a condition in which the vital functions of the liver shut down.	general
When that occurs, a liver transplant is necessary to sustain life.	general
Liver failure.	general
People with chronic hepatitis B may develop kidney disease or inflammation of blood vessels.	general
Other conditions.	general
The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as three or four injections over six months.	general
You can't get hepatitis B from the vaccine.	general
The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for: Children and adolescents not vaccinated at birth Those who work or live in a center for people who are developmentally disabled People who live with someone who has hepatitis B Health care workers, emergency workers and other people who come into contact with blood Anyone who has a sexually transmitted infection, including HIV Men who have sex with men People who have multiple sexual partners Sexual partners of someone who has hepatitis B People who inject illegal drugs or share needles and syringes People with chronic liver disease People with end-stage kidney disease Travelers planning to go to an area of the world with a high hepatitis B infection rate Take precautions to avoid HBV Other ways to reduce your risk of HBV include: Don't engage in unprotected sex unless you're absolutely certain your partner isn't infected with HBV or any other sexually transmitted infection.	general
Know the HBV status of any sexual partner.	general
if you don't know the health status of your partner.	general
Remember that although condoms can reduce your risk of contracting HBV, they don't eliminate the risk.	general
Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex If you use illicit drugs, get help to stop.	general
If you can't stop, use a sterile needle each time you inject illicit drugs.	general
Never share needles.	general
Don't use illegal drugs.	general
If you get a piercing or tattoo, look for a reputable shop.	general
Ask about how the equipment is cleaned.	general
Make sure the employees use sterile needles.	general
If you can't get answers, look for another shop.	general
Be cautious about body piercing and tattooing.	general
If you're traveling to a region where hepatitis B is common, ask your doctor about the hepatitis B vaccine in advance.	general
It's usually given in a series of three injections over a six-month period.	general
Ask about the hepatitis B vaccine before you travel.	general
The liver is your largest internal organ.	general
About the size of a football, it's located mainly in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and above your stomach.	general
Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation, sometimes leading to serious liver damage.	general
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contaminated blood.	general
Until recently, hepatitis C treatment required weekly injections and oral medications that many HCV-infected people couldn't take because of other health problems or unacceptable side effects.	general
That's changing.	general
Today, chronic is usually curable with oral medications taken every day for two to six months.	general
Still, about half of people with don't know they're infected, mainly because they have no symptoms, which can take decades to appear.	general
For that reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a one-time screening blood test for everyone at increased risk of the infection.	general
The largest group at risk includes everyone born between 1945 and 1965 ‚Äî a population five times more likely to be infected than those born in other years.	general
"Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus is known as chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C is usually a ""silent"" infection for many years, until the virus damages the liver enough to cause the signs and symptoms of liver disease."	general
Signs and symptoms include: Dark-colored urine Swelling in your legs Spiderlike blood vessels on your skin (spider angiomas) Every chronic hepatitis C infection starts with an acute phase.	general
Acute hepatitis C usually goes undiagnosed because it rarely causes symptoms.	general
When signs and symptoms are present, they may include jaundice, along with fatigue, nausea, fever and muscle aches.	general
Acute symptoms appear one to three months after exposure to the virus and last two weeks to three months.	general
Acute hepatitis C infection doesn't always become chronic.	general
Some people clear from their bodies after the acute phase, an outcome known as spontaneous viral clearance.	general
In studies of people diagnosed with acute , rates of spontaneous viral clearance have varied from 15% to 25%.	general
Acute hepatitis C also responds well to antiviral therapy.	general
Hepatitis C infection is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV).	general
The infection spreads when blood contaminated with the virus enters the bloodstream of an uninfected person.	general
Globally, exists in several distinct forms, known as genotypes.	general
Seven distinct genotypes and more than 67 subtypes have been identified.	general
The most common genotype in the United States is type 1.	general
Although chronic hepatitis C follows a similar course regardless of the genotype of the infecting virus, treatment recommendations vary depending on viral genotype.	general
More Information Your risk of hepatitis C infection is increased if you: Are a health care worker who has been exposed to infected blood, which may happen if an infected needle pierces your skin Have ever injected or inhaled illicit drugs Received a piercing or tattoo in an unclean environment using unsterile equipment Received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992 Received clotting factor concentrates before 1987 Received hemodialysis treatments for a long period of time Were born to a woman with a hepatitis C infection Were ever in prison Were born between 1945 and 1965, the age group with the highest incidence of hepatitis C infection Complications Normal liver vs.	general

The liver is your largest internal organ.	general
About the size of a football, it's located mainly in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and above your stomach.	general
Toxic hepatitis is an inflammation of your liver in reaction to certain substances to which you're exposed.	general
Toxic hepatitis can be caused by alcohol, chemicals, drugs or nutritional supplements.	general
In some cases, toxic hepatitis develops within hours or days of exposure to a toxin.	general
In other cases, it may take months of regular use before signs and symptoms appear.	general
The symptoms of toxic hepatitis often go away when exposure to the toxin stops.	general
But toxic hepatitis can permanently damage your liver, leading to irreversible scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and in some cases to liver failure, which can be life-threatening.	general
Mild forms of toxic hepatitis may not cause any symptoms and may be detected only by blood tests.	general
When signs and symptoms of toxic hepatitis occur, they may include: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Abdominal pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen When to see a doctor See your doctor right away if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
Overdoses of some medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), can lead to liver failure.	general
Get immediate medical care if you think an adult or a child has taken an overdose of acetaminophen.	general
Signs and symptoms of a possible acetaminophen overdose include: Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Upper abdominal pain If you suspect an acetaminophen overdose, immediately call 911, your local emergency services or, in the United States, a poison control center at 800-222-1222.	general
Do not wait for symptoms to develop.	general
An acetaminophen overdose can be fatal but can be successfully treated if addressed early after ingestion.	general
Toxic hepatitis occurs when your liver develops inflammation because of exposure to a toxic substance.	general
Toxic hepatitis may also develop when you take too much of a prescription or over-the-counter medication.	general
The liver normally removes and breaks down most drugs and chemicals from your bloodstream.	general
Breaking down toxins creates byproducts that can damage the liver.	general
Although the liver has a great capacity for regeneration, constant exposure to toxic substances can cause serious, sometimes irreversible harm.	general
Toxic hepatitis can be caused by: Heavy drinking over many years can lead to alcoholic hepatitis ‚Äî inflammation in the liver due to alcohol, which can lead to liver failure.	general
Nonprescription pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others) can damage your liver, especially if taken frequently or combined with alcohol.	general
Over-the-counter pain relievers.	general
Some medications linked to serious liver injury include the statin drugs used to treat high cholesterol, the combination drug amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), niacin (Niaspan), ketoconazole, certain antivirals and anabolic steroids.	general
There are many others.	general
Prescription medications.	general
Some herbs considered dangerous to the liver include aloe vera, black cohosh, cascara, chaparral, comfrey, kava and ephedra.	general
There are many others.	general
Children can develop liver damage if they mistake vitamin supplements for candy and take large doses.	general
Herbs and supplements.	general
Chemicals you may be exposed to on the job can cause liver injury.	general
Common chemicals that can cause liver damage include the dry cleaning solvent carbon tetrachloride, a substance called vinyl chloride (used to make plastics), the herbicide paraquat and a group of industrial chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls.	general
Industrial chemicals.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of toxic hepatitis include: Taking a medication or over-the-counter pain reliever that carries a risk of liver damage increases your risk of toxic hepatitis.	general
This is especially true if you take multiple medications or take more than the recommended dose of medication.	general
Taking over-the-counter pain relievers or certain prescription drugs.	general
Having a serious liver disorder such as cirrhosis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease makes you much more susceptible to the effects of toxins.	general
Having a liver disease.	general
Chronic infection with a hepatitis virus (hepatitis B, hepatitis C or one of the other ‚Äî extremely rare ‚Äî hepatitis viruses that may persist in the body) makes your liver more vulnerable.	general
Having hepatitis.	general
As you age, your liver breaks down harmful substances more slowly.	general
This means that toxins and their byproducts stay in your body longer.	general
Drinking alcohol while taking medications or certain herbal supplements increases the risk of toxicity.	general
Drinking alcohol.	general
Because women seem to metabolize certain toxins more slowly than men do, their livers are exposed to higher blood concentrations of harmful substances for a longer time.	general
This increases the risk of toxic hepatitis.	general
Being female.	general
Inheriting certain genetic mutations that affect the production and action of the liver enzymes that break down toxins may make you more susceptible to toxic hepatitis.	general
Having certain genetic mutations.	general
Working with certain industrial chemicals puts you at risk of toxic hepatitis.	general
Working with industrial toxins.	general
Complications Normal liver vs.	general
liver cirrhosis Normal liver vs.	general
liver cirrhosis A normal liver (left) shows no signs of scarring.	general
In cirrhosis (right), scar tissue replaces normal liver tissue.	general
The inflammation associated with toxic hepatitis can lead to liver damage and scarring.	general
Over time, this scarring, called cirrhosis, makes it difficult for your liver to do its job.	general
Eventually cirrhosis leads to liver failure.	general
The only treatment for chronic liver failure is to replace your liver with a healthy one from a donor (liver transplant).	general
Because it's not possible to know how you'll react to a particular medication, toxic hepatitis can't always be prevented.	general
But you may reduce your risk of liver problems if you: Take prescription and nonprescription drugs only when absolutely necessary.	general
Investigate nondrug options for common problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and arthritis pain.	general
Limit medications.	general
Follow the directions exactly for any drug you take.	general
Don't exceed the recommended amount, even if your symptoms don't seem to improve.	general
Because the effects of over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes wear off quickly, it's easy to take too much.	general
Take medications only as directed.	general
Don't assume that a natural product won't cause harm.	general
Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor before taking herbs and supplements.	general
The National Institutes of Health maintains the LiverTox website, where you can look up medications and supplements to see if they're linked to liver damage.	general
Be cautious with herbs and supplements.	general
Alcohol and medications are a bad combination.	general
If you're taking acetaminophen, don't drink alcohol.	general
Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the interaction between alcohol and other prescription and nonprescription drugs you use.	general
Don't mix alcohol and drugs.	general
If you work with or use hazardous chemicals, take all necessary precautions to protect yourself from exposure.	general
If you do come in contact with a harmful substance, follow the guidelines in your workplace, or call your local emergency services or your local poison control center for help.	general
Take precautions with chemicals.	general
Keep all medications and vitamin supplements away from children and in childproof containers so that children can't accidentally swallow them.	general
Keep medications and chemicals away from children.	general
Hepatocellular carcinoma Liver cancer Liver cancer Liver cancer begins in the cells of the liver.	general
The most common form of liver cancer begins in cells called hepatocytes and is called hepatocellular carcinoma.	general
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer.	general
Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs most often in people with chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.	general
Risk factors The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer, is higher in people with long-term liver diseases.	general
It's also higher if the liver is scarred by infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in people who drink large amounts of alcohol and who have an accumulation of fat in the liver.	general
to measure liver function Blood tests such as CT and MRI Imaging tests, in some cases, to remove a sample of liver tissue for laboratory testing Liver biopsy, Which treatment is best for you will depend on the size and location of your hepatocellular carcinoma, how well your liver is functioning, and your overall health.	general
Hepatocellular carcinoma treatments include: Surgery to remove the cancer and a margin of healthy tissue that surrounds it may be an option for people with early-stage liver cancers who have normal liver function.	general
Surgery to remove the entire liver and replace it with a liver from a donor may be an option in otherwise healthy people whose liver cancer hasn't spread beyond the liver.	general
Liver transplant surgery.	general
Ablation procedures to kill the cancer cells in the liver using extreme heat or cold may be recommended for people who can't undergo surgery.	general
These procedures include radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and ablation using alcohol or microwaves.	general
Destroying cancer cells with heat or cold.	general
Using a catheter that's passed through your blood vessels and into your liver, doctors can deliver chemotherapy drugs (chemoembolization) or tiny glass spheres containing radiation (radioembolization) directly to the cancer cells.	general
Delivering chemotherapy or radiation directly to cancer cells.	general
Radiation therapy using energy from X-rays or protons may be recommended if surgery isn't an option.	general
A specialized type of radiation therapy, called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), involves focusing many beams of radiation simultaneously at one point in your body.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Targeted drugs attack specific weaknesses in the cancer cells, and they may help slow the progression of the disease in people with advanced liver cancers.	general
Targeted drug therapy.	general
Immunotherapy drugs use your body's germ-fighting immune system to attack the cancer cells.	general
Immunotherapy may be an option for treating advanced liver cancer.	general

Hepatopulmonary (hep-uh-toe-POOL-moe-nar-e) syndrome is an uncommon condition that affects the lungs of people with advanced liver disease.	general
Hepatopulmonary syndrome is caused by blood vessels in the lungs expanding (dilating) and increasing in number, making it hard for red blood cells to properly absorb oxygen.	general
This leaves the lungs unable to deliver adequate amounts of oxygen to the body, which leads to low oxygen levels (hypoxemia).	general
Exactly how the liver disease is linked to the lung condition isn't yet clear.	general
A is the only cure for the syndrome.	general
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (tuh-lan-jee-uk-TAY-zhuh) is an inherited disorder that causes abnormal connections, called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), to develop between arteries and veins.	general
The most common locations affected are the nose, lungs, brain and liver.	general
These may enlarge over time and can bleed or rupture, sometimes causing catastrophic complications.	general
Spontaneous and unprovoked nosebleeds, sometimes on a daily basis, are the most common feature.	general
Persistent bleeding from the nose and the intestinal tract can result in severe iron deficiency anemia and poor quality of life.	general
Also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder that you inherit from your parents.	general
Its severity can vary greatly from person to person, even within the same family.	general
If you have , you may want to have your children checked for the disease because they can be affected even if they're not experiencing any symptoms.	general
Signs and symptoms of include: Nosebleeds, sometimes on a daily basis and often starting in childhood Lacy red vessels or tiny red spots, particularly on the lips, face, fingertips, tongue and inside surfaces of the mouth Iron deficiency anemia Shortness of breath is a genetic disorder you inherit from your parents.	general
It is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that if one of your parents has , you have a 50 percent chance of inheriting it.	general
If you have , each of your children has a 50 percent chance of inheriting it from you.	general
Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that increases your risk of colon cancer, endometrial cancer and several other cancers.	general
Lynch syndrome has historically been known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).	general
A number of inherited syndromes can increase your risk of colon cancer or endometrial cancer, but Lynch syndrome is the most common.	general
Doctors estimate that around 3 out of every 100 colon cancers or endometrial cancers are caused by Lynch syndrome.	general
Families that have Lynch syndrome usually have more instances of colon cancer or endometrial cancer than would typically be expected.	general
Lynch syndrome also causes cancers to occur at an earlier age than they might in the general population.	general
Products & Services People with Lynch syndrome may experience: Colon cancer that occurs at a younger age, especially before age 50 A family history of colon cancer that occurs at a young age A family history of cancer that affects the uterus (endometrial cancer) A family history of other related cancers, including ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, small intestine cancer, liver cancer, sweat gland cancer (sebaceous carcinoma) and other cancers When to see a doctor If you have concerns about your family history of colon or endometrial cancer, bring them up with your doctor.	general
Together, you and your doctor may consider having a genetic evaluation of your family history and your cancer risk.	general
If a family member has been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, tell your doctor.	general
Ask to be referred to a genetic counselor.	general
Genetic counselors are trained in genetics and counseling.	general
They can help you understand Lynch syndrome, what causes it and what type of care is recommended for people who have Lynch syndrome.	general
A genetic counselor can also help you sort through all the information about the disease and help you understand whether genetic testing is appropriate for you.	general
Lynch syndrome runs in families in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.	general
This means that if one parent carries a gene mutation for Lynch syndrome, there's a 50 percent chance that mutation will be passed on to each child.	general
The risk of Lynch syndrome is the same whether the gene mutation carrier is the mother or father or whether the child is a son or daughter.	general
How gene mutations cause cancer The genes affected in Lynch syndrome are responsible for correcting changes in the genetic code (mismatch repair genes).	general
Your genes contain DNA, which carries instructions for every chemical process in your body.	general
As your cells grow and divide, they make copies of their DNA and it's not uncommon for some minor mistakes to occur.	general
Normal cells have mechanisms to recognize mistakes and repair them.	general
But the cells of people who inherit one of the abnormal genes associated with Lynch syndrome lack the ability to repair these minor mistakes.	general
An accumulation of these mistakes leads to increasing genetic damage within cells and eventually can cause the cells to become cancerous.	general
Complications Beyond causing complications for your health, a genetic disorder such as Lynch syndrome may raise other concerns.	general
A genetic counselor is trained to help you navigate the areas of your life that may be affected by your diagnosis, such as: The results of your genetic test will be listed in your medical record, which may be accessed by insurance companies and employers.	general
You may have questions about whether being diagnosed with Lynch syndrome will make it difficult to change jobs or health insurance providers in the future.	general
A genetic counselor can explain the laws that may protect you.	general
Your privacy.	general
If you have Lynch syndrome, your children have a risk of inheriting your genetic mutations.	general
If one parent carries a genetic mutation for Lynch syndrome, each child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting that mutation.	general
A genetic counselor can help you develop a plan for discussing this with your children, including how and when to tell them and when they should consider testing.	general
Your children.	general
A Lynch syndrome diagnosis has implications for your entire family, as many other blood relatives may have a chance of having Lynch syndrome.	general
A genetic counselor can assist you in finding the best way to tell family members that you're having genetic testing and what that the results mean.	general
Your extended family.	general
Stickler syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause serious vision, hearing and joint problems.	general
Also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, Stickler syndrome is usually diagnosed during infancy or childhood.	general
Children who have Stickler syndrome often have distinctive facial features ‚Äî prominent eyes, a small nose with a scooped-out facial appearance and a receding chin.	general
They are often born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate).	general
While there is no cure for Stickler syndrome, treatments can help control symptoms and prevent complications.	general
In some cases, surgery may be needed to correct some of the physical abnormalities associated with Stickler syndrome.	general
Products & Services The signs and symptoms of Stickler syndrome ‚Äî and the severity of those signs and symptoms ‚Äî can vary widely from person to person, even within the same family.	general
In addition to having severe nearsightedness, children who have Stickler syndrome often experience cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachments.	general
Eye problems.	general
The extent of hearing loss varies among people who have Stickler syndrome.	general
It usually affects the ability to hear high frequencies.	general
Hearing difficulties.	general
Children who have Stickler syndrome often have overly flexible joints and are more likely to develop abnormal curvatures of the spine, such as scoliosis.	general
Osteoarthritis can begin in adolescence.	general
Bone and joint abnormalities.	general
When to see a doctor Regular follow-up visits, as well as yearly visits to doctors specializing in eye disorders, are crucial to monitor any progression of symptoms.	general
Early treatment can help prevent life-altering complications.	general
Hearing should be checked every six months in children through age 5 and then yearly thereafter.	general
Stickler syndrome is caused by mutations in certain genes involved in the formation of collagen ‚Äî one of the building blocks of many types of connective tissues.	general
The type of collagen most commonly affected is that used to produce joint cartilage and the jellylike material (vitreous) found within the eyes.	general
Risk factors Your child is more likely to be born with Stickler syndrome if either you or your partner has the disorder.	general
Complications Potential complications of Stickler syndrome include: Breathing or feeding difficulties may occur in babies born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), a small lower jaw and a tendency for the tongue to drop back toward the throat.	general
Difficulty breathing or feeding.	general
Blindness can occur if retinal detachments aren't repaired promptly.	general
Children with facial structure abnormalities associated with Stickler syndrome are more likely to develop ear infections than are children with normal facial structure.	general
Ear infections.	general
Hearing loss associated with Sticker syndrome may worsen with time.	general
Some people with Stickler syndrome may be at higher risk of heart valve problems.	general
Heart problems.	general
Most children who have Stickler syndrome have abnormally small jaws, so there often isn't enough room for the full complement of adult teeth.	general
Braces or, in some cases, dental surgeries may be necessary.	general
Dental problems.	general
Hiatal hernia Hiatal hernia A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach bulges through your diaphragm into your chest cavity.	general
A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach bulges through the large muscle separating your abdomen and chest (diaphragm).	general
Your diaphragm has a small opening (hiatus) through which your food tube (esophagus) passes before connecting to your stomach.	general
In a hiatal hernia, the stomach pushes up through that opening and into your chest.	general
A small hiatal hernia usually doesn't cause problems.	general
You may never know you have one unless your doctor discovers it when checking for another condition.	general
But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus, leading to heartburn.	general
Self-care measures or medications can usually relieve these symptoms.	general
A very large hiatal hernia might require surgery.	general
Most small hiatal hernias cause no signs or symptoms.	general
But larger hiatal hernias can cause: Backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus (acid reflux) Difficulty swallowing Shortness of breath Vomiting of blood or passing of black stools, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
A hiatal hernia occurs when weakened muscle tissue allows your stomach to bulge up through your diaphragm.	general
It's not always clear why this happens.	general
Inguinal hernia Inguinal hernia Inguinal hernias occur when part of the membrane lining the abdominal cavity (omentum) or intestine protrudes through a weak spot in the abdomen ‚Äî often along the inguinal canal, which carries the spermatic cord in men.	general
An inguinal hernia occurs when tissue, such as part of the intestine, protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles.	general
The resulting bulge can be painful, especially when you cough, bend over or lift a heavy object.	general
An inguinal hernia isn't necessarily dangerous.	general
It doesn't improve on its own, however, and can lead to life-threatening complications.	general
Your doctor is likely to recommend surgery to fix an inguinal hernia that's painful or enlarging.	general
Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure.	general
Inguinal hernia signs and symptoms include: A bulge in the area on either side of your pubic bone, which becomes more obvious when you're upright, especially if you cough or strain A burning or aching sensation at the bulge Pain or discomfort in your groin, especially when bending over, coughing or lifting A heavy or dragging sensation in your groin Weakness or pressure in your groin Occasionally, pain and swelling around the testicles when the protruding intestine descends into the scrotum Signs and symptoms in children Inguinal hernias in newborns and children result from a weakness in the abdominal wall that's present at birth.	general
Sometimes the hernia will be visible only when an infant is crying, coughing or straining during a bowel movement.	general
He or she might be irritable and have less appetite than usual.	general
In an older child, a hernia is likely to be more apparent when the child coughs, strains during a bowel movement or stands for a long period.	general
Signs of trouble If you aren't able to push the hernia in, the contents of the hernia may be trapped (incarcerated) in the abdominal wall.	general
An incarcerated hernia can become strangulated, which cuts off the blood flow to the tissue that's trapped.	general
A strangulated hernia can be life-threatening if it isn't treated.	general
Signs and symptoms of a strangulated hernia include: Nausea, vomiting or both A hernia bulge that turns red, purple or dark Inability to move your bowels or pass gas When to see a doctor Seek immediate care if a hernia bulge turns red, purple or dark or if you notice any other signs or symptoms of a strangulated hernia.	general
See your doctor if you have a painful or noticeable bulge in your groin on either side of your pubic bone.	general
The bulge is likely to be more noticeable when you're standing, and you usually can feel it if you put your hand directly over the affected area.	general
Some inguinal hernias have no apparent cause.	general
Others might occur as a result of: Increased pressure within the abdomen A pre-existing weak spot in the abdominal wall Straining during bowel movements or urination Strenuous activity Chronic coughing or sneezing In many people, the abdominal wall weakness that leads to an inguinal hernia occurs at birth when the abdominal lining (peritoneum) doesn't close properly.	general
Other inguinal hernias develop later in life when muscles weaken or deteriorate due to aging, strenuous physical activity or coughing that accompanies smoking.	general
Weaknesses can also occur in the abdominal wall later in life, especially after an injury or abdominal surgery.	general
In men, the weak spot usually occurs in the inguinal canal, where the spermatic cord enters the scrotum.	general
In women, the inguinal canal carries a ligament that helps hold the uterus in place, and hernias sometimes occur where connective tissue from the uterus attaches to tissue surrounding the pubic bone.	general
Risk factors Factors that contribute to developing an inguinal hernia include: Men are eight times more likely to develop an inguinal hernia than are women.	general
Being male.	general
Muscles weaken as you age.	general
Being older.	general
Being white.	general
You have a close relative, such as a parent or sibling, who has the condition.	general
Family history.	general
such as from smoking.	general
Chronic cough, Constipation causes straining during bowel movements.	general
Chronic constipation.	general
Being pregnant can weaken the abdominal muscles and cause increased pressure inside your abdomen.	general
Premature birth and low birth weight.	general
Even if your previous hernia occurred in childhood, you're at higher risk of developing another inguinal hernia.	general
Previous inguinal hernia or hernia repair.	general
Complications Complications of an inguinal hernia include: Most inguinal hernias enlarge over time if not repaired surgically.	general
In men, large hernias can extend into the scrotum, causing pain and swelling.	general
Pressure on surrounding tissues.	general
If the contents of the hernia become trapped in the weak point in the abdominal wall, it can obstruct the bowel, leading to severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and the inability to have a bowel movement or pass gas.	general
Incarcerated hernia.	general
An incarcerated hernia can cut off blood flow to part of your intestine.	general
Strangulation can lead to the death of the affected bowel tissue.	general
A strangulated hernia is life-threatening and requires immediate surgery.	general
Strangulation.	general
You can't prevent the congenital defect that makes you susceptible to an inguinal hernia.	general
You can, however, reduce strain on your abdominal muscles and tissues.	general
For example: Talk to your doctor about the best exercise and diet plan for you.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain fiber that can help prevent constipation and straining.	general
Emphasize high-fiber foods.	general
If you must lift something heavy, always bend from your knees ‚Äî not your waist.	general
Lift heavy objects carefully or avoid heavy lifting.	general
Besides its role in many serious diseases, smoking often causes a chronic cough that can lead to or aggravate an inguinal hernia.	general
Stop smoking.	general
Umbilical hernia Umbilical hernia An umbilical hernia creates a soft swelling or bulge near the navel.	general
It occurs when part of the intestine protrudes through the umbilical opening in the abdominal muscles.	general
Umbilical hernias in children are usually painless.	general
An umbilical hernia occurs when part of your intestine sticks out through the opening in your abdominal muscles through which your umbilical cord passed before you were born.	general
Umbilical hernias are common and typically harmless.	general
They are most common in infants, but they can affect adults as well.	general
In an infant, an umbilical hernia may be especially evident when the infant cries, causing the bellybutton to protrude.	general
This is a classic sign of an umbilical hernia.	general
Children's umbilical hernias often close on their own in the first two years of life, though some remain open into the fifth year or longer.	general
Umbilical hernias that appear during adulthood are more likely to need surgical repair.	general
An umbilical hernia creates a soft swelling or bulge near the navel (umbilicus).	general
In babies who have an umbilical hernia, the bulge may be visible only when they cry, cough or strain.	general
Umbilical hernias in children are usually painless.	general
Umbilical hernias that appear during adulthood may cause abdominal discomfort.	general
When to see a doctor If you suspect that your baby has an umbilical hernia, talk with the baby's pediatrician.	general
Seek emergency care if your baby has an umbilical hernia and: Appears to be in pain Begins to vomit Has tenderness, swelling or discoloration at the site of the hernia Similar guidelines apply to adults.	general
Talk with your doctor if you have a bulge near your navel.	general
Seek emergency care if the bulge becomes painful or tender.	general
Prompt diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications.	general
During gestation, the umbilical cord passes through a small opening in the baby's abdominal muscles.	general
The opening normally closes just after birth.	general
If the muscles don't join together completely in the midline of the abdominal wall, an umbilical hernia may appear at birth or later in life.	general
In adults, too much abdominal pressure contributes to umbilical hernias.	general
Causes of increased pressure in the abdomen include: Previous abdominal surgery Risk factors Umbilical hernias are most common in infants ‚Äî especially premature babies and those with low birth weights.	general
In the United States, African American infants appear to have a slightly increased risk of umbilical hernias.	general
The condition affects boys and girls equally.	general
For adults, being overweight or having multiple pregnancies may increase the risk of developing an umbilical hernia.	general
This type of hernia tends to be more common in women.	general
Complications For children, complications of an umbilical hernia are rare.	general
Complications can occur when the protruding abdominal tissue becomes trapped (incarcerated) and can no longer be pushed back into the abdominal cavity.	general
This reduces the blood supply to the section of trapped intestine and can lead to umbilical pain and tissue damage.	general
If the trapped portion of intestine is completely cut off from the blood supply (strangulated hernia), tissue death (gangrene) may occur.	general
Infection may spread throughout the abdominal cavity, causing a life-threatening situation.	general
Adults with umbilical hernias are somewhat more likely to experience incarceration or obstruction of the intestines.	general
Emergency surgery is typically required to treat these complications.	general
Herniated disk Herniated disk The rubbery disks that lie between the vertebrae in your spine consist of a soft center (nucleus) surrounded by a tougher exterior (annulus).	general
A herniated disk occurs when a portion of the nucleus pushes through a crack in the annulus.	general
Symptoms may occur if the herniation compresses a nerve.	general
A herniated disk refers to a problem with one of the rubbery cushions (disks) that sit between the individual bones (vertebrae) that stack to make your spine.	general
A spinal disk has a soft, jellylike center (nucleus) encased in a tougher, rubbery exterior (annulus).	general
Sometimes called a slipped disk or a ruptured disk, a herniated disk occurs when some of the nucleus pushes out through a tear in the annulus.	general
A herniated disk, which can occur in any part of the spine, can irritate a nearby nerve.	general
Depending on where the herniated disk is, it can result in pain, numbness or weakness in an arm or leg.	general
Many people have no symptoms from a herniated disk.	general
Surgery is usually not necessary to relieve the problem.	general
Products & Services Most herniated disks occur in the lower back, although they can also occur in the neck.	general
Signs and symptoms depend on where the disk is situated and whether the disk is pressing on a nerve.	general
They usually affect one side of the body.	general
If your herniated disk is in your lower back, you'll typically feel the most pain in your buttocks, thigh and calf.	general
You might have pain in part of the foot, as well.	general
If your herniated disk is in your neck, you'll typically feel the most pain in your shoulder and arm.	general
This pain might shoot into your arm or leg when you cough, sneeze or move into certain positions.	general
Pain is often described as sharp or burning.	general
Arm or leg pain.	general
People who have a herniated disk often have radiating numbness or tingling in the body part served by the affected nerves.	general
Numbness or tingling.	general
Muscles served by the affected nerves tend to weaken.	general
This can cause you to stumble, or affect your ability to lift or hold items.	general
You can have a herniated disk without symptoms.	general
You might not know you have it unless it shows up on a spinal image.	general
When to see a doctor Seek medical attention if your neck or back pain travels down your arm or leg, or if you also have numbness, tingling or weakness.	general
Disk herniation is most often the result of a gradual, aging-related wear and tear called disk degeneration.	general
As you age, your disks become less flexible and more prone to tearing or rupturing with even a minor strain or twist.	general
Most people can't pinpoint the cause of their herniated disk.	general
Sometimes, using your back muscles instead of your leg and thigh muscles to lift heavy objects can lead to a herniated disk, as can twisting and turning while lifting.	general
Rarely, a traumatic event such as a fall or a blow to the back is the cause.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of a herniated disk include: Excess body weight causes extra stress on the disks in your lower back.	general
People with physically demanding jobs have a greater risk of back problems.	general
Repetitive lifting, pulling, pushing, bending sideways and twisting also can increase your risk of a herniated disk.	general
Occupation.	general
Some people inherit a predisposition to developing a herniated disk.	general
It's thought that smoking lessens the oxygen supply to the disk, causing it to break down more quickly.	general
Complications Just above your waist, your spinal cord ends.	general
What continues through the spinal canal is a group of long nerve roots that resemble a horse's tail (cauda equina).	general
Rarely, disk herniation can compress the entire spinal canal, including all the nerves of the cauda equina.	general
Rarely, emergency surgery might be required to avoid permanent weakness or paralysis.	general
Seek emergency medical attention if you have: Pain, numbness or weakness can increase to the point that they hamper your daily activities.	general
Worsening symptoms.	general
Cauda equina syndrome can cause incontinence or difficulty urinating even with a full bladder.	general
Bladder or bowel dysfunction.	general
This progressive loss of sensation affects the areas that would touch a saddle ‚Äî the inner thighs, back of legs and the area around the rectum.	general
Saddle anesthesia.	general
Strengthening the trunk muscles stabilizes and supports the spine.	general
This reduces pressure on your spine and disks.	general
Keep your back straight and aligned, particularly when sitting for long periods.	general
Lift heavy objects properly, making your legs ‚Äî not your back ‚Äî do most of the work.	general
Maintain good posture.	general
Excess weight puts more pressure on the spine and disks, making them more susceptible to herniation.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
Avoid the use of any tobacco products.	general
Quit smoking.	general
Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash.	general
Although shingles can occur anywhere on your body, it most often appears as a single stripe of blisters that wraps around either the left or the right side of your torso.	general
Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus ‚Äî the same virus that causes chickenpox.	general
After you've had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue near your spinal cord and brain.	general
Years later, the virus may reactivate as shingles.	general
While it isn't a life-threatening condition, shingles can be very painful.	general
Vaccines can help reduce the risk of shingles, while early treatment can help shorten a shingles infection and lessen the chance of complications.	general
Shingles is characterized by pain or a tingling sensation in a limited area on one side of the face or torso, followed by a red rash with small, fluid-filled blisters.	general
The signs and symptoms of shingles usually affect only a small section of one side of your body.	general
These signs and symptoms may include: Pain, burning, numbness or tingling Sensitivity to touch A red rash that begins a few days after the pain Fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over Pain is usually the first symptom of shingles.	general
For some, it can be intense.	general
Depending on the location of the pain, it can sometimes be mistaken for a symptom of problems affecting the heart, lungs or kidneys.	general
Some people experience shingles pain without ever developing the rash.	general
Most commonly, the shingles rash develops as a stripe of blisters that wraps around either the left or right side of your torso.	general
Sometimes the shingles rash occurs around one eye or on one side of the neck or face.	general
When to see a doctor Contact your doctor promptly if you suspect shingles, but especially in the following situations: The pain and rash occur near an eye.	general
If left untreated, this infection can lead to permanent eye damage.	general
You're 60 or older, because age significantly increases your risk of complications.	general
You or someone in your family has a weakened immune system (due to cancer, medications or chronic illness).	general
Shingles affects the nerves Shingles affects the nerves The shingles rash is associated with an inflammation of nerves beneath the skin.	general
Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus ‚Äî the same virus that causes chickenpox.	general
Anyone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles.	general
After you recover from chickenpox, the virus can enter your nervous system and lie dormant for years.	general
Eventually, it may reactivate and travel along nerve pathways to your skin ‚Äî producing shingles.	general
But, not everyone who's had chickenpox will develop shingles.	general
The reason for shingles is unclear.	general
But it may be due to lowered immunity to infections as you grow older.	general
Shingles is more common in older adults and in people who have weakened immune systems.	general
Varicella-zoster is part of a group of viruses called herpes viruses, which includes the viruses that cause cold sores and genital herpes.	general
Because of this, shingles is also known as herpes zoster.	general
But the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles is not the same virus responsible for cold sores or genital herpes, a sexually transmitted infection.	general
Are you contagious?	general
A person with shingles can pass the varicella-zoster virus to anyone who isn't immune to chickenpox.	general
This usually occurs through direct contact with the open sores of the shingles rash.	general
Once infected, the person will develop chickenpox, however, not shingles.	general
Chickenpox can be dangerous for some people.	general
Until your shingles blisters scab over, you are contagious and should avoid physical contact with anyone who hasn't yet had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, especially people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and newborns.	general
Risk factors Anyone who has ever had chickenpox can develop shingles.	general
Most adults in the United States had chickenpox when they were children, before the advent of the routine childhood vaccination that now protects against chickenpox.	general
Factors that may increase your risk of developing shingles include: Shingles is most common in people older than 50.	general
The risk increases with age.	general
Some experts estimate that half the people age 80 and older will have shingles.	general
Being older than 50.	general
Diseases that weaken your immune system, such as HIV/AIDS and cancer, can increase your risk of shingles.	general
Having certain diseases.	general
Radiation or chemotherapy can lower your resistance to diseases and may trigger shingles.	general
Undergoing cancer treatments.	general
Drugs designed to prevent rejection of transplanted organs can increase your risk of shingles ‚Äî as can prolonged use of steroids, such as prednisone.	general
Taking certain medications.	general
Complications Complications from shingles can include: For some people, shingles pain continues long after the blisters have cleared.	general
This condition is known as postherpetic neuralgia, and it occurs when damaged nerve fibers send confused and exaggerated messages of pain from your skin to your brain.	general
Postherpetic neuralgia.	general
Shingles in or around an eye (ophthalmic shingles) can cause painful eye infections that may result in vision loss.	general
Vision loss.	general
Depending on which nerves are affected, shingles can cause an inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), facial paralysis, or hearing or balance problems.	general
Neurological problems.	general
If shingles blisters aren't properly treated, bacterial skin infections may develop.	general
Skin infections.	general
Two vaccines may help prevent shingles ‚Äî the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine and the shingles (varicella-zoster) vaccine.	general
Chickenpox vaccine The varicella vaccine (Varivax) has become a routine childhood immunization to prevent chickenpox.	general
The vaccine is also recommended for adults who've never had chickenpox.	general
Though the vaccine doesn't guarantee you won't get chickenpox or shingles, it can reduce your chances of complications and reduce the severity of the disease.	general
Shingles vaccine People looking to receive the shingles vaccine have two options: Zostavax and Shingrix.	general
Zostavax, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, has been shown to offer protection against shingles for about five years.	general
It's a live vaccine given as a single injection, usually in the upper arm.	general
Shingrix was approved by the FDA in 2017 and is the preferred alternative to Zostavax.	general
Studies suggest Shingrix offers protection against shingles beyond five years.	general
It's a nonliving vaccine made of a virus component, and is given in two doses, with two to six months between doses.	general
Shingrix is approved and recommended for people age 50 and older, including those who've previously received Zostavax.	general
Zostavax isn't recommended until age 60.	general
The most common side effects of either shingles vaccine are redness, pain, tenderness, swelling and itching at the injection site, and headaches.	general
As with the chickenpox vaccine, the shingles vaccine doesn't guarantee you won't get shingles.	general
But this vaccine will likely reduce the course and severity of the disease and reduce your risk of postherpetic neuralgia.	general
The shingles vaccine is used only as a prevention strategy.	general
It's not intended to treat people who currently have the disease.	general
Talk to your doctor about which option is right for you.	general
Facial nerve Facial nerve The nerve that controls your facial muscles passes through a narrow corridor of bone on its way to your face.	general
Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus) occurs when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near one of your ears.	general
In addition to the painful shingles rash, Ramsay Hunt syndrome can cause facial paralysis and hearing loss in the affected ear.	general
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox.	general
After chickenpox clears up, the virus still lives in your nerves.	general
Years later, it may reactivate.	general
When it does, it can affect your facial nerves.	general
Prompt treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome can reduce the risk of complications, which can include permanent facial muscle weakness and deafness.	general
Facial paralysis Facial paralysis Facial weakness or paralysis may cause one corner of your mouth to droop.	general
If you're experiencing facial weakness or paralysis, you may have trouble closing the eye on the affected side of your face.	general
The two main signs and symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome are: A painful red rash with fluid-filled blisters on, in and around one ear Facial weakness or paralysis on the same side as the affected ear Usually, the rash and the facial paralysis occur at the same time.	general
Sometimes one can happen before the other.	general
Other times, the rash never occurs.	general
If you have Ramsay Hunt syndrome, you might also experience: Hearing loss Difficulty closing one eye A change in taste perception or loss of taste Dry mouth and eyes When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you experience facial paralysis or a shingles rash on your face.	general
Treatment that starts within three days of the start of signs and symptoms may help prevent long-term complications.	general
Ramsay Hunt syndrome occurs in people who've had chickenpox.	general
Once you recover from chickenpox, the virus stays in your body ‚Äî sometimes reactivating in later years to cause shingles, a painful rash with fluid-filled blisters.	general
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a shingles outbreak that affects the facial nerve near one of your ears.	general
It can also causes one-sided facial paralysis and hearing loss.	general
Risk factors Ramsay Hunt syndrome can occur in anyone who has had chickenpox.	general
It's more common in older adults, typically affecting people older than 60.	general
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is rare in children.	general
Ramsay Hunt syndrome isn't contagious.	general
However, reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus can cause chickenpox in people who haven't previously had chickenpox or been vaccinated for it.	general
The infection can be serious for people who have immune system problems.	general
Until the rash blisters scab over, avoid physical contact with: Anyone who's never had chickenpox or who's never had the chickenpox vaccine Anyone who has a weak immune system Complications of Ramsay Hunt syndrome may include: For most people, the hearing loss and facial paralysis associated with Ramsay Hunt syndrome is temporary.	general
However, it can become permanent.	general
Permanent hearing loss and facial weakness.	general
The facial weakness caused by Ramsay Hunt syndrome may make it difficult for you to close your eyelid.	general
When this happens, the cornea, which protects your eye, can become damaged.	general
This damage can cause eye pain and blurred vision.	general
Eye damage.	general
This painful condition occurs when a shingles infection damages nerve fibers.	general
The messages sent by these nerve fibers become confused and exaggerated, causing pain that may last long after other signs and symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome have faded.	general
Postherpetic neuralgia.	general
Children are now routinely vaccinated against chickenpox, which greatly reduces the chances of becoming infected with the chickenpox virus.	general
A shingles vaccine for people age 50 or older also is recommended.	general
Hiccups: What causes them Hiccups: What causes them Hiccups are caused by involuntary contractions of your diaphragm ‚Äî the muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen and plays an important role in breathing.	general
This involuntary contraction causes your vocal cords to close very briefly, which produces the characteristic sound of a hiccup.	general
Hiccups are involuntary contractions of the diaphragm ‚Äî the muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen and plays an important role in breathing.	general
"Each contraction is followed by a sudden closure of your vocal cords, which produces the characteristic ""hic"" sound."	general
Hiccups may result from a large meal, alcoholic or carbonated beverages or sudden excitement.	general
In some cases, hiccups may be a sign of an underlying medical condition.	general
For most people, a bout of hiccups usually lasts only a few minutes.	general
Rarely, hiccups may persist for months.	general
This can result in weight loss and exhaustion.	general
Hiccupping is a symptom.	general
It may sometimes be accompanied by a slight tightening sensation in your chest, abdomen or throat.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment to see your doctor if your hiccups last more than 48 hours or if they are so severe that they cause problems with eating, sleeping or breathing.	general
The most common triggers for hiccups that last less than 48 hours include: Drinking carbonated beverages Swallowing air with chewing gum or sucking on candy Hiccups that last more than 48 hours may be caused by a variety of factors, which can be grouped into the following categories.	general
Nerve damage or irritation A cause of long-term hiccups is damage to or irritation of the vagus nerves or phrenic nerves, which serve the diaphragm muscle.	general
Factors that may cause damage or irritation to these nerves include: A hair or something else in your ear touching your eardrum A tumor, cyst or goiter in your neck Gastroesophageal reflux Sore throat or laryngitis Central nervous system disorders A tumor or infection in your central nervous system or damage to your central nervous system as a result of trauma can disrupt your body's normal control of the hiccup reflex.	general
Examples include: Encephalitis Barbiturates Risk factors Men are much more likely to develop long-term hiccups than are women.	general
Other factors that may increase your risk of hiccups include: Anxiety, stress and excitement have been associated with some cases of short-term and long-term hiccups.	general
Mental or emotional issues.	general
Some people develop hiccups after undergoing general anesthesia or after procedures that involve abdominal organs.	general
Hidradenitis suppurativa Hidradenitis suppurativa Hidradenitis suppurativa usually appears as one or more red, tender bumps that fill with pus.	general
It most commonly occurs in the armpits (shown), groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts.	general
Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh) is a skin condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin.	general
The lumps can break open, or tunnels can form under the skin.	general
The condition mostly affects areas where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts.	general
Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty.	general
It can persist for many years and worsen over time, with serious effects on your daily life and emotional well-being.	general
Medications and surgery can help manage symptoms and prevent complications.	general
Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one spot or multiple areas of the body.	general
"Signs and symptoms of the condition include: Small pitted areas of skin containing blackheads ‚Äî often appearing in pairs or a ""double-barreled"" pattern ‚Äî are a common feature."	general
Blackheads.	general
The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months.	general
Later more bumps form.	general
They usually appear in areas with hair follicles with many oil and sweat glands, such as the armpits, groin and anal area.	general
They also occur where skin rubs together, such as the inner thighs, breast and buttocks.	general
Painful pea-sized lumps.	general
Over time, tracts connecting the lumps may form under the skin.	general
These wounds heal very slowly, if at all, and can leak pus, which may have an odor.	general
Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms.	general
Excess weight, stress, hormonal changes, heat or humidity may worsen symptoms.	general
In women, the disease severity may lessen after menopause.	general
When to see a doctor Early detection of hidradenitis suppurativa is key to getting effective treatment.	general
See your doctor if your condition: Returns within weeks of treatment Appears in several locations Flares often If you've already received a diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa, keep in mind that the warning signs of a disease flare are often similar to those that occurred originally.	general
Also pay attention to any new signs or symptoms.	general
These may indicate either a flare or a complication of treatment.	general
You may need to see a specialist in skin conditions (dermatologist) or a surgeon for long-term care.	general
More Information The exact cause of hidradenitis suppurativa isn't known.	general
It develops when hair follicles in the skin become blocked.	general
Experts think it could be connected to hormones, inherited genes and immune system problems.	general
Smoking, excess weight and metabolic syndrome also might play a role.	general
Hidradenitis suppurativa is not caused by an infection or being unclean, and it can't be spread to other people.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your chance of developing hidradenitis suppurativa include: Hidradenitis suppurativa most commonly occurs in women between the ages of 18 and 29.	general
People who develop the condition at an early age may be at increased risk of developing more widespread disease.	general
Women are more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa than are men.	general
A tendency to develop hidradenitis suppurativa can be inherited.	general
Family history.	general
Several studies have shown a relationship between being overweight and hidradenitis suppurativa.	general
Smoking tobacco has been linked to hidradenitis suppurativa.	general
Complications Persistent and severe hidradenitis suppurativa often causes complications, including: The affected area is susceptible to infection.	general
The wounds may heal but leave rope-like scars or pitted skin.	general
Scars and skin changes.	general
Sores and scar tissue may cause limited or painful movement, especially when the disease affects the armpits or thighs.	general
Restricted movement.	general
The most common sites for hidradenitis suppurativa also contain many lymph nodes.	general
Scar tissue can interfere with the lymph drainage system, which may result in swelling in the arms, legs or genitals.	general
Obstructed lymph drainage.	general
The location, drainage and odor of the sores can cause embarrassment and reluctance to go out in public, leading to sadness or depression.	general
Social isolation.	general
High blood pressure (hypertension) in children is blood pressure that's the same as or higher than 95 percent of children who are the same sex, age and height as your child.	general
There isn't a simple target blood pressure reading that indicates high blood pressure in all children because what's considered normal changes as children grow.	general
High blood pressure in children younger than 6 years old is usually caused by another medical condition.	general
Older children can develop high blood pressure for the same reasons adults do ‚Äî excess weight, poor nutrition and lack of exercise.	general
Lifestyle changes, such as eating a heart-healthy diet and exercising more, can help reduce high blood pressure in children.	general
But for some children, medications may be necessary.	general
High blood pressure usually doesn't cause symptoms.	general
However, signs and symptoms that might indicate a high blood pressure emergency () include: hypertensive crisis Shortness of breath If your child has any of these symptoms, seek emergency medical care.	general
When to see a doctor Your child's blood pressure should be checked during routine well-check appointments starting at age 3, and at every appointment if your child is found to have high blood pressure.	general
If your child has a condition that can increase the risk of high blood pressure ‚Äî including premature birth, low birth weight, congenital heart disease and certain kidney problems ‚Äî blood pressure checks might begin in infancy.	general
If you're concerned about your child having a risk factor for high blood pressure, such as being overweight or obese, talk to your child's doctor.	general
High blood pressure in younger children is often related to other health conditions such as heart defects, kidney disease, genetic conditions or hormonal disorders.	general
Older children ‚Äî especially those who are overweight ‚Äî are more likely to have primary hypertension.	general
This type occurs on its own, without an underlying condition.	general
Risk factors Your child's risk factors for high blood pressure depend on health conditions, genetics and lifestyle factors.	general
Primary (essential) hypertension Primary hypertension occurs on its own, without an identifiable cause.	general
This type of high blood pressure occurs more often in older children, generally age 6 and older.	general
The risk factors for developing primary hypertension include: Being overweight or obese Having a family history of high blood pressure Having type 2 diabetes or a high fasting blood sugar level Having high cholesterol Being sedentary Secondary hypertension Secondary hypertension is caused by another condition.	general
It's more common in young children.	general
Other causes of high blood pressure include: Chronic kidney disease Polycystic kidney disease Heart problems, such as severe narrowing (coarctation) of the aorta Adrenal disorders Narrowing of the artery to the kidney (renal artery stenosis) Sleep disorders, especially obstructive sleep apnea Certain medications, such as decongestants, oral contraceptives and steroids Drugs, such as cocaine Complications Children who have high blood pressure are likely to continue to have high blood pressure as adults unless they begin treatment.	general
If your child's high blood pressure continues into adulthood, your child could be at risk of: High blood pressure can be prevented in children by making the same lifestyle changes that can help treat it ‚Äî controlling your child's weight, providing a healthy diet and encouraging your child to exercise.	general
High blood pressure caused by another condition can sometimes be controlled, or even prevented, by managing the condition that's causing it.	general
Secondary hypertension (secondary high blood pressure) is high blood pressure that's caused by another medical condition.	general
Secondary hypertension can be caused by conditions that affect your kidneys, arteries, heart or endocrine system.	general
Secondary hypertension can also occur during pregnancy.	general
Secondary hypertension differs from the usual type of high blood pressure (primary hypertension or essential hypertension), which is often referred to simply as high blood pressure.	general
Primary hypertension has no clear cause and is thought to be linked to genetics, poor diet, lack of exercise and obesity.	general
Proper treatment of secondary hypertension can often control both the underlying condition and the high blood pressure, which reduces the risk of serious complications ‚Äî including heart disease, kidney failure and strokes.	general
Products & Services Like primary hypertension, secondary hypertension usually has no specific signs or symptoms, even if your blood pressure has reached dangerously high levels.	general
If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, having any of these signs may mean your condition is secondary hypertension: High blood pressure that doesn't respond to blood pressure medications (resistant hypertension) Very high blood pressure ‚Äî systolic blood pressure over 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure over 120 mm Hg High blood pressure that no longer responds to medication that previously controlled your blood pressure Sudden-onset high blood pressure before age 30 or after age 55 No family history of high blood pressure When to see a doctor If you have a condition that can cause secondary hypertension, you may need your blood pressure checked more frequently.	general
Ask your doctor how often to have your blood pressure checked.	general
A number of conditions can cause secondary hypertension.	general
Several kidney diseases may cause secondary hypertension, including: Diabetes can damage your kidneys' filtering system, which can lead to high blood pressure.	general
Diabetes complications (diabetic nephropathy).	general
In this inherited condition, cysts in your kidneys prevent the kidneys from working normally and can raise blood pressure.	general
Polycystic kidney disease.	general
Your kidneys filter waste and sodium using microscopic-sized filters called glomeruli that can sometimes become swollen.	general
If the swollen glomeruli can't work normally, you may develop high blood pressure.	general
Glomerular disease.	general
This type of hypertension is caused by narrowing (stenosis) of one or both arteries leading to your kidneys.	general
Renovascular hypertension.	general
Renovascular hypertension is often caused by the same type of fatty plaques that can damage your coronary arteries (atherosclerosis) or a separate condition in which the muscle and fibrous tissues of the renal artery wall thicken and harden into rings (fibromuscular dysplasia).	general
This condition can cause irreversible kidney damage.	general
Medical conditions affecting hormone levels may also cause secondary hypertension.	general
These conditions may include: In this condition, corticosteroid medications may cause secondary hypertension, or hypertension may be caused by a pituitary tumor or other factors that cause the adrenal glands to produce too much of the hormone cortisol.	general
Cushing syndrome.	general
In this condition, a tumor in one or both of the adrenal glands, increased growth of normal cells in one or both of the adrenal glands or other factors cause the adrenal glands to release an excessive amount of the hormone aldosterone.	general
This makes your kidneys retain salt and water and lose too much potassium, which raises blood pressure.	general
Aldosteronism.	general
This rare tumor, usually found in an adrenal gland, increases production of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, which can lead to long-term high blood pressure or short-term spikes in blood pressure.	general
Pheochromocytoma.	general
When the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), high blood pressure can result.	general
Thyroid problems.	general
The parathyroid glands regulate levels of calcium and phosphorus in your body.	general
If the glands secrete too much parathyroid hormone, the amount of calcium in your blood rises ‚Äî which triggers a rise in blood pressure.	general
Hyperparathyroidism.	general
Other possible causes of secondary hypertension include: With this defect that's generally present at birth, the body's main artery (aorta) is narrowed (coarctation).	general
This forces the heart to pump harder to get blood through the aorta and to the rest of your body.	general
This, in turn, raises blood pressure ‚Äî particularly in your arms.	general
Coarctation of the aorta.	general
In this condition, often marked by severe snoring, breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, causing you to not get enough oxygen.	general
Sleep apnea.	general
Not getting enough oxygen may damage the lining of the blood vessel walls, which may make your blood vessels less effective in regulating your blood pressure.	general
In addition, sleep apnea causes part of the nervous system to be overactive and release certain chemicals that increase blood pressure.	general
As you gain weight, the amount of blood circulating through your body increases.	general
This puts added pressure on your artery walls, increasing your blood pressure.	general
Excess weight often is associated with an increase in heart rate and a reduction in the capacity of your blood vessels to transport blood.	general
In addition, fat deposits can release chemicals that raise blood pressure.	general
All of these factors can cause hypertension.	general
Pregnancy can make existing high blood pressure worse, or may cause high blood pressure to develop (pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia).	general
Various prescription medications ‚Äî such as pain relievers, birth control pills, antidepressants and drugs used after organ transplants ‚Äî can cause or aggravate high blood pressure in some people.	general
Medications and supplements.	general
Over-the-counter decongestants and certain herbal supplements, including ginseng, licorice and ephedra (ma-huang), may have the same effect.	general
Many illegal drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, also increase blood pressure.	general
Risk factors The greatest risk factor for having secondary hypertension is having a medical condition that can cause high blood pressure, such as kidney, artery, heart or endocrine system problems.	general
Complications Secondary hypertension can worsen the underlying medical condition you have that's causing your high blood pressure.	general
If you don't receive treatment, secondary hypertension can also be associated with other medical conditions, such as: This can result in hardening and thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), which can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other complications.	general
Damage to your arteries.	general
Increased blood pressure can cause your blood vessels to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm.	general
If an aneurysm ruptures, it can be life-threatening.	general
To pump blood against the higher pressure in your vessels, your heart muscle thickens.	general
Eventually, the thickened muscle may have a hard time pumping enough blood to meet your body's needs, which can lead to heart failure.	general
Heart failure.	general
This can prevent these organs from functioning normally.	general
Weakened and narrowed blood vessels in your kidneys.	general
This can result in vision loss.	general
Thickened, narrowed or torn blood vessels in the eyes.	general
"This syndrome is a cluster of disorders of your body's metabolism ‚Äî including increased waist circumference, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol), high blood pressure and high insulin levels."	general
Metabolic syndrome.	general
If you have high blood pressure, you're more likely to have other components of metabolic syndrome.	general
The more components you have, the greater your risk of developing diabetes, heart disease or stroke.	general
Uncontrolled high blood pressure also may affect your ability to think, remember and learn.	general
Trouble with memory or understanding concepts is more common in people who have high blood pressure.	general
Trouble with memory or understanding.	general
Priapism is a prolonged erection of the penis.	general
The persistent erection continues hours beyond or isn't caused by sexual stimulation.	general
Priapism is usually painful.	general
Although priapism is an uncommon condition overall, it occurs commonly in certain groups, such as people who have sickle cell anemia.	general
Prompt treatment for priapism is usually needed to prevent tissue damage that could result in the inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction).	general
Priapism most commonly affects men in their 30s and older.	general
Priapism symptoms vary depending on the type of priapism.	general
The two main types of priapism are ischemic and nonischemic priapism.	general
Ischemic priapism Ischemic priapism, also called low-flow priapism, is the result of blood not being able to leave the penis.	general
It's the more common type of priapism.	general
Signs and symptoms include: Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft Progressive penile pain Recurrent or stuttering priapism, a form of ischemic priapism, is an uncommon condition.	general
It's more common in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell anemia).	general
Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis.	general
Recurrent priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism.	general
In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more frequent and more prolonged erections.	general
Nonischemic priapism Nonischemic priapism, also known as high-flow priapism, occurs when penile blood flow isn't regulated appropriately.	general
Nonischemic priapism is usually less painful than ischemic priapism.	general
Signs and symptoms include: Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Erect but not fully rigid penile shaft When to see a doctor If you have an erection lasting more than four hours, you need emergency care.	general
The emergency room doctor will determine whether you have ischemic priapism or nonischemic priapism.	general
This is necessary because the treatment for each is different, and treatment for ischemic priapism needs to be done as soon as possible.	general
If you experience recurrent, persistent, painful erections that resolve on their own, see your doctor.	general
You might need treatment to prevent further episodes.	general
An erection normally occurs in response to physical or psychological stimulation.	general
This stimulation causes certain smooth muscles to relax, increasing blood flow to spongy tissues in the penis.	general
Consequently, the blood-filled penis becomes erect.	general
After stimulation ends, the blood flows out and the penis returns to its nonrigid (flaccid) state.	general
Priapism occurs when some part of this system ‚Äî the blood, blood vessels, smooth muscles or nerves ‚Äî changes normal blood flow, and an erection persists.	general
The underlying cause of priapism often can't be determined, but several conditions may play a role.	general
Blood disorders Sickle cell anemia Other hematologic dyscrasias, such as thalassemia, multiple myeloma and others The most common associated diagnosis in children is sickle cell anemia.	general
Prescription medications Priapism, usually ischemic priapism, is a possible side effect of a number of drugs, including: Medications injected directly into the penis to treat erectile dysfunction, such as alprostadil, papaverine, phentolamine and others Antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and sertraline Alpha blockers including prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin and tamsulosin Medications used to treat anxiety or psychotic disorders, such as hydroxyzine, risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), lithium, clozapine, chlorpromazine and thioridazine Blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and heparin Hormones such as testosterone or gonadotropin-releasing hormone Medications used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as atomoxetine (Strattera) Alcohol and drug use Alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and other illicit drug abuse can cause priapism, particularly ischemic priapism.	general
A common cause of nonischemic priapism ‚Äî a persistent erection caused by excessive blood flow into the penis ‚Äî is trauma or injury to your penis, pelvis or perineum, the region between the base of the penis and the anus.	general
Other factors A spider bite, scorpion sting or other toxic infections Metabolic disorders including gout or amyloidosis Neurogenic disorders, such as a spinal cord injury or syphilis Cancers involving the penis Complications Ischemic priapism can cause serious complications.	general
The blood trapped in the penis is deprived of oxygen.	general
When an erection lasts for too long, this oxygen-poor blood can begin to damage or destroy tissues in the penis.	general
As a result, untreated priapism can cause erectile dysfunction.	general
Gallbladder and bile duct Gallbladder and bile duct The gallbladder serves as a reservoir for bile, a yellow-green fluid produced in your liver.	general
Bile flows from your liver into your gallbladder, where it's held until needed during the digestion of food.	general
When you eat, your gallbladder releases bile into the bile duct, where it's carried to the upper part of the small intestine (duodenum) to help break down fat in food.	general
Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is a type of bile duct cancer that occurs in the bile ducts that lead out of the liver (hepatic ducts) and join with the gallbladder.	general
Hilar cholangiocarcinomas are also known as Klatskin tumors.	general
such as a CT and MRI Imaging tests, for very high levels of CA 19-9 tumor maker using ERCP and specialized lab testing with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Doctors typically don't recommend collecting cells using a needle inserted through your skin and into your bile duct (transperitoneal biopsy).	general
This technique increases the risk of cancer recurrence and may make you ineligible for a liver transplant.	general
Which treatment is best for you will depend on the location and extent of your hilar cholangiocarcinoma.	general
Treatment typically involves surgery, liver transplant or supportive treatments to reduce your pain and other symptoms.	general
Nearby lymph nodes The surgeon then connects the remaining bile ducts to the small intestine so that bile can still reach your digestive tract and help digest food.	general
Liver transplant People with early-stage hilar cholangiocarcinoma who aren't able to undergo surgery may consider liver transplant.	general
Chemotherapy and radiation are typically used before the liver transplant in order to kill as many cancer cells as possible before surgery.	general
This treatment typically involves: Intravenous chemotherapy with a medicine that makes your cells more vulnerable to radiation External beam radiation therapy Internal radiation (brachytherapy) using small wires that are placed near the cancer and slowly release radiation Chemotherapy in pill form until transplant surgery Minimally invasive surgery to look for signs that cancer has spread Liver transplant with a donor liver if one becomes available You may undergo routine tests to evaluate your health while waiting for a liver transplant to make sure you're healthy enough for the surgery.	general
Chemotherapy People with advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma who aren't able to undergo surgery or liver transplant may receive chemotherapy to slow the growth of the cancer.	general
Hip labral tear Hip labral tear Hip labral tears are more common in people who play certain sports or who have structural abnormalities of the hip.	general
If conservative treatments don't help, your doctor may suggest surgery to remove or repair the torn labrum.	general
A hip labral tear involves the ring of cartilage (labrum) that follows the outside rim of the socket of your hip joint.	general
In addition to cushioning the hip joint, the labrum acts like a rubber seal or gasket to help hold the ball at the top of your thighbone securely within your hip socket.	general
Athletes who participate in such sports as ice hockey, soccer, football, golf and ballet are at higher risk of developing a hip labral tear.	general
Structural abnormalities of the hip also can lead to a hip labral tear.	general
Products & Services Many hip labral tears cause no signs or symptoms.	general
Occasionally, however, you may experience one or more of the following: A locking, clicking or catching sensation in your hip joint Pain in your hip or groin Stiffness or limited range of motion in your hip joint When to see a doctor Seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or don't improve within six weeks.	general
The cause of a hip labral tear may be: Injury to or dislocation of the hip joint ‚Äî which can occur during car accidents or from playing contact sports such as football or hockey ‚Äî can cause a hip labral tear.	general
Some people are born with hip problems that can accelerate wear and tear of the joint and eventually cause a hip labral tear.	general
Structural abnormalities.	general
Sports-related and other physical activities ‚Äî including the sudden twisting or pivoting motions common in golf or softball ‚Äî can lead to joint wear and tear that ultimately results in a hip labral tear.	general
Repetitive motions.	general
Complications A hip labral tear may predispose you to develop osteoarthritis in that joint in the future.	general
Hip labral tears are often associated with sports participation.	general
If your sport puts a lot of strain on your hips, condition the surrounding muscles with strength and flexibility exercises.	general
Try to avoid loading your hip with your full body weight when your legs are in positions at the extreme ends of your hip's normal range of motion.	general
Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by breathing in spores of a fungus often found in bird and bat droppings.	general
Histoplasmosis is most commonly transmitted when these spores become airborne, often during cleanup or demolition projects.	general
Soil contaminated by bird or bat droppings also can transmit histoplasmosis, so farmers and landscapers are at a higher risk of contracting the disease.	general
In the United States, histoplasmosis commonly occurs in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, though it can occur in other areas, too.	general
Most people with histoplasmosis never develop symptoms and aren't aware they're infected.	general
But for some people ‚Äî primarily infants and those with compromised immune systems ‚Äî histoplasmosis can be serious.	general
Effective treatments are available for even the most severe forms of histoplasmosis.	general
Several types of histoplasmosis exist.	general
The mildest form produces no signs or symptoms, but severe infections can be life-threatening.	general
When signs and symptoms do occur, they usually appear three to 17 days after exposure and may include: Muscle aches Chest discomfort In some people, histoplasmosis can also produce joint pain and a rash.	general
People who have an underlying lung disease, such as emphysema, may develop a chronic form of histoplasmosis.	general
Signs of chronic histoplasmosis may include weight loss and a cough that brings up blood.	general
The symptoms of chronic histoplasmosis sometimes can mimic those of tuberculosis.	general
Severe histoplasmosis The most severe variety of histoplasmosis occurs primarily in infants and in people with compromised immune systems.	general
Called disseminated histoplasmosis, this variety can affect nearly any part of your body, including your mouth, liver, central nervous system, skin and adrenal glands.	general
If untreated, disseminated histoplasmosis is usually fatal.	general
When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if you develop flu-like symptoms after being exposed to bird or bat droppings ‚Äî especially if you have a weakened immune system.	general
Histoplasmosis is caused by the reproductive cells (spores) of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.	general
The spores are extremely light and float into the air when dirt or other contaminated material is disturbed.	general
Even if you've had histoplasmosis in the past, you can still get the infection again.	general
However, if you contract histoplasmosis again, the illness will likely be milder than the initial infection.	general
The histoplasmosis fungus thrives in damp soil that's rich in organic material, especially the droppings from birds and bats.	general
For that reason, it's particularly common in chicken and pigeon coops, old barns, caves and parks.	general
Histoplasmosis isn't contagious, so it can't be spread from person to person.	general
Risk factors The chances of developing histoplasmosis symptoms increase with the number of spores you inhale.	general
Professions with a higher likelihood of spore exposure include: Most at risk of severe infection Children younger than age 2 and adults age 55 and older have weaker immune systems, so they're more likely to develop disseminated histoplasmosis ‚Äî the most serious form of the disease.	general
Other factors that can weaken your immune system include: HIV or AIDS Intensive cancer chemotherapy Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, often used to control rheumatoid arthritis Medications that prevent rejection of organ transplants Complications Histoplasmosis can cause a number of serious complications, even in otherwise healthy people.	general
For infants, older adults and people with compromised immune systems, the potential problems are often life-threatening.	general
Complications can include: Histoplasmosis can damage lungs to the point that the air sacs begin filling with fluid.	general
This prevents efficient air exchange and can deplete oxygen levels in the blood.	general
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	general
Inflammation of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds your heart, is called pericarditis.	general
When the fluid in this sac increases, it can interfere with the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently.	general
Heart problems.	general
Histoplasmosis can harm your adrenal glands, which produce hormones that give instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in your body.	general
Adrenal insufficiency.	general
In some cases, histoplasmosis can cause meningitis, an infection and inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain and spinal cord.	general
Meningitis.	general
It's difficult to prevent exposure to the fungus that causes histoplasmosis, especially in areas where the disease is widespread.	general
Even so, these steps may help reduce the risk of infection: Avoid projects and activities that might expose you to the fungus, such as cave exploring and raising birds, such as pigeons or chickens.	general
Avoid exposure.	general
Before you dig soil or work in an area that could harbor the fungus that causes histoplasmosis, spray it thoroughly with water.	general
This can help prevent spores from being released into the air.	general
Spraying chicken coops and barns before cleaning them also can reduce your risk.	general
Spray contaminated surfaces.	general
Wear a respirator mask.	general
Consult the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to determine which type of mask will provide adequate protection for your level of exposure.	general
Use an effective face mask.	general
How speech occurs How speech occurs Speech occurs when air flows from the lungs, up the windpipe (trachea) and through the voice box (larynx).	general
This causes the vocal cords to vibrate, creating sound.	general
Sound is shaped into words by the muscles controlling the soft palate, tongue and lips.	general
Vocal cords open and closed Vocal cords open and closed Laryngitis is an inflammation of your voice box (larynx) from overuse, irritation or infection.	general
Inside the larynx are your vocal cords ‚Äî two folds of mucous membrane covering muscle and cartilage.	general
Normally, your vocal cords open and close smoothly, forming sounds through their movement and vibration.	general
But with laryngitis, your vocal cords become inflamed or irritated.	general
This swelling causes distortion of the sounds produced by air passing over them.	general
As a result, your voice sounds hoarse.	general
In some cases of laryngitis, your voice can become almost undetectable.	general
Laryngitis may be short-lived (acute) or long lasting (chronic).	general
Most cases of laryngitis are triggered by a temporary viral infection or vocal strain and aren't serious.	general
Persistent hoarseness can sometimes signal a more serious underlying medical condition.	general
In most cases laryngitis symptoms last less than a couple of weeks and are caused by something minor, such as a virus.	general
Less often, laryngitis symptoms are caused by something more serious or long lasting.	general
Laryngitis signs and symptoms can include: Tickling sensation and rawness of your throat Sore throat When to see a doctor You can manage most acute cases of laryngitis with self-care steps, such as resting your voice and drinking plenty of fluids.	general
Strenuous use of your voice during an episode of acute laryngitis can damage your vocal cords.	general
Make an appointment with a doctor if your laryngitis symptoms last more than two weeks.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if you: Have trouble breathing Cough up blood Have increasing pain Have trouble swallowing Makes noisy, high-pitched breathing sounds when inhaling (stridor) Drools more than usual Has a fever higher than 103 F (39.	general
4 C) These signs and symptoms may indicate croup ‚Äî inflammation of the larynx and the airway just beneath it.	general
Although croup can usually be treated at home, severe symptoms require medical attention.	general
These symptoms can also indicate epiglottitis, an inflammation of the tissue that acts as a lid (epiglottis) to cover the windpipe (trachea), which can be life-threatening for children and adults.	general
Acute laryngitis Most cases of laryngitis are temporary and improve after the underlying cause gets better.	general
Causes of acute laryngitis include: Viral infections similar to those that cause a cold Vocal strain, caused by yelling or overusing your voice Bacterial infections, such as diphtheria, although this is rare, in large part due to increasing rates of vaccination Chronic laryngitis Laryngitis that lasts longer than three weeks is known as chronic laryngitis.	general
This type of laryngitis is generally caused by exposure to irritants over time.	general
Chronic laryngitis can cause vocal cord strain and injuries or growths on the vocal cords (polyps or nodules).	general
These injuries can be caused by: Inhaled irritants, such as chemical fumes, allergens or smoke Acid reflux, also called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Chronic sinusitis Excessive alcohol use Habitual overuse of your voice (such as with singers or cheerleaders) Bacterial or fungal infections Infections with certain parasites Vocal cord paralysis, which can result from injury, a stroke, a lung tumor or other health conditions Bowing of the vocal cords in old age Risk factors Risk factors for laryngitis include: such as a cold, bronchitis or sinusitis Having a respiratory infection, such as cigarette smoke, excessive alcohol intake, stomach acid or workplace chemicals Exposure to irritating substances, by speaking too much, speaking too loudly, shouting or singing Overusing your voice, Complications In some cases of laryngitis caused by infection, the infection may spread to other parts of the respiratory tract.	general
To prevent dryness or irritation to your vocal cords: Smoke dries your throat and irritates your vocal cords.	general
Don't smoke, and avoid secondhand smoke.	general
These cause you to lose total body water.	general
Limit alcohol and caffeine.	general
Fluids help keep the mucus in your throat thin and easy to clear.	general
Drink plenty of water.	general
Spicy foods can cause stomach acid to move into the throat or esophagus, causing heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).	general
Avoid eating spicy foods.	general
These foods contain vitamins A, E and C, and help keep the mucous membranes that line the throat healthy.	general
Include whole grains, fruits and vegetables in your diet.	general
This does more harm than good, because it causes an abnormal vibration of your vocal cords and can increase swelling.	general
Clearing your throat also causes your throat to secrete more mucus and feel more irritated, making you want to clear your throat again.	general
Avoid clearing your throat.	general
Wash your hands often, and avoid contact with people who have upper respiratory infections such as colds.	general
Avoid upper respiratory infections.	general
A sty is a bacterial infection involving one or more of the small glands near the base of your eyelashes.	general
It is similar to a boil or a pimple and is often painful.	general
A sty is a red, painful lump near the edge of your eyelid that may look like a boil or a pimple.	general
Sties are often filled with pus.	general
A sty usually forms on the outside of your eyelid.	general
But sometimes it can form on the inner part of your eyelid.	general
In most cases, a sty will begin to disappear on its own in a couple days.	general
In the meantime, you may be able to relieve the pain or discomfort of a sty by applying a warm washcloth to your eyelid.	general
Signs and symptoms of a sty include: A red lump on your eyelid that is similar to a boil or a pimple Eyelid pain Eyelid swelling Another condition that causes inflammation of the eyelid is a chalazion.	general
A chalazion occurs when there's a blockage in one of the small oil glands at the margin of the eyelid, just behind the eyelashes.	general
Unlike a sty, a chalazion usually isn't painful and tends to be most prominent on the inner side of the eyelid.	general
Treatment for both conditions is similar.	general
When to see a doctor Most sties are harmless to your eye and won't affect your ability to see clearly.	general
Try self-care measures first, such as applying a warm washcloth to your closed eyelid for 5 to 10 minutes several times a day and gently massaging the eyelid.	general
Contact your doctor if: The sty doesn't start to improve after 48 hours Redness and swelling extend beyond your eyelid and involve your cheek or other parts of your face A sty is caused by an infection of oil glands in the eyelid.	general
The bacterium staphylococcus is responsible for most of these infections.	general
Risk factors You are at increased risk of a sty if you: Touch your eyes with unwashed hands Insert your contact lenses without thoroughly disinfecting them or washing your hands first Leave on eye makeup overnight Use old or expired cosmetics Have blepharitis, a chronic inflammation along the edge of the eyelid Have rosacea, a skin condition characterized by facial redness To prevent eye infections: Wash your hands with soap and warm water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer several times each day.	general
Keep your hands away from your eyes.	general
Wash your hands.	general
Reduce your risk of recurrent eye infections by throwing away old cosmetics.	general
Don't share your cosmetics with others.	general
Don't wear eye makeup overnight.	general
Take care with cosmetics.	general
If you wear contact lenses, wash your hands thoroughly before handling your contacts and follow your doctor's advice on disinfecting them.	general
Make sure your contact lenses are clean.	general
If you've had a sty before, using a compress regularly may help prevent it from coming back.	general
Apply warm compresses.	general
If you have blepharitis, follow your doctor's instructions for caring for your eyes.	general
Manage blepharitis.	general
Horner syndrome signs Horner syndrome signs Decreased eye pupil size is a key sign of Horner syndrome.	general
Horner syndrome is a combination of signs and symptoms caused by the disruption of a nerve pathway from the brain to the face and eye on one side of the body.	general
Typically, Horner syndrome results in a decreased pupil size, a drooping eyelid and decreased sweating on the affected side of your face.	general
Horner syndrome is the result of another medical problem, such as a stroke, tumor or spinal cord injury.	general
In some cases, no underlying cause can be found.	general
There's no specific treatment for Horner syndrome, but treatment for the underlying cause may restore normal nerve function.	general
Horner syndrome is also known as Horner-Bernard syndrome or oculosympathetic palsy.	general
Horner syndrome usually affects only one side of the face.	general
Common signs and symptoms include: A persistently small pupil (miosis) A notable difference in pupil size between the two eyes (anisocoria) Little or delayed opening (dilation) of the affected pupil in dim light Drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis) Slight elevation of the lower lid, sometimes called upside-down ptosis Sunken appearance to the eye Little or no sweating (anhidrosis) either on the entire side of the face or an isolated patch of skin on the affected side Signs and symptoms, particularly ptosis and anhidrosis, may be subtle and difficult to detect.	general
Additional signs and symptoms in children with Horner syndrome may include: Lighter iris color in the affected eye of a child under the age of 1 Lack of redness (flushing) on the affected side of the face that would normally appear from heat, physical exertion or emotional reactions When to see a doctor A number of factors, some more serious than others, can cause Horner syndrome.	general
It is important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis.	general
Get emergency care if signs or symptoms associated with Horner syndrome appear suddenly, appear after a traumatic injury, or are accompanied by other signs or symptoms, such as: Impaired vision Horner syndrome is caused by damage to a certain pathway in the sympathetic nervous system.	general
The sympathetic nervous system regulates heart rate, pupil size, perspiration, blood pressure and other functions that enable you to respond quickly to changes in your environment.	general
The nerve pathway affected in Horner syndrome is divided into three groups of nerve cells (neurons).	general
First-order neurons This neuron pathway leads from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, passes through the brainstem and extends into the upper portion of the spinal cord.	general
Problems in this region that can disrupt nerve function related to Horner syndrome include: Diseases that cause the loss of the protective sheath on neurons (myelin) Neck trauma Second-order neurons This neuron path extends from the spinal column, across the upper part of the chest and into the side of the neck.	general
Causes related to nerve damage in this region may include: Lung cancer Tumor of the myelin sheath (schwannoma) Damage to the main blood vessel leading from the heart (aorta) Surgery in the chest cavity Traumatic injury Third-order neurons This neuron path extends along the side of the neck and leads to the facial skin and muscles of the iris and eyelids.	general
Nerve damage in this region may be associated with the following: Damage to the carotid artery along the side of the neck Damage to the jugular vein along the side of the neck Tumor or infection near the base of the skull Cluster headaches, a disorder that results in cylical patterns of severe headaches The most common causes of Horner syndrome in children include: Injury to the neck or shoulders during delivery Defect of the aorta present at birth Tumor of the hormonal and nervous systems (neuroblastoma) Unknown causes In some cases the cause of Horner syndrome cannot be identified.	general
This is known as idiopathic Horner syndrome.	general
Hot flashes are sudden feelings of warmth, which are usually most intense over the face, neck and chest.	general
Your skin might redden, as if you're blushing.	general
Hot flashes can also cause sweating, and if you lose too much body heat, you might feel chilled afterward.	general
Although other medical conditions can cause them, hot flashes most commonly are due to menopause ‚Äî the time when menstrual periods become irregular and eventually stop.	general
In fact, hot flashes are the most common symptom of the menopausal transition.	general
How often hot flashes occur varies among women and can range from a few a week to several an hour.	general
There are a variety of treatments for particularly bothersome hot flashes.	general
Products & Services During a hot flash, you might have: A sudden feeling of warmth spreading through your upper body and face A flushed appearance with red, blotchy skin Rapid heartbeat A chilled feeling as the hot flash lets up Hot flashes can vary in frequency and intensity.	general
How long symptoms last varies greatly.	general
On average, symptoms persist for more than seven years.	general
Some women have them for more than 10 years.	general
When to see a doctor If hot flashes become particularly bothersome, consider seeing your doctor to discuss treatment options.	general
The cause of hot flashes isn't known, but it's likely related to several factors.	general
These include changes in reproductive hormones and in your body's thermostat (hypothalamus), which becomes more sensitive to slight changes in body temperature.	general
Risk factors Not all women who go through menopause have hot flashes, and it's not clear why some women do have them.	general
Factors that may increase your risk include: Women who smoke are more likely to get hot flashes.	general
A high body mass index (BMI) is associated with a higher frequency of hot flashes.	general
More African-American women report menopausal hot flashes than do women of European descent.	general
Hot flashes are less common in women of Japanese and Chinese descent than in white European women.	general
Complications Nighttime hot flashes (night sweats) can wake you from sleep and, over time, can cause chronic insomnia.	general
There is some association with hot flashes and increased risk of heart disease and bone loss.	general
HPV infection is a viral infection that commonly causes skin or mucous membrane growths (warts).	general
There are more than 100 varieties of human papillomavirus (HPV).	general
Some types of HPV infection cause warts, and some can cause different types of cancer.	general
Most HPV infections don't lead to cancer.	general
But some types of genital HPV can cause cancer of the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina (cervix).	general
Other types of cancers, including cancers of the anus, penis, vagina, vulva and back of the throat (oropharyngeal), have been linked to HPV infection.	general
These infections are often transmitted sexually or through other skin-to-skin contact.	general
Vaccines can help protect against the strains of HPV most likely to cause genital warts or cervical cancer.	general
Common warts Common warts Common warts can grow on your hands or fingers.	general
They're small, grainy bumps that are rough to the touch.	general
They're usually flesh-colored, white, pink or tan.	general
Plantar warts Plantar warts Plantar warts are caused by the same type of virus that causes warts on your hands and fingers.	general
But, because of their location, they can be painful.	general
Flat warts are smaller and smoother than other warts.	general
They generally occur on the face or legs and are more common in children and teens than in adults.	general
Female genital warts Female genital warts Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection.	general
They can appear on the genitals, in the pubic area or in the anal canal.	general
In women, genital warts can also grow inside the vagina.	general
Male genital warts Male genital warts Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection.	general
They can appear on the genitals, in the pubic area or in the anal canal.	general
In most cases, your body's immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts.	general
When warts do appear, they vary in appearance depending on which kind of HPV is involved: These appear as flat lesions, small cauliflower-like bumps or tiny stemlike protrusions.	general
In women, genital warts appear mostly on the vulva but can also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina.	general
Genital warts.	general
In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus.	general
Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender.	general
Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps and usually occur on the hands and fingers.	general
In most cases, common warts are simply unsightly, but they can also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding.	general
Common warts.	general
Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of your feet.	general
These warts might cause discomfort.	general
Plantar warts.	general
Flat warts are flat-topped, slightly raised lesions.	general
They can appear anywhere, but children usually get them on the face and men tend to get them in the beard area.	general
Women tend to get them on the legs.	general
Flat warts.	general
Cervical cancer Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, but cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an HPV infection.	general
The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause noticeable symptoms.	general
Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is your best protection from cervical cancer.	general
Because early cervical cancer doesn't cause symptoms, it's vital that women have regular screening tests to detect any precancerous changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer.	general
Current guidelines recommend that women ages 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years.	general
Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five years if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time.	general
Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no abnormal results.	general
When to see a doctor If you or your child has warts of any kind that cause embarrassment, discomfort or pain, seek advice from your doctor.	general
HPV infection occurs when the virus enters your body, usually through a cut, abrasion or small tear in your skin.	general
The virus is transferred primarily by skin-to-skin contact.	general
Genital HPV infections are contracted through sexual intercourse, anal sex and other skin-to-skin contact in the genital region.	general
Some HPV infections that result in oral or upper respiratory lesions are contracted through oral sex.	general
If you're pregnant and have an HPV infection with genital warts, it's possible your baby may get the infection.	general
Rarely, the infection may cause a noncancerous growth in the baby's voice box (larynx).	general
Warts are contagious.	general
They can spread through direct contact with a wart.	general
Warts can also spread when someone touches something that already touched a wart.	general
Risk factors HPV infections are common.	general
Risk factors for HPV infection include: The more sexual partners you have, the more likely you are to contract a genital HPV infection.	general
Having sex with a partner who has had multiple sex partners also increases your risk.	general
Number of sexual partners.	general
Common warts occur mostly in children.	general
Genital warts occur most often in adolescents and young adults.	general
People who have weakened immune systems are at greater risk of HPV infections.	general
Immune systems can be weakened by HIV/AIDS or by immune system-suppressing drugs used after organ transplants.	general
Weakened immune systems.	general
Areas of skin that have been punctured or opened are more prone to develop common warts.	general
Damaged skin.	general
Touching someone's warts or not wearing protection before contacting surfaces that have been exposed to HPV ‚Äî such as public showers or swimming pools ‚Äî might increase your risk of HPV infection.	general
Personal contact.	general
Complications Some HPV infections cause lesions on your tongue, tonsils, soft palate, or within your larynx and nose.	general
Oral and upper respiratory lesions.	general
Certain strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer.	general
These strains might also contribute to cancers of the genitals, anus, mouth and upper respiratory tract.	general
Common warts It's difficult to prevent HPV infections that cause common warts.	general
If you have a common wart, you can prevent the spread of the infection and formation of new warts by not picking at a wart and not biting your nails.	general
Plantar warts To reduce the risk of contracting HPV infections that cause plantar warts, wear shoes or sandals in public pools and locker rooms.	general
Genital warts You can reduce your risk of developing genital warts and other HPV-related genital lesions by: Being in a mutually monogamous sexual relationship Reducing your number of sex partners Using a latex condom, which can reduce your risk of HPV transmission HPV vaccines Three HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.	general
The most recent was Gardasil 9, which is approved for use in males and females ages 9 to 45 to protect against cervical cancer and genital warts.	general
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine HPV vaccination for girls and boys ages 11 and 12, although it can be given as early as age 9.	general
It's ideal for girls and boys to receive the vaccine before they have sexual contact and are exposed to HPV.	general
Research has shown that receiving the vaccine at a young age isn't linked to an earlier start of sexual activity.	general
Once someone is infected with HPV, the vaccine might not be as effective or might not work at all.	general
Also, response to the vaccine is better at younger ages than older ones.	general
But, if given before someone is infected, the vaccine can prevent most cases of cervical cancer.	general
The CDC now recommends that all 11- and 12-year-olds receive two doses of HPV vaccine at least six months apart, instead of the previously recommended three-dose schedule.	general
Younger adolescents ages 9 and 10 and teens ages 13 and 14 also are able to receive vaccination on the updated two-dose schedule.	general
Research has shown that the two-dose schedule is effective for children under 15.	general
Teens and young adults who begin the vaccine series later, at ages 15 through 26, should continue to receive three doses of the vaccine.	general
The CDC now recommends catch-up HPV vaccinations for all people through age 26 who aren't adequately vaccinated.	general

An increased front-to-back curve of the upper spine is called kyphosis.	general
Kyphosis is an exaggerated, forward rounding of the back.	general
It can occur at any age but is most common in older women.	general
Age-related kyphosis is often due to weakness in the spinal bones that causes them to compress or crack.	general
Other types of kyphosis can appear in infants or teens due to malformation of the spine or wedging of the spinal bones over time.	general
Mild kyphosis causes few problems.	general
Severe kyphosis can cause pain and be disfiguring.	general
Treatment for kyphosis depends on your age, and the cause and effects of the curvature.	general
Mild kyphosis may produce no noticeable signs or symptoms.	general
But some people experience back pain and stiffness in addition to an abnormally curved spine.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice an increased curve in your upper back or in your child's spine.	general
The individual bones (vertebrae) that make up a healthy spine look like cylinders stacked in a column.	general
Kyphosis occurs when the vertebrae in the upper back become more wedge shaped.	general
Abnormal vertebrae can be caused by: Broken or crushed vertebrae (compression fractures) can result in curvature of the spine.	general
Mild compression fractures often don't produce noticeable signs or symptoms.	general
This bone-thinning disorder can cause spinal curvature, especially if weakened vertebrae result in compression fractures.	general
Osteoporosis is most common in older women and people who have taken corticosteroids for long periods of time.	general
Osteoporosis.	general
Soft, circular disks act as cushions between spinal vertebrae.	general
With age, these disks dry out and shrink, which often worsens kyphosis.	general
Disk degeneration.	general
Also called Scheuermann's kyphosis, this disease typically begins during the growth spurt that occurs before puberty.	general
Boys are affected more often than girls.	general
Scheuermann's disease.	general
Spinal bones that don't develop properly before birth can cause kyphosis.	general
Birth defects.	general
Kyphosis in children can also be associated with certain syndromes, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome.	general
Cancer in the spine can weaken vertebrae and make them more prone to compression fractures, as can chemotherapy and radiation cancer treatments.	general
Cancer and cancer treatments.	general
Complications Severe kyphosis can put pressure on the lungs.	general
Breathing problems.	general
Kyphosis is associated with weakened back muscles and difficulty doing tasks such as walking and getting out of chairs.	general
The spinal curvature can also make it difficult to gaze upward or drive and can cause pain when you lie down.	general
Limited physical functions.	general
Severe kyphosis can compress the digestive tract, causing problems such as acid reflux and difficulty with swallowing.	general
Digestive problems.	general
People with kyphosis, especially adolescents, may develop a poor body image from having a rounded back or from wearing a brace to correct the condition.	general
For older people, poor body image can lead to social isolation.	general
Body image problems.	general
Hunter syndrome is a very rare, inherited genetic disorder caused by a missing or malfunctioning enzyme.	general
In Hunter syndrome, the body doesn't have enough of the enzyme iduronate 2-sulfatase.	general
This enzyme's job is to break down certain complex molecules, and without enough of this enzyme, the molecules build up in harmful amounts.	general
The buildup of massive amounts of these harmful substances eventually causes permanent, progressive damage affecting appearance, mental development, organ function and physical abilities.	general
Hunter syndrome is far more common in boys.	general
The condition is one type of a group of inherited metabolic disorders called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs).	general
Hunter syndrome is also known as MPS II.	general
There's no cure for Hunter syndrome.	general
Treatment involves managing symptoms and complications.	general
Hunter syndrome symptoms vary and range from mild to severe.	general
Symptoms aren't present at birth, but often begin around ages 2 to 4 as the harmful molecules build up.	general
Signs and symptoms may include: An enlarged head A protruding tongue A distended abdomen, as a result of enlarged internal organs Chronic diarrhea Joint stiffness Aggressive behavior Stunted growth When to see a doctor Hunter syndrome is very uncommon, but if you notice changes in your child's facial appearance, a loss of previously acquired skills, or other signs or symptoms listed above, talk to your child's primary care doctor.	general
He or she can help you decide if you need to see a specialist or seek further testing.	general
Hunter syndrome develops when a defective chromosome is inherited from the child's mother.	general
Because of that defective chromosome, an enzyme that's needed to break down complex sugar molecules is missing or malfunctioning.	general
Without this enzyme, massive amounts of these complex sugar molecules collect in the cells, blood and connective tissues, causing permanent and progressive damage.	general
Risk factors X-linked recessive inheritance pattern with carrier mother X-linked recessive inheritance pattern with carrier mother Women can pass down X-linked recessive disorders such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.	general
A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder has a 25 percent chance of having an unaffected son, a 25 percent chance of having an affected son, a 25 percent chance of having an unaffected daughter and a 25 percent chance of having a daughter who also is a carrier.	general
There are two major risk factors for developing Hunter syndrome: Hunter syndrome is caused by a defective chromosome, and a child must inherit the defective chromosome to develop the disease.	general
Hunter syndrome is what's known as an X-linked recessive disease, which means that women carry the defective disease-causing X chromosome and can pass it on.	general
But mothers aren't affected by the disease themselves and likely don't know that they have this defective chromosome.	general
Family history.	general
Hunter syndrome nearly always occurs in males.	general
Girls are far less at risk of developing this disease because they inherit two X chromosomes.	general
If one of the X chromosomes is defective, their normal X chromosome can provide a functioning gene.	general
If the X chromosome of a male is defective, however, there isn't another normal X chromosome to compensate for the problem.	general
Complications A variety of complications can occur with Hunter syndrome depending on the type and severity of the disease.	general
Complications can affect the lungs, heart, joints, connective tissue, and brain and nervous system.	general
Respiratory complications An enlarged tongue, thickened gums, and thickening of the nasal passages and windpipe (trachea) make breathing difficult.	general
Children often have chronic ear and sinus infections, respiratory infections, and pneumonia.	general
Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing is intermittently interrupted during sleep, is often present because of airway constriction.	general
Cardiac complications Thickening of heart tissue can cause improper closing of heart valves.	general
As a result, the heart and other parts of the body don't receive blood efficiently.	general
As the disease progresses, these conditions often become worse and typically result in heart failure.	general
The thickening of tissue can also cause narrowing of the aorta and other blood vessels.	general
This in turn can result in high blood pressure and narrowing of arteries in the lungs.	general
Skeletal and connective tissue complications The storage of undigested complex sugar molecules in connective tissues results in abnormalities in bones, joints and ligaments.	general
This reduces your child's growth, causing pain and physical malformations and making it difficult for him or her to move.	general
Joint stiffness is caused by swelling of joint connective tissues and abnormalities of cartilage and bones.	general
If your child is in pain, he or she will likely move less, which can lead to more stiffness and pain.	general
The group of abnormalities typically seen in the bones of people with Hunter syndrome is called dysostosis multiplex.	general
Children with these abnormalities can develop irregularly shaped vertebrae and spines, ribs, arms, fingers, legs, and pelvises.	general
Bone abnormalities may cause many people with Hunter syndrome to be abnormally short.	general
Those with milder cases may reach normal or near-normal height.	general
Hernias are common in Hunter syndrome.	general
A hernia occurs when soft tissue, usually part of the intestine, pokes through a weak spot or tear in the lower abdominal wall.	general
Hernias associated with Hunter syndrome can become quite large and are often one of the first signs of the disorder.	general
Enlargement of the liver and spleen may increase pressure in the abdomen, causing a hernia.	general
Brain and nervous system complications A variety of neurological complications may be present and continue to develop in children with Hunter syndrome.	general
Many neurological problems are caused by buildup of excess fluids in your child's brain.	general
Pressure from these fluids can cause other problems that may cause severe headaches, interfere with vision and change your child's mental state.	general
Your child may also develop a condition in which the membranes that surround the spinal cord may become thick and scarred.	general
This causes pressure and compression of the upper spinal cord.	general
As a result, your child may develop fatigue in his or her legs and gradually weaken and become less physically active.	general
Other disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, can result from nerve compression that happens because of bone deformities and storage of complex sugar molecules in tissues.	general
Abnormal behavior can develop in children with more-severe cases of Hunter syndrome.	general
Often your child's mental development will become affected between the ages of 2 and 6.	general
Some children are hyperactive and have trouble paying attention or following directions.	general
Your child may also behave aggressively and seem unable to sense danger.	general
As your child's overall physical functioning declines, these behavior problems tend to become less severe.	general
Seizures also may occur in children with Hunter syndrome.	general
Longer recovery from other illnesses Recovery times from normal childhood illnesses may be longer for children with Hunter syndrome.	general
As a result, be sure to take general preventive measures ‚Äî for example, get your child a flu shot and ensure your child receives all necessary vaccinations.	general
Hunter syndrome is a genetic disorder.	general
Talk to your doctor or a genetic counselor if you're thinking about having children and you or any members of your family have a genetic disorder or a family history of genetic disorders.	general
If you think you might be a carrier, genetic tests are available.	general
If you already have a child with Hunter syndrome, you may wish to seek the advice of a doctor or genetic counselor before you have more children.	general
Progeria (pro-JEER-e-uh), also known as Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, is an extremely rare, progressive genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, starting in their first two years of life.	general
Children with progeria generally appear normal at birth.	general
During the first year, signs and symptoms, such as slow growth and hair loss, begin to appear.	general
Heart problems or strokes are the eventual cause of death in most children with progeria.	general
The average life expectancy for a child with progeria is about 13 years.	general
Some with the disease may die younger and others may live longer, even up to 20 years.	general
There's no cure for progeria, but ongoing research shows some promise for treatment.	general
Usually within the first year of life, growth of a child with progeria slows markedly, but motor development and intelligence remain normal.	general
Signs and symptoms of this progressive disorder include a distinctive appearance: Slowed growth, with below-average height and weight Narrowed face, small lower jaw, thin lips and beaked nose Head disproportionately large for the face Prominent eyes and incomplete closure of the eyelids Hair loss, including eyelashes and eyebrows Thinning, spotty, wrinkled skin Severe progressive heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease Hardening and tightening of skin on the trunk and extremities (similar to scleroderma) Delayed and abnormal tooth formation Some hearing loss Loss of fat under the skin and loss of muscle mass Skeletal abnormalities and fragile bones Stiff joints Hip dislocation Insulin resistance When to see a doctor Progeria is usually detected in infancy or early childhood, often at regular checkups, when a baby first shows the characteristic signs of premature aging.	general
If you notice changes in your child that could be signs and symptoms of progeria, or you have any concerns about your child's growth or development, make an appointment with your child's doctor.	general
A single gene mutation is responsible for progeria.	general
The gene, known as lamin A (LMNA), makes a protein necessary for holding the center (nucleus) of a cell together.	general
When this gene has a defect (mutation), an abnormal form of the lamin A protein called progerin is produced and makes cells unstable.	general
This appears to lead to progeria's aging process.	general
Unlike many genetic mutations, progeria is rarely passed down in families.	general
The gene mutation is a rare, chance occurrence in the majority of cases.	general
Other similar syndromes There are other progeroid syndromes that do run in families.	general
These inherited syndromes cause rapid aging and a shortened life span: also known as neonatal progeroid syndrome, starts in the womb, with signs and symptoms of aging apparent at birth.	general
Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome, also known as adult progeria, begins in the teen years or early adulthood, causing premature aging and conditions typical of old age, such as cataracts and diabetes.	general
Werner syndrome, Risk factors There are no known factors, such as lifestyle or environmental issues, which increase the risk of having progeria or of giving birth to a child with progeria.	general
Progeria is extremely rare.	general
For parents who have had one child with progeria, the chances of having a second child with progeria are about 2 to 3 percent.	general
Complications Children with progeria usually develop severe hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).	general
This is a condition in which the walls of the arteries ‚Äî blood vessels that carry nutrients and oxygen from the heart to the rest of the body ‚Äî stiffen and thicken, often restricting blood flow.	general
Most children with progeria die of complications related to atherosclerosis, including: Problems with blood vessels that supply the heart (cardiovascular problems), resulting in heart attack and congestive heart failure Problems with blood vessels that supply the brain (cerebrovascular problems), resulting in stroke Other health problems frequently associated with aging ‚Äî such as arthritis, cataracts and increased cancer risk ‚Äî typically do not develop as part of the course of progeria.	general
A hydrocele (HI-droe-seel) is a type of swelling in the scrotum that occurs when fluid collects in the thin sheath surrounding a testicle.	general
Hydrocele is common in newborns and usually disappears without treatment by age 1.	general
Older boys and adult men can develop a hydrocele due to inflammation or injury within the scrotum.	general
A hydrocele usually isn't painful or harmful and might not need any treatment.	general
But if you have scrotal swelling, see your doctor to rule out other causes.	general
Usually, the only indication of a hydrocele is a painless swelling of one or both testicles.	general
Adult men with a hydrocele might experience discomfort from the heaviness of a swollen scrotum.	general
Pain generally increases with the size of the inflammation.	general
Sometimes, the swollen area might be smaller in the morning and larger later in the day.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you or your child experiences scrotal swelling.	general
It's important to rule out other causes of the swelling that might require treatment.	general
For example, a hydrocele might be associated with a weak point in the abdominal wall that allows a loop of intestine to extend into the scrotum (inguinal hernia).	general
A baby's hydrocele typically disappears on its own.	general
But if your baby's hydrocele doesn't disappear after a year or if it enlarges, ask your child's doctor to examine the hydrocele again.	general
Get immediate medical treatment if you or your child develops sudden, severe scrotal pain or swelling, especially within several hours of an injury to the scrotum.	general
These signs and symptoms can occur with a number of conditions, including blocked blood flow in a twisted testicle (testicular torsion).	general
Testicular torsion must be treated within hours of the beginning of signs and symptoms to save the testicle.	general
Hydrocele is the type of scrotal swelling that occurs when fluid collects in the thin sheath that surrounds the testicle.	general
A hydrocele can develop before birth.	general
Normally, the testicles descend from the developing baby's abdominal cavity into the scrotum.	general
A sac accompanies each testicle, allowing fluid to surround the testicles.	general
Usually, each sac closes and the fluid is absorbed.	general
Sometimes, the fluid remains after the sac closes (noncommunicating hydrocele).	general
The fluid is usually absorbed gradually within the first year of life.	general
But occasionally, the sac remains open (communicating hydrocele).	general
The sac can change size or if the scrotal sac is compressed, fluid can flow back into the abdomen.	general
Communicating hydroceles are often associated with inguinal hernia.	general
Older males A hydrocele can develop as a result of injury or inflammation within the scrotum.	general
Inflammation might be caused by an infection in the testicle or in the small, coiled tube at the back of each testicle (epididymitis).	general
Risk factors Most hydroceles are present at birth.	general
At least 5 percent of newborn boys have a hydrocele.	general
Babies who are born prematurely have a higher risk of having a hydrocele.	general
Risk factors for developing a hydrocele later in life include: Injury or inflammation to the scrotum Infection, including a sexually transmitted infection (STI) Complications A hydrocele typically isn't dangerous and usually doesn't affect fertility.	general
But a hydrocele might be associated with an underlying testicular condition that can cause serious complications, including: Either might reduce sperm production or function.	general
Infection or tumor.	general
The loop of intestine trapped in the abdominal wall can lead to life-threatening complications.	general
Inguinal hernia.	general
Hydrocephalus is the buildup of fluid in the cavities (ventricles) deep within the brain.	general
The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain.	general
Cerebrospinal fluid normally flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column.	general
But the pressure of too much cerebrospinal fluid associated with hydrocephalus can damage brain tissues and cause a range of impairments in brain function.	general
Hydrocephalus can happen at any age, but it occurs more frequently among infants and adults 60 and over.	general
Surgical treatment for hydrocephalus can restore and maintain normal cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain.	general
Many different therapies are often required to manage symptoms or functional impairments resulting from hydrocephalus.	general
The signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus vary somewhat by age of onset.	general
Changes in the head An unusually large head A rapid increase in the size of the head A bulging or tense soft spot (fontanel) on the top of the head Physical signs and symptoms Deficits in muscle tone and strength Poor responsiveness to touch Among toddlers and older children, signs and symptoms may include: Physical signs and symptoms Sleepiness or lethargy Nausea or vomiting Decline in school performance Delays or problems with previously acquired skills, such as walking or talking Young and middle-aged adults Loss of bladder control or a frequent urge to urinate Impaired vision Decline in memory, concentration and other thinking skills that may affect job performance Older adults Among adults 60 years of age and older, the more common signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus are: Loss of bladder control or a frequent urge to urinate Memory loss Progressive loss of other thinking or reasoning skills Difficulty walking, often described as a shuffling gait or the feeling of the feet being stuck Poor coordination or balance When to see a doctor experiencing these signs and symptoms: Seek emergency medical care for infants and toddlers A high-pitched cry Unexplained, recurrent vomiting Breathing difficulties for other signs or symptoms in any age group.	general
Seek prompt medical attention Because more than one condition can result in the problems associated with hydrocephalus, it's important to get a timely diagnosis and appropriate care.	general
Brain ventricles Brain ventricles Your brain floats in a bath of cerebrospinal fluid.	general
This fluid also fills large open structures, called ventricles, which lie deep inside your brain.	general
The fluid-filled ventricles help keep the brain buoyant and cushioned.	general
Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between how much cerebrospinal fluid is produced and how much is absorbed into the bloodstream.	general
Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by tissues lining the ventricles of the brain.	general
It flows through the ventricles by way of interconnecting channels.	general
The fluid eventually flows into spaces around the brain and spinal column.	general
It's absorbed primarily by blood vessels in tissues near the base of the brain.	general
Cerebrospinal fluid plays an important role in brain function by: Keeping the brain buoyant, allowing the relatively heavy brain to float within the skull Cushioning the brain to prevent injury Removing waste products of the brain's metabolism Flowing back and forth between the brain cavity and spinal column to maintain a constant pressure within the brain ‚Äî compensating for changes in blood pressure in the brain Excess cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles occurs for one of the following reasons: The most common problem is a partial obstruction of the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, either from one ventricle to another or from the ventricles to other spaces around the brain.	general
Obstruction.	general
Less common is a problem with the mechanisms that enable the blood vessels to absorb cerebrospinal fluid.	general
This is often related to inflammation of brain tissues from disease or injury.	general
Poor absorption.	general
Rarely, cerebrospinal fluid is created more quickly than it can be absorbed.	general
Overproduction.	general
Risk factors In many cases, the exact event leading to hydrocephalus is unknown.	general
However, a number of developmental or medical problems can contribute to or trigger hydrocephalus.	general
Hydrocephalus present at birth (congenital) or shortly after birth may occur because of any of the following: Abnormal development of the central nervous system that can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid Bleeding within the ventricles, a possible complication of premature birth Infection in the uterus during a pregnancy, such as rubella or syphilis, that can cause inflammation in fetal brain tissues Other contributing factors Other factors that can contribute to hydrocephalus among any age group include: Lesions or tumors of the brain or spinal cord Central nervous system infections, such as bacterial meningitis or mumps Bleeding in the brain from a stroke or head injury Other traumatic injury to the brain Complications Long-term complications of hydrocephalus can vary widely and are often difficult to predict.	general
If hydrocephalus has progressed by the time of birth, it may result in significant intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities.	general
Less severe cases, when treated appropriately, may have few, if any, serious complications.	general
Adults who have experienced a significant decline in memory or other thinking skills generally have poorer recoveries and persistent symptoms after treatment of hydrocephalus.	general
Hydronephrosis Hydronephrosis Hydronephrosis Hydronephrosis occurs when a kidney has an excess of fluid due to a backup of urine, often caused by an obstruction in the upper part of the urinary tract.	general
Kidney swelling can result, causing the part of the kidney called the renal pelvis to bulge (distend), leading to possible kidney scarring and impaired kidney function.	general
Hydronephrosis is swelling of one or both kidneys.	general
Kidney swelling happens when urine can't drain from a kidney and builds up in the kidney as a result.	general
This can occur from a blockage in the tubes that drain urine from the kidneys (ureters) or from an anatomical defect that doesn't allow urine to drain properly.	general
Hydronephrosis can happen at any age.	general
Hydronephrosis in children may be diagnosed during infancy or sometimes during a prenatal ultrasound before the baby is born.	general
Hydronephrosis doesn't always cause symptoms.	general
When they occur, signs and symptoms of hydronephrosis might include: Pain in the side and back (flank pain) that may travel to the lower abdomen or groin Urinary problems, such as pain with urination or feeling an urgent or frequent need to urinate Nausea and vomiting Normally, urine goes from the kidney to the tube that drains the kidney (ureter), to the bladder and then out of the body.	general
But, sometimes urine backs up or remains inside the kidney or in the ureter.	general
That's when hydronephrosis can develop.	general
Some common causes of hydronephrosis include: Urinary tract blockages often form where the kidney meets the ureter, at a point called the ureteropelvic junction.	general
Less commonly, blockages may occur where the ureter meets the bladder at what's called the ureterovesical junction.	general
Partial blockage in the urinary tract.	general
Vesicoureteral reflux happens when urine flows backward through the ureter from the bladder up into the kidney.	general
Normally, urine flows only one way in the ureter.	general
Urine flowing the wrong way makes it difficult for the kidney to empty properly and causes the kidney to swell.	general
Vesicoureteral reflux.	general
Less-common causes of hydronephrosis include kidney stones, a tumor in the abdomen or pelvis, and problems with nerves that lead to the bladder.	general
to evaluate kidney function A blood test to check for signs of infection or urinary stones that could cause a blockage A urine test during which your doctor can view the kidneys, bladder and other urinary structures to identify potential problems An ultrasound imaging exam, an X-ray exam that uses a special dye to outline the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra, capturing images before and during urination A voiding cystourethrogram, Depending on the results from initial testing, your doctor may recommend additional imaging exams, such as a computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	general
Another possibility is a test called a MAG3 scan, a nuclear medicine imaging test that evaluates the function and drainage in the kidney.	general
You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in conditions affecting the urinary system (urologist).	general
Treatment for hydronephrosis depends on the underlying cause.	general
Although surgery is sometimes needed, in many cases hydronephrosis resolves on its own.	general
Your doctor may opt for a wait-and-see approach to treatment, as hydronephrosis could resolve on its own.	general
Even so, your doctor may recommend preventive antibiotic therapy to lower the risk of urinary tract infections.	general
Mild to moderate hydronephrosis.	general
When hydronephrosis makes it hard for the kidney to function ‚Äî as can happen in more-severe cases or in cases that involve reflux ‚Äî surgery may be recommended to eliminate the blockage or correct the reflux.	general
Severe hydronephrosis.	general
Left untreated, severe hydronephrosis could lead to permanent kidney damage.	general
Rarely, it can cause kidney failure.	general
In most cases, however, this condition does resolve successfully.	general
In the meantime, because hydronephrosis typically affects only one kidney, the other kidney can do the work for both.	general
Parathyroid glands Parathyroid glands The parathyroid glands, which lie behind the thyroid, manufacture the parathyroid hormone, which plays a role in regulating your body's levels of the minerals calcium and phosphorus.	general
Hypercalcemia is a condition in which the calcium level in your blood is above normal.	general
Too much calcium in your blood can weaken your bones, create kidney stones, and interfere with how your heart and brain work.	general
Hypercalcemia is usually a result of overactive parathyroid glands.	general
These four tiny glands are situated behind the thyroid gland.	general
Other causes of hypercalcemia include cancer, certain other medical disorders, some medications, and taking too much of calcium and vitamin D supplements.	general
Signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia range from nonexistent to severe.	general
Treatment depends on the cause.	general
Parathyroid You might not have signs or symptoms if your hypercalcemia is mild.	general
More-severe cases produce signs and symptoms related to the parts of your body affected by the high calcium levels in your blood.	general
Examples include: Excess calcium in your blood means your kidneys have to work harder to filter it.	general
This can cause excessive thirst and frequent urination.	general
Hypercalcemia can cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting and constipation.	general
Digestive system.	general
In most cases, the excess calcium in your blood was leached from your bones, which weakens them.	general
This can cause bone pain, muscle weakness and depression.	general
Bones and muscles.	general
Hypercalcemia can interfere with the way your brain works, resulting in confusion, lethargy and fatigue.	general
It can also cause depression.	general
Rarely, severe hypercalcemia can interfere with your heart function, causing palpitations and fainting, indications of cardiac arrhythmia, and other heart problems.	general
When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if you develop signs and symptoms that might indicate hypercalcemia, such as being extremely thirsty, urinating frequently and having abdominal pain.	general
Besides building strong bones and teeth, calcium helps muscles contract and nerves transmit signals.	general
Normally, if there isn't enough calcium in your blood, your parathyroid glands secrete a hormone that triggers: Your bones to release calcium into your blood Your digestive tract to absorb more calcium Your kidneys to excrete less calcium and activate more vitamin D, which plays a vital role in calcium absorption This delicate balance between too little calcium in your blood and hypercalcemia can be disrupted by a variety of factors.	general
Hypercalcemia is caused by: The most common cause of hypercalcemia, overactive parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism) can stem from a small, noncancerous (benign) tumor or enlargement of one or more of the four parathyroid glands.	general
Overactive parathyroid glands.	general
Lung cancer and breast cancer, as well as some cancers of the blood, can increase your risk of hypercalcemia.	general
Spread of cancer (metastasis) to your bones also increases your risk.	general
Certain diseases, such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, can raise blood levels of vitamin D, which stimulates your digestive tract to absorb more calcium.	general
Other diseases.	general
A rare genetic disorder known as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia causes an increase of calcium in your blood because of faulty calcium receptors in your body.	general
This condition doesn't cause symptoms or complications of hypercalcemia.	general
Hereditary factors.	general
People who have a condition that causes them to spend a lot of time sitting or lying down can develop hypercalcemia.	general
Over time, bones that don't bear weight release calcium into the blood.	general
Immobility.	general
A common cause of mild or transient hypercalcemia is dehydration.	general
Having less fluid in your blood causes a rise in calcium concentrations.	general
Severe dehydration.	general
Certain drugs ‚Äî such as lithium, which is used to treat bipolar disorder ‚Äî might increase the release of parathyroid hormone.	general
Medications.	general
Taking excessive amounts of calcium or vitamin D supplements over time can raise calcium levels in your blood above normal.	general
Supplements.	general
Risk factors Women older than 50 are at highest risk of overactive parathyroid glands.	general
Complications Hypercalcemia complications can include: If your bones continue to release calcium into your blood, you can develop the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, which could lead to bone fractures, spinal column curvature and loss of height.	general
Osteoporosis.	general
If your urine contains too much calcium, crystals may form in your kidneys.	general
Over time, the crystals may combine to form kidney stones.	general
Passing a stone can be extremely painful.	general
Kidney stones.	general
Severe hypercalcemia can damage your kidneys, limiting their ability to cleanse the blood and eliminate fluid.	general
Kidney failure.	general
Severe hypercalcemia can lead to confusion, dementia and coma, which can be fatal.	general
Nervous system problems.	general
Hypercalcemia can affect the electrical impulses that regulate your heartbeat, causing your heart to beat irregularly.	general
Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia).	general
Hypereosinophilic (hy-per-ee-o-SIN-o-phil-ik) syndrome (HES) is a group of blood disorders that occur when you have high numbers of eosinophils ‚Äî white blood cells that play an important role in your immune system.	general
Over time, the excess eosinophils enter various tissues, eventually damaging your organs.	general
The most common targets are the skin, lungs, digestive tract, heart, blood and nervous system.	general
Untreated, HES can become life-threatening.	general
HES can affect anyone.	general
But it occurs more often in men, usually between the ages of 20 and 50.	general
Symptoms vary, depending on what part of your body is affected.	general
Skin signs and symptoms include itching and rashes.	general
If your lungs are affected, you may be short of breath and have a cough.	general
High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) affects people who have diabetes.	general
Several factors can contribute to hyperglycemia in people with diabetes, including food and physical activity choices, illness, nondiabetes medications, or skipping or not taking enough glucose-lowering medication.	general
It's important to treat hyperglycemia, because if left untreated, hyperglycemia can become severe and lead to serious complications requiring emergency care, such as a diabetic coma.	general
In the long term, persistent hyperglycemia, even if not severe, can lead to complications affecting your eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart.	general
Products & Services Hyperglycemia doesn't cause symptoms until glucose values are significantly elevated ‚Äî usually above 180 to 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 10 to 11 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).	general
Symptoms of hyperglycemia develop slowly over several days or weeks.	general
The longer blood sugar levels stay high, the more serious the symptoms become.	general
However, some people who've had type 2 diabetes for a long time may not show any symptoms despite elevated blood sugar levels.	general
Early signs and symptoms Recognizing early signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia can help you treat the condition promptly.	general
Watch for: Frequent urination Increased thirst Blurred vision Later signs and symptoms If hyperglycemia goes untreated, it can cause toxic acids (ketones) to build up in your blood and urine (ketoacidosis).	general
Signs and symptoms include: Fruity-smelling breath Call 911 or emergency medical assistance if: You're sick and can't keep any food or fluids down, and Your blood glucose levels are persistently above 240 mg/dL (13 mmol/L) and you have ketones in your urine Make an appointment with your doctor if: You experience ongoing diarrhea or vomiting, but you're able to take some foods or drinks You have a fever that lasts more than 24 hours Your blood glucose is more than 240 mg/dL (13 mmol/L) even though you've taken your diabetes medication You have trouble keeping your blood glucose within the desired range During digestion, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods ‚Äî such as bread, rice and pasta ‚Äî into various sugar molecules.	general
One of these sugar molecules is glucose, a main energy source for your body.	general
Glucose is absorbed directly into your bloodstream after you eat, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin ‚Äî a hormone secreted by your pancreas.	general
When the level of glucose in your blood rises, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.	general
The insulin, in turn, unlocks your cells so that glucose can enter and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly.	general
Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen.	general
This process lowers the amount of glucose in your bloodstream and prevents it from reaching dangerously high levels.	general
As your blood sugar level returns to normal, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.	general
Diabetes drastically diminishes the effects of insulin on your body, either because your pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or because your body is resistant to the effects of insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level (type 2 diabetes).	general
As a result, glucose tends to build up in your bloodstream (hyperglycemia) and may reach dangerously high levels if not treated properly.	general
Insulin or other drugs are used to lower blood sugar levels.	general
Risk factors Not using enough insulin or oral diabetes medication Not injecting insulin properly or using expired insulin Not following your diabetes eating plan Being inactive Using certain medications, such as steroids Being injured or having surgery Experiencing emotional stress, such as family conflict or workplace challenges Illness or stress can trigger hyperglycemia because hormones produced to combat illness or stress can also cause your blood sugar to rise.	general
Even people who don't have diabetes may develop hyperglycemia during severe illness.	general
But people with diabetes may need to take extra diabetes medication to keep blood glucose near normal during illness or stress.	general
Complications Long-term complications Keeping tight control of your blood sugar can help prevent many diabetes-related complications.	general
Long-term complications of untreated hyperglycemia can include: Cardiovascular disease Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) or kidney failure Damage to the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness Clouding of the normally clear lens of your eye (cataract) Feet problems caused by damaged nerves or poor blood flow that can lead to serious skin infections, ulcerations, and in some severe cases, amputation Bone and joint problems Teeth and gum infections Emergency complications If blood sugar rises high enough or for a prolonged period of time, it can lead to two serious conditions.	general
Diabetic ketoacidosis develops when you don't have enough insulin in your body.	general
When this happens, sugar (glucose) can't enter your cells for energy.	general
Your blood sugar level rises, and your body begins to break down fat for energy.	general
Diabetic ketoacidosis.	general
This process produces toxic acids known as ketones.	general
"Excess ketones accumulate in the blood and eventually ""spill over"" into the urine."	general
Left untreated, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to a diabetic coma and be life-threatening.	general
This condition occurs when people produce insulin, but it doesn't work properly.	general
Blood glucose levels may become very high ‚Äî greater than 600 mg/dL (33 mmol/L).	general
Because insulin is present but not working properly, the body can't use either glucose or fat for energy.	general
Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.	general
Glucose is then spilled into the urine, causing increased urination.	general
Left untreated, diabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state can lead to life-threatening dehydration and coma.	general
Prompt medical care is essential.	general
The following suggestions can help keep your blood sugar within your target range: If you take insulin or oral diabetes medication, it's important that you be consistent about the amount and timing of your meals and snacks.	general
The food you eat must be in balance with the insulin working in your body.	general
Follow your diabetes meal plan.	general
Depending on your treatment plan, you may check and record your blood sugar level several times a week or several times a day.	general
Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range.	general
Note when your glucose readings are above or below your goal range.	general
Monitor your blood sugar.	general
Take your medication as prescribed by your health care provider.	general
The adjustment depends on the blood sugar test results and on the type and length of the activity.	general
Adjust your medication if you change your physical activity.	general
Hyperoxaluria occurs when you have too much oxalate in your urine.	general
Oxalate is a natural chemical in your body, and it's also found in certain types of food.	general
But too much oxalate in your urine can cause serious problems.	general
Hyperoxaluria can be caused by inherited (genetic) disorders, an intestinal disease or eating too many oxalate-rich foods.	general
The long-term health of your kidneys depends on early diagnosis and prompt treatment of hyperoxaluria.	general
Oxalosis happens after the kidneys fail in people who have primary and intestinal causes of hyperoxaluria, and excess oxalate builds up in the blood.	general
This can lead to oxalate deposits in blood vessels, bones and body organs.	general
Often, the first sign of hyperoxaluria is a kidney stone.	general
Symptoms of a kidney stone can include: Severe or sudden back pain Pain in the area below the ribs on the back (flank) that doesn't go away Blood in the urine Frequent urge to urinate When to see a doctor Kidney stones in childhood are uncommon.	general
Kidney stones that form in children and teenagers are likely to be caused by an underlying condition, such as hyperoxaluria.	general
All young people with kidney stones should see a doctor for a thorough evaluation, including a test that measures oxalate in the urine.	general
Adults with recurrent kidney stones also should be evaluated for oxalate in the urine.	general
Hyperoxaluria occurs when there is too much of a substance called oxalate in the urine.	general
There are several types of hyperoxaluria: Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare inherited (genetic) condition present at birth.	general
In this type, the liver doesn't create enough of a certain protein (enzyme) that prevents overproduction of oxalate, or the enzyme doesn't work properly.	general
Excess oxalate is eliminated through your kidneys, in your urine.	general
The extra oxalate can combine with calcium to create kidney stones and crystals, which can damage the kidneys and cause them to stop working (renal failure).	general
Primary hyperoxaluria.	general
Kidney stones form early and most often cause symptoms during childhood or adolescence.	general
Because of the very large amounts of oxalate produced, the kidneys of many people with primary hyperoxaluria fail by early to middle adulthood.	general
But renal failure can occur as early as infancy, while others with primary hyperoxaluria never develop kidney failure.	general
To date, experts have identified three different genetic causes of primary hyperoxaluria.	general
Oxalosis occurs if you have primary hyperoxaluria and your kidneys fail.	general
Because your body can no longer eliminate the extra oxalate, it starts accumulating ‚Äî first in your blood, then in your eyes, bones, skin, muscles, blood vessels, heart and other organs.	general
This can cause multiple problems.	general
Several intestinal diseases, including Crohn's disease and short bowel syndrome as a result of surgical procedures, increase the absorption of oxalate from foods, which can then increase the amount of oxalate excreted in the urine.	general
Enteric hyperoxaluria.	general
Eating large amounts of foods high in oxalate can increase your risk of hyperoxaluria or kidney stones.	general
Ask your doctor or dietitian for a list of high-oxalate foods.	general
Avoiding high-oxalate foods is particularly important if you have enteric hyperoxaluria.	general
Hyperoxaluria related to eating high-oxalate foods.	general
Complications Untreated primary hyperoxaluria can eventually damage your kidneys.	general
Over time your kidneys may stop working.	general
For some people, this is the first sign of the disease.	general
Signs and symptoms of kidney failure include: Decreased urine output or no urine output at all Feeling generally ill and tired Loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting Pale skin color related to anemia Swelling of hands and feet Oxalosis in its late stages can cause a variety of complications outside the kidney, including bone disease, anemia, skin ulcers, heart and eye problems, and in children, a failure to develop and grow normally.	general
Parathyroid glands Parathyroid glands The parathyroid glands, which lie behind the thyroid, manufacture the parathyroid hormone, which plays a role in regulating your body's levels of the minerals calcium and phosphorus.	general
Hyperparathyroidism is an excess of parathyroid hormone in the bloodstream due to overactivity of one or more of the body's four parathyroid glands.	general
These glands are about the size of a grain of rice and are located in your neck.	general
The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone, which helps maintain an appropriate balance of calcium in the bloodstream and in tissues that depend on calcium for proper functioning.	general
Two types of hyperparathyroidism exist.	general
In primary hyperparathyroidism, an enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands causes overproduction of the hormone, resulting in high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), which can cause a variety of health problems.	general
Surgery is the most common treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism.	general
Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs as a result of another disease that initially causes low levels of calcium in the body and over time, increased parathyroid hormone levels occur.	general
Hyperparathyroidism is often diagnosed before signs or symptoms of the disorder are apparent.	general
When symptoms do occur, they're the result of damage or dysfunction in other organs or tissues due to high calcium levels circulating in the blood and urine or too little calcium in bones.	general
Symptoms may be so mild and nonspecific that they don't seem at all related to parathyroid function, or they may be severe.	general
The range of signs and symptoms include: Fragile bones that easily fracture (osteoporosis) Kidney stones Excessive urination Abdominal pain Nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.	general
These symptoms could be caused by any number of disorders, including some with serious complications.	general
It's important to get a prompt, accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.	general
Hyperparathyroidism is caused by factors that increase the production of parathyroid hormone.	general
The parathyroid glands maintain proper levels of both calcium and phosphorus in your body by turning the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) off or on, much like a thermostat controls a heating system to maintain a constant air temperature.	general
Vitamin D also is involved in regulating the amount of calcium in your blood.	general
Normally, this balancing act works well.	general
When calcium levels in your blood fall too low, your parathyroid glands secrete enough PTH to restore the balance.	general
PTH raises calcium levels by releasing calcium from your bones and increasing the amount of calcium absorbed from your small intestine.	general
When blood-calcium levels are too high, the parathyroid glands produce less PTH.	general
But sometimes one or more of these glands produce too much hormone, leading to abnormally high levels of calcium (hypercalcemia) and low levels of phosphorus in your blood.	general
The mineral calcium is best known for its role in keeping your teeth and bones healthy.	general
But calcium has other functions.	general
It aids in the transmission of signals in nerve cells, and it's involved in muscle contraction.	general
Phosphorus, another mineral, works in conjunction with calcium in these areas.	general
The disorder can generally be divided into two types based on the cause.	general
Hyperparathyroidism may occur because of a problem with the parathyroid glands themselves (primary hyperparathyroidism) or because of another disease that affects the glands' function (secondary hyperparathyroidism).	general
Primary hyperparathyroidism Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs because of some problem with one or more of the four parathyroid glands: A noncancerous growth (adenoma) on a gland is the most common cause.	general
Enlargement (hyperplasia) of two or more parathyroid glands accounts for most other cases.	general
A cancerous (malignant) tumor is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism.	general
Primary hyperparathyroidism usually occurs randomly, but some people inherit a gene that causes the disorder.	general
Secondary hyperparathyroidism Secondary hyperparathyroidism is the result of another condition that lowers calcium levels.	general
Therefore, your parathyroid glands overwork to compensate for the loss of calcium.	general
Factors that may contribute to secondary hyperparathyroidism include: Your body may not get enough calcium from your diet, often because your digestive system doesn't absorb the calcium from it.	general
Severe calcium deficiency.	general
Vitamin D helps maintain appropriate levels of calcium in the blood, and it helps your digestive system absorb calcium from your food.	general
Severe vitamin D deficiency.	general
Your body produces vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight, and you consume some vitamin D in food.	general
If you don't get enough vitamin D, then calcium levels may drop.	general
Your kidneys convert vitamin D into a form that your body can use.	general
If your kidneys function poorly, usable vitamin D may decline and calcium levels drop.	general
Chronic kidney failure is the most common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism.	general
Chronic kidney failure.	general
Risk factors You may be at an increased risk of primary hyperparathyroidism if you: Are a woman who has gone through menopause Have had prolonged, severe calcium or vitamin D deficiency Have a rare, inherited disorder, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1, which usually affects multiple glands Have had radiation treatment for cancer that has exposed your neck to radiation Have taken lithium, a drug most often used to treat bipolar disorder Complications Complications of hyperparathyroidism are primarily related to the long-term effect of too little calcium in your bones and too much calcium circulating in your bloodstream.	general
Common complications include: The loss of calcium often results in weak, brittle bones that fracture easily (osteoporosis).	general
Osteoporosis.	general
The excess of calcium in your blood may lead to excess calcium in your urine, which can cause small, hard deposits of calcium and other substances to form in your kidneys.	general
A kidney stone usually causes significant pain as it passes through the urinary tract.	general
Kidney stones.	general
Although the exact cause-and-effect link is unclear, high calcium levels are associated with cardiovascular conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension) and certain types of heart disease.	general
Cardiovascular disease.	general
Severe, untreated hyperparathyroidism in pregnant women may cause dangerously low levels of calcium in newborns.	general
Neonatal hypoparathyroidism.	general
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys.	general
Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal.	general
Left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to serious ‚Äî even fatal ‚Äî complications for both you and your baby.	general
If you have preeclampsia, the most effective treatment is delivery of your baby.	general
Even after delivering the baby, it can still take a while for you to get better.	general
If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia too early in your pregnancy to deliver your baby, you and your doctor face a challenging task.	general
Your baby needs more time to mature, but you need to avoid putting yourself or your baby at risk of serious complications.	general
Rarely, preeclampsia develops after delivery of a baby, a condition known as postpartum preeclampsia.	general
Products & Services Preeclampsia sometimes develops without any symptoms.	general
High blood pressure may develop slowly, or it may have a sudden onset.	general
Monitoring your blood pressure is an important part of prenatal care because the first sign of preeclampsia is commonly a rise in blood pressure.	general
Blood pressure that exceeds 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or greater ‚Äî documented on two occasions, at least four hours apart ‚Äî is abnormal.	general
Other signs and symptoms of preeclampsia may include: Excess protein in your urine (proteinuria) or additional signs of kidney problems Severe headaches Changes in vision, including temporary loss of vision, blurred vision or light sensitivity Upper abdominal pain, usually under your ribs on the right side Nausea or vomiting Decreased urine output Impaired liver function Shortness of breath, caused by fluid in your lungs Sudden weight gain and swelling (edema) ‚Äî particularly in your face and hands ‚Äî may occur with preeclampsia.	general
But these also occur in many normal pregnancies, so they're not considered reliable signs of preeclampsia.	general
When to see a doctor Make sure you attend your prenatal visits so that your care provider can monitor your blood pressure.	general
Contact your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room if you have severe headaches, blurred vision or other visual disturbance, severe pain in your abdomen, or severe shortness of breath.	general
Because headaches, nausea, and aches and pains are common pregnancy complaints, it's difficult to know when new symptoms are simply part of being pregnant and when they may indicate a serious problem ‚Äî especially if it's your first pregnancy.	general
If you're concerned about your symptoms, contact your doctor.	general
The exact cause of preeclampsia involves several factors.	general
Experts believe it begins in the placenta ‚Äî the organ that nourishes the fetus throughout pregnancy.	general
Early in pregnancy, new blood vessels develop and evolve to efficiently send blood to the placenta.	general
In women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don't seem to develop or function properly.	general
They're narrower than normal blood vessels and react differently to hormonal signaling, which limits the amount of blood that can flow through them.	general
Causes of this abnormal development may include: Insufficient blood flow to the uterus Damage to the blood vessels A problem with the immune system Certain genes Other high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy Preeclampsia is classified as one of four high blood pressure disorders that can occur during pregnancy.	general
The other three are: Women with gestational hypertension have high blood pressure but no excess protein in their urine or other signs of organ damage.	general
Some women with gestational hypertension eventually develop preeclampsia.	general
Gestational hypertension.	general
Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy or that occurs before 20 weeks of pregnancy.	general
But because high blood pressure usually doesn't have symptoms, it may be hard to determine when it began.	general
Chronic hypertension.	general
This condition occurs in women who have been diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure before pregnancy, but then develop worsening high blood pressure and protein in the urine or other health complications during pregnancy.	general
Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia.	general
Risk factors Preeclampsia develops only as a complication of pregnancy.	general
Risk factors include: A personal or family history of preeclampsia significantly raises your risk of preeclampsia.	general
History of preeclampsia.	general
If you already have chronic hypertension, you have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia.	general
Chronic hypertension.	general
The risk of developing preeclampsia is highest during your first pregnancy.	general
First pregnancy.	general
Each pregnancy with a new partner increases the risk of preeclampsia more than does a second or third pregnancy with the same partner.	general
New paternity.	general
The risk of preeclampsia is higher for very young pregnant women as well as pregnant women older than 40.	general
Black women have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia than women of other races.	general
The risk of preeclampsia is higher if you're obese.	general
Preeclampsia is more common in women who are carrying twins, triplets or other multiples.	general
Multiple pregnancy.	general
Having babies less than two years or more than 10 years apart leads to a higher risk of preeclampsia.	general
Interval between pregnancies.	general
Having certain conditions before you become pregnant ‚Äî such as chronic high blood pressure, migraines, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, a tendency to develop blood clots, or lupus ‚Äî increases your risk of preeclampsia.	general
History of certain conditions.	general
Your risk of preeclampsia is increased if your baby was conceived with in vitro fertilization.	general
In vitro fertilization.	general
Complications The more severe your preeclampsia and the earlier it occurs in your pregnancy, the greater the risks for you and your baby.	general
Preeclampsia may require induced labor and delivery.	general
Delivery by cesarean delivery (C-section) may be necessary if there are clinical or obstetric conditions that require a speedy delivery.	general
Otherwise, your doctor may recommend a scheduled vaginal delivery.	general
Your obstetric provider will talk with you about what type of delivery is right for your condition.	general
Complications of preeclampsia may include: Preeclampsia affects the arteries carrying blood to the placenta.	general
If the placenta doesn't get enough blood, your baby may receive inadequate blood and oxygen and fewer nutrients.	general
This can lead to slow growth known as fetal growth restriction, low birth weight or preterm birth.	general
Fetal growth restriction.	general
If you have preeclampsia with severe features, you may need to be delivered early, to save the life of you and your baby.	general
Prematurity can lead to breathing and other problems for your baby.	general
Your health care provider will help you understand when is the ideal time for your delivery.	general
Preterm birth.	general
Preeclampsia increases your risk of placental abruption, a condition in which the placenta separates from the inner wall of your uterus before delivery.	general
Severe abruption can cause heavy bleeding, which can be life-threatening for both you and your baby.	general
Placental abruption.	general
HELLP ‚Äî which stands for hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count ‚Äî syndrome is a more severe form of preeclampsia, and can rapidly become life-threatening for both you and your baby.	general
HELLP syndrome.	general
Symptoms of HELLP syndrome include nausea and vomiting, headache, and upper right abdominal pain.	general
HELLP syndrome is particularly dangerous because it represents damage to several organ systems.	general
On occasion, it may develop suddenly, even before high blood pressure is detected or it may develop without any symptoms at all.	general
When preeclampsia isn't controlled, eclampsia ‚Äî which is essentially preeclampsia plus seizures ‚Äî can develop.	general
It is very difficult to predict which patients will have preeclampsia that is severe enough to result in eclampsia.	general
Often, there are no symptoms or warning signs to predict eclampsia.	general
Because eclampsia can have serious consequences for both mom and baby, delivery becomes necessary, regardless of how far along the pregnancy is.	general
Preeclampsia may result in damage to the kidneys, liver, lung, heart, or eyes, and may cause a stroke or other brain injury.	general
The amount of injury to other organs depends on the severity of preeclampsia.	general
Other organ damage.	general
Having preeclampsia may increase your risk of future heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease.	general
The risk is even greater if you've had preeclampsia more than once or you've had a preterm delivery.	general
To minimize this risk, after delivery try to maintain your ideal weight, eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, and don't smoke.	general
Cardiovascular disease.	general
Researchers continue to study ways to prevent preeclampsia, but so far, no clear strategies have emerged.	general
Eating less salt, changing your activities, restricting calories, or consuming garlic or fish oil doesn't reduce your risk.	general
Increasing your intake of vitamins C and E hasn't been shown to have a benefit.	general
Some studies have reported an association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of preeclampsia.	general
But while some studies have shown an association between taking vitamin D supplements and a lower risk of preeclampsia, others have failed to make the connection.	general
In certain cases, however, you may be able to reduce your risk of preeclampsia with: If you meet certain risk factors ‚Äî including a history of preeclampsia, a multiple pregnancy, chronic high blood pressure, kidney disease, diabetes or autoimmune disease ‚Äî your doctor may recommend a daily low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams) beginning after 12 weeks of pregnancy.	general
Low-dose aspirin.	general
In some populations, women who have calcium deficiency before pregnancy ‚Äî and who don't get enough calcium during pregnancy through their diets ‚Äî might benefit from calcium supplements to prevent preeclampsia.	general
However, it's unlikely that women from the United States or other developed countries would have calcium deficiency to the degree that calcium supplements would benefit them.	general
Calcium supplements.	general
It's important that you don't take any medications, vitamins or supplements without first talking to your doctor.	general
Before you become pregnant, especially if you've had preeclampsia before, it's a good idea to be as healthy as you can be.	general
Lose weight if you need to, and make sure other conditions, such as diabetes, are well-managed.	general
Once you're pregnant, take care of yourself ‚Äî and your baby ‚Äî through early and regular prenatal care.	general
If preeclampsia is detected early, you and your doctor can work together to prevent complications and make the best choices for you and your baby.	general
Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart.	general
In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed.	general
This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs' arteries.	general
As the pressure builds, your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail.	general
Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious conditions that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal.	general
Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren't curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve your quality of life.	general
The signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension in its early stages might not be noticeable for months or even years.	general
As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse.	general
Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: Shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially while exercising and eventually while at rest Chest pressure or pain Swelling (edema) in your ankles, legs and eventually in your abdomen (ascites) Bluish color to your lips and skin (cyanosis) Racing pulse or heart palpitations Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).	general
Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery).	general
Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers.	general
The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood.	general
The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart.	general
The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.	general
In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen.	general
The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart.	general
Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs.	general
With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries.	general
These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form.	general
The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight.	general
These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels.	general
This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.	general
Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension When the tiny blood vessels in your lungs become thickened, narrowed, blocked or destroyed, there is increased resistance to blood flow through the lungs.	general
This results in higher pressures within the system, a condition known as pulmonary hypertension.	general
Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause.	general
Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension Certain drugs ‚Äî such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines ‚Äî or certain toxins Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease) Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs (interstitium) Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs Blood disorders Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension.	general
It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect.	general
This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart.	general
Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood).	general
The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension.	general
Risk factors Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: You're a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults You're overweight You have a family history of the disease You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine You take certain appetite-suppressant medications You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude Complications Pulmonary hypertension can lead to a number of complications, including: In cor pulmonale, your heart's right ventricle becomes enlarged and has to pump harder than usual to move blood through narrowed or blocked pulmonary arteries.	general
Right-sided heart enlargement and heart failure (cor pulmonale).	general
At first, the heart tries to compensate by thickening its walls and expanding the chamber of the right ventricle to increase the amount of blood it can hold.	general
But this thickening and enlarging works only temporarily, and eventually the right ventricle fails from the extra strain.	general
Clots help stop bleeding after you've been injured.	general
But sometimes clots form where they're not needed.	general
A number of small clots or just a few large ones dislodge from these veins and travel to the lungs, leading to a form of pulmonary hypertension that can generally be reversible with time and treatment.	general
Blood clots.	general
Having pulmonary hypertension makes it more likely you'll develop clots in the small arteries in your lungs, which is dangerous if you already have narrowed or blocked blood vessels.	general
Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) from the upper or lower chambers of the heart are complications of pulmonary hypertension.	general
These can lead to palpitations, dizziness or fainting and can be fatal.	general
Arrhythmia.	general
Pulmonary hypertension can lead to bleeding into the lungs and coughing up blood (hemoptysis).	general
This is another potentially fatal complication.	general
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine.	general
Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your body's metabolism, causing unintentional weight loss and a rapid or irregular heartbeat.	general
Several treatments are available for hyperthyroidism.	general
Doctors use anti-thyroid medications and radioactive iodine to slow the production of thyroid hormones.	general
Sometimes, hyperthyroidism treatment involves surgery to remove all or part of your thyroid gland.	general
Although hyperthyroidism can be serious if you ignore it, most people respond well once hyperthyroidism is diagnosed and treated.	general
Hyperthyroidism can mimic other health problems, which can make it difficult for your doctor to diagnose.	general
It can also cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms, including: Unintentional weight loss, even when your appetite and food intake stay the same or increase Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) ‚Äî commonly more than 100 beats a minute Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Increased appetite Tremor ‚Äî usually a fine trembling in your hands and fingers Changes in bowel patterns, especially more frequent bowel movements An enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), which may appear as a swelling at the base of your neck Fatigue, muscle weakness Fine, brittle hair Older adults are more likely to have either no signs or symptoms or subtle ones, such as an increased heart rate, heat intolerance and a tendency to become tired during ordinary activities.	general
Graves' ophthalmopathy Sometimes an uncommon problem called Graves' ophthalmopathy may affect your eyes, especially if you smoke.	general
This disorder makes your eyeballs protrude beyond their normal protective orbits when the tissues and muscles behind your eyes swell.	general
Eye problems often improve without treatment.	general
Signs and symptoms of Graves' ophthalmopathy include: Light sensitivity, blurry or double vision, inflammation, or reduced eye movement Protruding eyeballs When to see a doctor If you experience unexplained weight loss, a rapid heartbeat, unusual sweating, swelling at the base of your neck or other signs and symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism, see your doctor.	general
It's important to completely describe the changes you've observed, because many signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may be associated with a number of other conditions.	general
If you've been treated for hyperthyroidism or you currently are being treated, see your doctor regularly as advised so that he or she can monitor your condition.	general
Thyroid gland Thyroid gland Your thyroid gland is located at the base of your neck, just below the Adam's apple.	general
Hyperthyroidism can be caused by a number of conditions, including Graves' disease, Plummer's disease and thyroiditis.	general
Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your neck, just below your Adam's apple.	general
The thyroid gland has an enormous impact on your health.	general
Every aspect of your metabolism is regulated by thyroid hormones.	general
Your thyroid gland produces two main hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), that influence every cell in your body.	general
They maintain the rate at which your body uses fats and carbohydrates, help control your body temperature, influence your heart rate, and help regulate the production of protein.	general
Your thyroid also produces a hormone that helps regulate the amount of calcium in your blood (calcitonin).	general
Reasons for too much thyroxine (T4) Normally, your thyroid releases the right amount of hormones, but sometimes it produces too much T4.	general
This may occur for a number of reasons, including: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies produced by your immune system stimulate your thyroid to produce too much T4.	general
It's the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.	general
Graves' disease.	general
This form of hyperthyroidism occurs when one or more adenomas of your thyroid produce too much T4.	general
An adenoma is a part of the gland that has walled itself off from the rest of the gland, forming noncancerous (benign) lumps that may cause an enlargement of the thyroid.	general
Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules (toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter or Plummer's disease).	general
Sometimes your thyroid gland can become inflamed after pregnancy, due to an autoimmune condition or for unknown reasons.	general
The inflammation can cause excess thyroid hormone stored in the gland to leak into your bloodstream.	general
Some types of thyroiditis may cause pain, while others are painless.	general
Thyroiditis.	general
Risk factors A family history, particularly of Graves' disease A personal history of certain chronic illnesses, such as type 1 diabetes, pernicious anemia and primary adrenal insufficiency Complications Hyperthyroidism can lead to a number of complications: Some of the most serious complications of hyperthyroidism involve the heart.	general
These include a rapid heart rate, a heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation that increases your risk of stroke, and congestive heart failure ‚Äî a condition in which your heart can't circulate enough blood to meet your body's needs.	general
Heart problems.	general
Untreated hyperthyroidism can also lead to weak, brittle bones (osteoporosis).	general
The strength of your bones depends, in part, on the amount of calcium and other minerals they contain.	general
Too much thyroid hormone interferes with your body's ability to incorporate calcium into your bones.	general
Brittle bones.	general
People with Graves' ophthalmopathy develop eye problems, including bulging, red or swollen eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurring or double vision.	general
Untreated, severe eye problems can lead to vision loss.	general
Eye problems.	general
In rare cases, people with Graves' disease develop Graves' dermopathy.	general
This affects the skin, causing redness and swelling, often on the shins and feet.	general
Red, swollen skin.	general
Hyperthyroidism also places you at risk of thyrotoxic crisis ‚Äî a sudden intensification of your symptoms, leading to a fever, a rapid pulse and even delirium.	general
If this occurs, seek immediate medical care.	general
Thyrotoxic crisis.	general
Women's sexual desires naturally fluctuate over the years.	general
Highs and lows commonly coincide with the beginning or end of a relationship or with major life changes, such as pregnancy, menopause or illness.	general
Some medications used for mood disorders also can cause low sex drive in women.	general
If your lack of interest in sex continues or returns and causes personal distress, you may have a condition called hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).	general
But you don't have to meet this medical definition to seek help.	general
If you're bothered by a low sex drive or decreased sex drive, there are lifestyle changes and sexual techniques that may put you in the mood more often.	general
Some medications may offer promise as well.	general
Products & Services If you want to have sex less often than your partner does, neither one of you is necessarily outside the norm for people at your stage in life ‚Äî although your differences may cause distress.	general
Similarly, even if your sex drive is weaker than it once was, your relationship may be stronger than ever.	general
Bottom line: There is no magic number to define low sex drive.	general
It varies between women.	general
Symptoms of low sex drive in women include: Having no interest in any type of sexual activity, including masturbation Never or only seldom having sexual fantasies or thoughts Being concerned by your lack of sexual activity or fantasies When to see a doctor If you're concerned by your low desire for sex, talk to your doctorThe solution could be as simple as changing a medication you are taking, and improving any chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes.	general
Desire for sex is based on a complex interaction of many things affecting intimacy, including physical and emotional well-being, experiences, beliefs, lifestyle, and your current relationship.	general
If you're experiencing a problem in any of these areas, it can affect your desire for sex.	general
Physical causes A wide range of illnesses, physical changes and medications can cause a low sex drive, including: If you have pain during sex or can't orgasm, it can reduce your desire for sex.	general
Sexual problems.	general
Many nonsexual diseases can affect sex drive, including arthritis, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease and neurological diseases.	general
Medical diseases.	general
Certain prescription drugs, especially antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are known to lower the sex drive.	general
Medications.	general
A glass of wine may put you in the mood, but too much alcohol can affect your sex drive.	general
The same is true of street drugs.	general
Also, smoking decreases blood flow, which may dull arousal.	general
Lifestyle habits.	general
Any surgery related to your breasts or genital tract can affect your body image, sexual function and desire for sex.	general
Exhaustion from caring for young children or aging parents can contribute to low sex drive.	general
Fatigue from illness or surgery also can play a role in a low sex drive.	general
Hormone changes Changes in your hormone levels may alter your desire for sex.	general
This can occur during: Estrogen levels drop during the transition to menopause.	general
This can make you less interested in sex and cause dry vaginal tissues, resulting in painful or uncomfortable sex.	general
Although many women still have satisfying sex during menopause and beyond, some experience a lagging libido during this hormonal change.	general
Hormone changes during pregnancy, just after having a baby and during breast-feeding can put a damper on sex drive.	general
Fatigue, changes in body image, and the pressures of pregnancy or caring for a new baby also can contribute to changes in your sexual desire.	general
Pregnancy and breast-feeding.	general
Psychological causes Your state of mind can affect your sexual desire.	general
There are many psychological causes of low sex drive, including: Mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression Stress, such as financial stress or work stress Poor body image Previous negative sexual experiences Relationship issues For many women, emotional closeness is an essential prelude to sexual intimacy.	general
So problems in your relationship can be a major factor in low sex drive.	general
Hyponatremia occurs when the concentration of sodium in your blood is abnormally low.	general
Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that's in and around your cells.	general
In hyponatremia, one or more factors ‚Äî ranging from an underlying medical condition to drinking too much water ‚Äî cause the sodium in your body to become diluted.	general
When this happens, your body's water levels rise, and your cells begin to swell.	general
This swelling can cause many health problems, from mild to life-threatening.	general
Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at resolving the underlying condition.	general
Depending on the cause of hyponatremia, you may simply need to cut back on how much you drink.	general
In other cases of hyponatremia, you may need intravenous electrolyte solutions and medications.	general
Nausea and vomiting Restlessness and irritability When to see a doctor Seek emergency care for anyone who develops severe signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, such as nausea and vomiting, confusion, seizures, or lost consciousness.	general
Call your doctor if you know you are at risk of hyponatremia and are experiencing nausea, headaches, cramping or weakness.	general
Depending on the extent and duration of these signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend seeking immediate medical care.	general
Sodium plays a key role in your body.	general
It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance.	general
A normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L).	general
Hyponatremia occurs when the sodium in your blood falls below 135 mEq/L.	general
Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors can lead to hyponatremia, including: Some medications, such as some water pills (diuretics), antidepressants and pain medications, can interfere with the normal hormonal and kidney processes that keep sodium concentrations within the healthy normal range.	general
Certain medications.	general
Congestive heart failure and certain diseases affecting the kidneys or liver can cause fluids to accumulate in your body, which dilutes the sodium in your body, lowering the overall level.	general
Heart, kidney and liver problems.	general
In this condition, high levels of the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) are produced, causing your body to retain water instead of excreting it normally in your urine.	general
Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH).	general
This causes your body to lose electrolytes, such as sodium, and also increases ADH levels.	general
Chronic, severe vomiting or diarrhea and other causes of dehydration.	general
Drinking excessive amounts of water can cause low sodium by overwhelming the kidneys' ability to excrete water.	general
Because you lose sodium through sweat, drinking too much water during endurance activities, such as marathons and triathlons, can also dilute the sodium content of your blood.	general
Drinking too much water.	general
Adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison's disease) affects your adrenal glands' ability to produce hormones that help maintain your body's balance of sodium, potassium and water.	general
Low levels of thyroid hormone also can cause a low blood-sodium level.	general
Hormonal changes.	general
This amphetamine increases the risk of severe and even fatal cases of hyponatremia.	general
The recreational drug Ecstasy.	general
Risk factors The following factors may increase your risk of hyponatremia: Older adults may have more contributing factors for hyponatremia, including age-related changes, taking certain medications and a greater likelihood of developing a chronic disease that alters the body's sodium balance.	general
Medications that increase your risk of hyponatremia include thiazide diuretics as well as some antidepressants and pain medications.	general
In addition, the recreational drug Ecstasy has been linked to fatal cases of hyponatremia.	general
Certain drugs.	general
Medical conditions that may increase your risk of hyponatremia include kidney disease, syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and heart failure, among others.	general
Conditions that decrease your body's water excretion.	general
People who drink too much water while taking part in marathons, ultramarathons, triathlons and other long-distance, high-intensity activities are at an increased risk of hyponatremia.	general
Intensive physical activities.	general
Complications In chronic hyponatremia, sodium levels drop gradually over 48 hours or longer ‚Äî and symptoms and complications are typically more moderate.	general
In acute hyponatremia, sodium levels drop rapidly ‚Äî resulting in potentially dangerous effects, such as rapid brain swelling, which can result in a coma and death.	general
Premenopausal women appear to be at the greatest risk of hyponatremia-related brain damage.	general
This may be related to the effect of women's sex hormones on the body's ability to balance sodium levels.	general
The following measures may help you prevent hyponatremia: Getting treatment for conditions that contribute to hyponatremia, such as adrenal gland insufficiency, can help prevent low blood sodium.	general
Treat associated conditions.	general
If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of hyponatremia or you take diuretic medications, be aware of the signs and symptoms of low blood sodium.	general
Always talk with your doctor about the risks of a new medication.	general
Educate yourself.	general
Athletes should drink only as much fluid as they lose due to sweating during a race.	general
Thirst is generally a good guide to how much water or other fluids you need.	general
Take precautions during high-intensity activities.	general
Ask your doctor about replacing water with sports beverages that contain electrolytes when participating in endurance events such as marathons, triathlons and other demanding activities.	general
Consider drinking sports beverages during demanding activities.	general
Drinking water is vital for your health, so make sure you drink enough fluids.	general
But don't overdo it.	general
Thirst and the color of your urine are usually the best indications of how much water you need.	general
If you're not thirsty and your urine is pale yellow, you are likely getting enough water.	general
Drink water in moderation.	general
Parathyroid glands Parathyroid glands The parathyroid glands, which lie behind the thyroid, manufacture the parathyroid hormone, which plays a role in regulating your body's levels of the minerals calcium and phosphorus.	general
Hypoparathyroidism is an uncommon condition in which your body secretes abnormally low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH).	general
PTH is key to regulating and maintaining a balance of your body's levels of two minerals ‚Äî calcium and phosphorus.	general
The low production of PTH in hypoparathyroidism leads to abnormally low calcium levels in your blood and bones and to an increase of phosphorus in your blood.	general
Supplements to normalize your calcium and phosphorus levels treat the condition.	general
Depending on the cause of your hypoparathyroidism, you'll likely need to take supplements for life.	general
Tingling or burning (paresthesia) in your fingertips, toes and lips Muscle aches or cramps in your legs, feet, abdomen or face Twitching or spasms of your muscles, particularly around your mouth, but also in your hands, arms and throat Fatigue or weakness When to see a doctor If you have signs or symptoms associated with hypoparathyroidism, see your doctor for an evaluation.	general
Contact your doctor immediately if you have a seizure or have difficulty breathing, both of which can be complications of hypoparathyroidism.	general
Hypoparathyroidism occurs when your parathyroid glands don't secrete enough parathyroid hormone.	general
You have four small parathyroid glands situated in your neck, behind your thyroid gland.	general
Factors that can cause hypoparathyroidism include: This most common cause of hypoparathyroidism develops after accidental damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands during surgery.	general
This surgery might be a treatment for diseases of the thyroid gland, or for throat or neck cancer.	general
Post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.	general
Your immune system creates antibodies against the parathyroid tissues, trying to reject them as if they were foreign bodies.	general
In the process, the parathyroid glands stop manufacturing their hormone.	general
Autoimmune disease.	general
In this form, either you're born without parathyroid glands or they don't work properly.	general
Some types of hereditary hypoparathyroidism are associated with deficiencies of other hormone-producing glands.	general
Hereditary hypoparathyroidism.	general
Radiation can result in destruction of your parathyroid glands, as can radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism, occasionally.	general
Extensive cancer radiation treatment of your face or neck.	general
which can affect the function of your parathyroid glands.	general
Normal magnesium levels are required for optimum secretion of parathyroid hormone.	general
Low levels of magnesium in your blood, Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of developing hypoparathyroidism include: Recent neck surgery, particularly if the thyroid was involved A family history of hypoparathyroidism Having certain autoimmune or endocrine conditions, such as Addison's disease ‚Äî which causes your adrenal glands to produce too little of its hormones Complications Reversible complications The following are due to low calcium levels, most of which are likely to improve with treatment: These cramplike spasms of your hands and fingers can be prolonged and painful.	general
Tetany might also include muscle discomfort and twitches or spasms of the muscles of your face, throat or arms.	general
When these spasms occur in your throat, they can interfere with breathing, creating a possible emergency.	general
These are characterized by odd, tingling sensations or pins and needles feelings in your lips, tongue, fingers and toes.	general
Paresthesias.	general
(grand mal seizures).	general
Loss of consciousness with convulsions affecting dental enamel and roots.	general
Malformed teeth, Impaired kidney function.	general
Irreversible complications Accurate diagnosis and treatment might prevent these complications associated with hypoparathyroidism.	general
But once they occur, calcium and vitamin D won't improve them: Stunted growth (short stature) Slow mental development in children Calcium deposits in the brain, which can cause balance problems and seizures There are no specific actions to prevent hypoparathyroidism.	general
However, if you're scheduled to have thyroid or neck surgery, talk to your surgeon about the risk of damage to your parathyroid glands during the procedure.	general
If you've had surgery involving your thyroid or neck, watch for signs and symptoms that could indicate hypoparathyroidism, such as a tingling or burning sensation in your fingers, toes or lips, or muscle twitching or cramping.	general
If they occur, your doctor might recommend prompt treatment with calcium and vitamin D to minimize the effects of the disorder.	general
Pituitary gland and hypothalamus Pituitary gland and hypothalamus The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are located within the brain and control hormone production.	general
Endocrine system Endocrine system The endocrine system includes the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, pancreas, ovaries (in women) and testicles (in men).	general
Hypopituitarism is a rare disorder in which your pituitary gland fails to produce one or more hormones, or doesn't produce enough hormones.	general
The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland situated at the base of your brain.	general
It is part of your body's endocrine system, which consists of all the glands that produce and regulate hormones.	general
Despite its small size, the pituitary gland creates and releases a number of hormones that act on nearly every part of your body.	general
Hypopituitarism is when you have a short supply (deficiency) of one or more of the pituitary hormones.	general
These hormone deficiencies can affect any number of your body's routine functions, such as growth, blood pressure or reproduction.	general
Symptoms typically vary, based on which hormone or hormones you are missing.	general
If you have hypopituitarism, you'll likely need to take medication for the rest of your life.	general
Medication helps replace the missing hormones, which helps control your symptoms.	general
The signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism usually develop gradually and get worse over time.	general
They are sometimes subtle and may be overlooked for months or even years.	general
But for some people, signs and symptoms develop suddenly.	general
Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person, depending on which pituitary hormones are affected and to what degree.	general
In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptoms of the first deficiency.	general
Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, deficiency may cause growth problems and short stature.	general
Most adults who have deficiency don't have any symptoms, but for some adults it can cause: Lack of ambition Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affect the reproductive system.	general
In women, the deficiency decreases egg and estrogen production from the ovaries.	general
In men, the deficiency decreases sperm and testosterone production from the testicles.	general
Women and men may experience a lower sex drive, infertility or fatigue.	general
In children and adolescents, delayed puberty is usually the only symptom.	general
Women may also have symptoms such as: Hot flashes Erectile dysfunction Mood changes Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency This hormone controls the thyroid gland.	general
A deficiency leads to low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism).	general
This causes symptoms such as: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency This hormone helps your adrenal glands work properly, and helps your body react to stress.	general
Symptoms of deficiency include: Severe fatigue Frequent and prolonged infections Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency This hormone, which is also called vasopressin, helps your body balance its fluid levels.	general
An deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause: Excessive urination Extreme thirst Electrolyte imbalances Prolactin deficiency Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk.	general
Low levels of prolactin can cause women to have problems making milk for breast-feeding.	general
When to see a doctor you develop any of the signs and symptoms associated with hypopituitarism.	general
See your doctor if signs or symptoms of hypopituitarism develop suddenly or are associated with a severe headache, visual disturbances, confusion or a drop in blood pressure.	general
These could be signs and symptoms of sudden destruction of the pituitary gland tissue (pituitary apoplexy), often caused by bleeding into the pituitary gland.	general
Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency and requires prompt medical attention.	general
Contact your doctor immediately if Hypopituitarism has a number of causes.	general
In many cases, hypopituitarism is caused by a tumor of the pituitary gland.	general
As a pituitary tumor increases in size, it can compress and damage pituitary tissue, interfering with hormone production.	general
A tumor can also compress the optic nerves, causing visual disturbances.	general
In addition to tumors, certain diseases or events that cause damage to the pituitary gland may also trigger hypopituitarism.	general
Examples include: Head injuries Brain surgery Radiation treatment to the head or neck Lack of blood flow to the brain or pituitary gland (stroke) or bleeding (hemorrhage) into the brain or pituitary gland Certain medications, such as narcotics, high-dose corticosteroids or certain cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors Inflammation of the pituitary gland caused by an abnormal immune system response (hypophysitis) Infections of the brain, such as meningitis, or infections that can spread to the brain, such as tuberculosis or syphilis Infiltrative diseases, which affect multiple parts of the body, including sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease occurring in various organs; Langerhans cell histiocytosis, in which abnormal cells cause scarring in numerous parts of the body; and hemochromatosis, which causes excess iron deposits in the liver and other tissues Severe loss of blood during childbirth, which may cause damage to the front part of the pituitary gland (Sheehan's syndrome or postpartum pituitary necrosis) In some cases, hypopituitarism is caused by a genetic mutation (inherited).	general
These mutations affect the pituitary gland's ability to produce one or more of its hormones, often starting at birth or in early childhood.	general
Tumors or diseases of the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain situated just above the pituitary, also can cause hypopituitarism.	general
The hypothalamus produces hormones of its own that directly affect the activity of the pituitary gland.	general
In some cases, the cause of hypopituitarism is unknown.	general
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a complex and rare heart defect present at birth (congenital).	general
The left side of the heart is critically underdeveloped in hypoplastic left heart syndrome.	general
If your baby is born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart can't effectively pump blood to the body.	general
Instead, the right side of the heart must pump blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body.	general
Medication to prevent closure of the connection (ductus arteriosus) between the right and left sides, followed by either surgery or a heart transplant, is necessary to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome.	general
With advances in care, the outlook for babies born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome is better now than in the past.	general
Products & Services Babies born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome usually are seriously ill soon after birth.	general
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome symptoms include: Grayish-blue skin color (cyanosis) Being unusually drowsy or inactive If the natural connections between the heart's left and right sides (foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus) are allowed to close in the first few days of life in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, he or she can go into shock and may die.	general
Signs of shock include: Cool, clammy skin that may be pale or gray A weak and rapid pulse Abnormal breathing that may be either slow and shallow or very rapid Lackluster eyes that seem to stare A baby who is in shock may be conscious or unconscious.	general
If you suspect your baby is in shock, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number.	general
When to see a doctor It's likely that your baby would be diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome either before birth or soon after.	general
However, you should seek medical help if you notice that your baby has the following symptoms: Grayish-blue skin color Rapid, difficult breathing Being unusually drowsy or inactive If your baby has any of the following signs of shock, call 911 or your local emergency number right away: Cool, clammy skin that may be pale or gray A weak and rapid pulse Abnormal breathing that may be either slow and shallow or very rapid Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers.	general
The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood.	general
The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart.	general
The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.	general
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs during fetal growth when the baby's heart is developing.	general
The cause is unknown.	general
However, if your family has one child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the risk of having another with a similar condition is increased.	general
A normal heart has four chambers, two on the right and two on the left.	general
In performing its basic job ‚Äî pumping blood throughout the body ‚Äî the heart uses its left and right sides for different tasks.	general
The right side moves blood to the lungs.	general
In the lungs, oxygen enriches the blood, which then circulates to the heart's left side.	general
The left side of the heart pumps blood into a large vessel called the aorta, which circulates the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.	general
What happens in hypoplastic left heart syndrome Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Hypoplastic left heart syndrome In this condition, the left side of the heart ‚Äî including the aorta, aortic valve, left ventricle and mitral valve ‚Äî is underdeveloped (hypoplastic).	general
As a result, the body doesn't receive enough oxygenated blood.	general
In hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart can't properly supply blood to the body because the lower left chamber (left ventricle) is too small or in some cases may not even exist.	general
In addition, the valves on the left side of the heart (aortic valve and mitral valve) don't work properly, and the main artery leaving the heart (aorta) is smaller than normal.	general
For the first several days of life, the right side of the heart can pump blood both to the lungs and to the rest of the body through a blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta (ductus arteriosus).	general
The oxygen-rich blood returns to the right side of the heart through a natural opening (foramen ovale) between the right chambers of the heart (atria).	general
"When the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus are open, they are referred to as being ""patent""."	general
If the ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale close ‚Äî which they normally do after the first day or two of life ‚Äî the right side of the heart has no way to pump blood out to the body.	general
Keeping these connections open with medication is necessary for survival in the first few days of life in babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.	general
This will keep blood flowing to the body until heart surgery is performed.	general
HLHS: A Child's Perspective Risk factors If you already have a child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, you have a higher risk of having another baby with this condition or a similar condition.	general
Beyond family history, there are no clear risk factors for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.	general
Complications Without surgery, hypoplastic left heart syndrome is fatal, usually within the first few weeks of life.	general
With treatment, many babies survive, although most will have complications later in life.	general
Some of the complications may include: Tiring easily when participating in sports or other exercise Heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) Fluid buildup in the lungs, abdomen, legs and feet (edema) Growth restriction Formation of blood clots that may lead to a pulmonary embolism or stroke Developmental problems related to the brain and nervous system Need for additional heart surgery or transplantation There's no known cause of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, so there's no known way to prevent the condition.	general
If you have a family history of heart defects, or if you already have a child with a congenital heart defect, before getting pregnant consider talking with a genetic counselor and a cardiologist experienced in congenital heart defects.	general
Hypospadias Hypospadias Hypospadias is a condition in which the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip.	general
The location of the opening can vary and can be anywhere from underneath the tip of the penis (more common) to the base of the penis (less common).	general
Hypospadias (hi-poe-SPAY-dee-us) is a birth defect (congenital condition) in which the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip.	general
The urethra is the tube through which urine drains from your bladder and exits your body.	general
Hypospadias is common and doesn't cause difficulty in caring for your infant.	general
Surgery usually restores the normal appearance of your child's penis.	general
With successful treatment of hypospadias, most males can have normal urination and reproduction.	general
Products & Services In hypospadias, the opening of the urethra is located on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip.	general
In most cases, the opening of the urethra is within the head of the penis.	general
Less often, the opening is at the middle or the base of the penis.	general
Rarely, the opening is in or beneath the scrotum.	general
Signs and symptoms of hypospadias may include: Opening of the urethra at a location other than the tip of the penis Downward curve of the penis (chordee) Hooded appearance of the penis because only the top half of the penis is covered by foreskin Abnormal spraying during urination When to see a doctor Most infants with hypospadias are diagnosed soon after birth while still in the hospital.	general
However, slight displacement of the urethral opening may be subtle and more difficult to identify.	general
Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about the appearance of your child's penis or if there are problems with urination.	general
Hypospadias is present at birth (congenital).	general
As the penis develops in a male fetus, certain hormones stimulate the formation of the urethra and foreskin.	general
Hypospadias results when a malfunction occurs in the action of these hormones, causing the urethra to develop abnormally.	general
In most cases, the exact cause of hypospadias is unknown.	general
Sometimes, hypospadias is genetic, but environment also may play a role.	general
Risk factors Although the cause of hypospadias is usually unknown, these factors may be associated with the condition: This condition is more common in infants with a family history of hypospadias.	general
Family history.	general
Certain gene variations may play a role in disruption of the hormones that stimulate formation of the male genitals.	general
Some research suggests that there may be an increased risk of hypospadias in infant males born to women older than 35 years.	general
Maternal age over 35.	general
There is some speculation about an association between hypospadias and a mother's exposure to certain hormones or certain compounds such as pesticides or industrial chemicals, but further studies are needed to confirm this.	general
Exposure to certain substances during pregnancy.	general
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.	general
Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages.	general
Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease.	general
Accurate thyroid function tests are available to diagnose hypothyroidism.	general
Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is usually simple, safe and effective once you and your doctor find the right dose for you.	general
Thyroid gland Thyroid gland Your thyroid gland is located at the base of your neck, just below the Adam's apple.	general
The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary, depending on the severity of the hormone deficiency.	general
Problems tend to develop slowly, often over a number of years.	general
At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain.	general
Or you may simply attribute them to getting older.	general
But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems.	general
Hypothyroidism signs and symptoms may include: Pain, stiffness or swelling in your joints Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods Thinning hair Hypothyroidism in infants Although hypothyroidism most often affects middle-aged and older women, anyone can develop the condition, including infants.	general
Initially, babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work properly may have few signs and symptoms.	general
When newborns do have problems with hypothyroidism, the problems may include: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).	general
In most cases, this occurs when a baby's liver can't metabolize a substance called bilirubin, which normally forms when the body recycles old or damaged red blood cells.	general
A large, protruding tongue.	general
An umbilical hernia.	general
As the disease progresses, infants are likely to have trouble feeding and may fail to grow and develop normally.	general
They may also have: Constipation Excessive sleepiness When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental retardation.	general
Hypothyroidism in children and teens In general, children and teens who develop hypothyroidism have the same signs and symptoms as adults do, but they may also experience: Poor growth, resulting in short stature Delayed development of permanent teeth Delayed puberty When to see a doctor See your doctor if you're feeling tired for no reason or have any of the other signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as dry skin, a pale, puffy face, constipation or a hoarse voice.	general
If you're receiving hormone therapy for hypothyroidism, schedule follow-up visits as often as your doctor recommends.	general
Initially, it's important to make sure you're receiving the correct dose of medicine.	general
And over time, the dose you need may change.	general
More Information When your thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones, the balance of chemical reactions in your body can be upset.	general
There can be a number of causes, including autoimmune disease, hyperthyroidism treatments, radiation therapy, thyroid surgery and certain medications.	general
Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland situated at the base of the front of your neck, just below your Adam's apple.	general
Hormones produced by the thyroid gland ‚Äî triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) ‚Äî have an enormous impact on your health, affecting all aspects of your metabolism.	general
These hormones also influence the control of vital functions, such as body temperature and heart rate.	general
Hypothyroidism results when the thyroid gland fails to produce enough hormones.	general
Hypothyroidism may be due to a number of factors, including: The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis.	general
Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system produces antibodies that attack your own tissues.	general
Sometimes this process involves your thyroid gland.	general
Autoimmune disease.	general
Scientists aren't sure why this happens, but it's likely a combination of factors, such as your genes and an environmental trigger.	general
However it happens, these antibodies affect the thyroid's ability to produce hormones.	general
People who produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) are often treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications.	general
The goal of these treatments is to get thyroid function back to normal.	general
But sometimes, correcting hyperthyroidism can end up lowering thyroid hormone production too much, resulting in permanent hypothyroidism.	general
Over-response to hyperthyroidism treatment.	general
Removing all or a large portion of your thyroid gland can diminish or halt hormone production.	general
In that case, you'll need to take thyroid hormone for life.	general
Thyroid surgery.	general
Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect your thyroid gland and may lead to hypothyroidism.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
A number of medications can contribute to hypothyroidism.	general
One such medication is lithium, which is used to treat certain psychiatric disorders.	general
If you're taking medication, ask your doctor about its effect on your thyroid gland.	general
Medications.	general
Less often, hypothyroidism may result from one of the following: Some babies are born with a defective thyroid gland or no thyroid gland.	general
In most cases, the thyroid gland didn't develop normally for unknown reasons, but some children have an inherited form of the disorder.	general
Often, infants with congenital hypothyroidism appear normal at birth.	general
That's one reason why most states now require newborn thyroid screening.	general
Congenital disease.	general
A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to produce enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) ‚Äî usually because of a benign tumor of the pituitary gland.	general
Pituitary disorder.	general
Some women develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy (postpartum hypothyroidism), often because they produce antibodies to their own thyroid gland.	general
Left untreated, hypothyroidism increases the risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and preeclampsia ‚Äî a condition that causes a significant rise in a woman's blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy.	general
It can also seriously affect the developing fetus.	general
The trace mineral iodine ‚Äî found primarily in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt ‚Äî is essential for the production of thyroid hormones.	general
Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, and too much iodine can worsen hypothyroidism in people who already have the condition.	general
In some parts of the world, iodine deficiency is common, but the addition of iodine to table salt has virtually eliminated this problem in the United States.	general
Iodine deficiency.	general
Risk factors Although anyone can develop hypothyroidism, you're at an increased risk if you: Are a woman Have a family history of thyroid disease Have an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease Have been treated with radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications Received radiation to your neck or upper chest Have had thyroid surgery (partial thyroidectomy) Have been pregnant or delivered a baby within the past six months Complications Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to a number of health problems: Constant stimulation of your thyroid to release more hormones may cause the gland to become larger ‚Äî a condition known as a goiter.	general
Although generally not uncomfortable, a large goiter can affect your appearance and may interfere with swallowing or breathing.	general
"Hypothyroidism may also be associated with an increased risk of heart disease and heart failure, primarily because high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ‚Äî the ""bad"" cholesterol ‚Äî can occur in people with an underactive thyroid."	general
Heart problems.	general
Depression may occur early in hypothyroidism and may become more severe over time.	general
Hypothyroidism can also cause slowed mental functioning.	general
Mental health issues.	general
Long-term uncontrolled hypothyroidism can cause damage to your peripheral nerves.	general
These are the nerves that carry information from your brain and spinal cord to the rest of your body ‚Äî for example, your arms and legs.	general
Peripheral neuropathy may cause pain, numbness and tingling in affected areas.	general
Peripheral neuropathy.	general
This rare, life-threatening condition is the result of long-term, undiagnosed hypothyroidism.	general
Its signs and symptoms include intense cold intolerance and drowsiness followed by profound lethargy and unconsciousness.	general
A myxedema coma may be triggered by sedatives, infection or other stress on your body.	general
If you have signs or symptoms of myxedema, you need immediate emergency medical treatment.	general
Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which impairs fertility.	general
In addition, some of the causes of hypothyroidism ‚Äî such as autoimmune disorder ‚Äî can also impair fertility.	general
Infertility.	general
Babies born to women with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of birth defects compared to babies born to healthy mothers.	general
These children are also more prone to serious intellectual and developmental problems.	general
Birth defects.	general
Infants with untreated hypothyroidism present at birth are at risk of serious problems with both physical and mental development.	general
But if this condition is diagnosed within the first few months of life, the chances of normal development are excellent.	general
Digestive system Digestive system Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both forms of inflammatory bowel disease.	general
Crohn's disease most commonly affects the colon and the last part of the small intestine (ileum).	general
Ulcerative colitis affects the colon.	general
This condition causes long-lasting inflammation and sores (ulcers) in the innermost lining of your large intestine (colon) and rectum.	general
Ulcerative colitis.	general
This type of IBD is characterized by inflammation of the lining of your digestive tract, which often spreads deep into affected tissues.	general
Crohn's disease.	general
Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease usually involve severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss.	general
IBD can be debilitating and sometimes leads to life-threatening complications.	general
Inflammatory bowel disease symptoms vary, depending on the severity of inflammation and where it occurs.	general
Symptoms may range from mild to severe.	general
You are likely to have periods of active illness followed by periods of remission.	general
Signs and symptoms that are common to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis include: When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience a persistent change in your bowel habits or if you have any of the signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.	general
Although inflammatory bowel disease usually isn't fatal, it's a serious disease that, in some cases, may cause life-threatening complications.	general
The exact cause of inflammatory bowel disease remains unknown.	general
Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate but don't cause IBD.	general
One possible cause is an immune system malfunction.	general
When your immune system tries to fight off an invading virus or bacterium, an abnormal immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too.	general
Heredity also seems to play a role in that IBD is more common in people who have family members with the disease.	general
However, most people with IBD don't have this family history.	general
Risk factors Most people who develop IBD are diagnosed before they're 30 years old.	general
But some people don't develop the disease until their 50s or 60s.	general
Although whites have the highest risk of the disease, it can occur in any race.	general
If you're of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, your risk is even higher.	general
Race or ethnicity.	general
You're at higher risk if you have a close relative ‚Äî such as a parent, sibling or child ‚Äî with the disease.	general
Family history.	general
Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn's disease.	general
Although smoking may provide some protection against ulcerative colitis, the overall health benefits of not smoking make it important to try to quit.	general
Cigarette smoking.	general
These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium (Voltaren) and others.	general
These medications may increase the risk of developing IBD or worsen disease in people who have IBD.	general
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.	general
If you live in an industrialized country, you're more likely to develop IBD.	general
Therefore, it may be that environmental factors, including a diet high in fat or refined foods, play a role.	general
People living in northern climates also seem to be at greater risk.	general
Where you live.	general
Complications Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have some complications in common and others that are specific to each condition.	general
Complications found in both conditions may include: Having IBD increases your risk of colon cancer.	general
General colon cancer screening guidelines for people without IBD call for a colonoscopy every 10 years beginning at age 50.	general
Ask your doctor whether you need to have this test done sooner and more frequently.	general
Colon cancer.	general
Certain disorders, including arthritis, skin lesions and eye inflammation (uveitis), may occur during IBD flare-ups.	general
Skin, eye and joint inflammation.	general
Certain medications for IBD are associated with a small risk of developing certain cancers.	general
Corticosteroids can be associated with a risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure and other conditions.	general
Medication side effects.	general
In this condition, inflammation causes scars within the bile ducts, eventually making them narrow and gradually causing liver damage.	general
Primary sclerosing cholangitis.	general
IBD increases the risk of blood clots in veins and arteries.	general
Blood clots.	general
Complications of Crohn's disease may include: Crohn's disease affects the full thickness of the intestinal wall.	general
Over time, parts of the bowel can thicken and narrow, which may block the flow of digestive contents.	general
You may require surgery to remove the diseased portion of your bowel.	general
Bowel obstruction.	general
Diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping may make it difficult for you to eat or for your intestine to absorb enough nutrients to keep you nourished.	general
It's also common to develop anemia due to low iron or vitamin B12 caused by the disease.	general
Malnutrition.	general
Chronic inflammation can lead to open sores (ulcers) anywhere in your digestive tract, including your mouth and anus, and in the genital area (perineum).	general
Sometimes ulcers can extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a fistula ‚Äî an abnormal connection between different body parts.	general
Fistulas near or around the anal area (perianal) are the most common kind.	general
In some cases, a fistula may become infected and form an abscess.	general
This is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus where infections can occur.	general
It's often associated with painful bowel movements and may lead to a perianal fistula.	general
Anal fissure.	general
Complications of ulcerative colitis may include: Ulcerative colitis may cause the colon to rapidly widen and swell, a serious condition known as toxic megacolon.	general
Toxic megacolon.	general
A perforated colon most commonly is caused by toxic megacolon, but it may also occur on its own.	general
A hole in the colon (perforated colon).	general
Excessive diarrhea can result in dehydration.	general
Severe dehydration.	general
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that affects the large intestine.	general
Signs and symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea or constipation, or both.	general
IBS is a chronic condition that you'll need to manage long term.	general
Only a small number of people with IBS have severe signs and symptoms.	general
Some people can control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and stress.	general
More-severe symptoms can be treated with medication and counseling.	general
IBS doesn't cause changes in bowel tissue or increase your risk of colorectal cancer.	general
Products & Services The signs and symptoms of IBS vary.	general
The most common include: Abdominal pain, cramping or bloating that is typically relieved or partially relieved by passing a bowel movement Mucus in the stool Most people with IBS experience times when the signs and symptoms are worse and times when they improve or even disappear completely.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have a persistent change in bowel habits or other signs or symptoms of IBS.	general
They may indicate a more serious condition, such as colon cancer.	general
More-serious signs and symptoms include: Weight loss Unexplained vomiting Difficulty swallowing Persistent pain that isn't relieved by passing gas or a bowel movement The precise cause of IBS isn't known.	general
Factors that appear to play a role include: The walls of the intestines are lined with layers of muscle that contract as they move food through your digestive tract.	general
Contractions that are stronger and last longer than normal can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea.	general
Weak intestinal contractions can slow food passage and lead to hard, dry stools.	general
Muscle contractions in the intestine.	general
Abnormalities in the nerves in your digestive system may cause you to experience greater than normal discomfort when your abdomen stretches from gas or stool.	general
Poorly coordinated signals between the brain and the intestines can cause your body to overreact to changes that normally occur in the digestive process, resulting in pain, diarrhea or constipation.	general
Nervous system.	general
Some people with IBS have an increased number of immune-system cells in their intestines.	general
This immune-system response is associated with pain and diarrhea.	general
Inflammation in the intestines.	general
IBS can develop after a severe bout of diarrhea (gastroenteritis) caused by bacteria or a virus.	general
IBS might also be associated with a surplus of bacteria in the intestines (bacterial overgrowth).	general
Severe infection.	general
"Microflora are the ""good"" bacteria that reside in the intestines and play a key role in health."	general
Research indicates that microflora in people with IBS might differ from microflora in healthy people.	general
Changes in bacteria in the gut (microflora).	general
Symptoms of IBS can be triggered by: The role of food allergy or intolerance in IBS isn't fully understood.	general
A true food allergy rarely causes IBS.	general
But many people have worse IBS symptoms when they eat or drink certain foods or beverages, including wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, milk and carbonated drinks.	general
Most people with IBS experience worse or more frequent signs and symptoms during periods of increased stress.	general
But while stress may aggravate symptoms, it doesn't cause them.	general
Women are twice as likely to have IBS, which might indicate that hormonal changes play a role.	general
Many women find that signs and symptoms are worse during or around their menstrual periods.	general
More Information Risk factors Many people have occasional signs and symptoms of IBS.	general
But you're more likely to have the syndrome if you: IBS occurs more frequently in people under age 50.	general
In the United States, IBS is more common among women.	general
Estrogen therapy before or after menopause also is a risk factor for IBS.	general
Are female.	general
Genes may play a role, as may shared factors in a family's environment or a combination of genes and environment.	general
Have a family history of IBS.	general
Anxiety, depression and other mental health issues are associated with IBS.	general
A history of sexual, physical or emotional abuse also might be a risk factor.	general
Have a mental health problem.	general
Complications In addition, IBS is associated with: Many people with moderate to severe IBS report poor quality of life.	general
Research indicates that people with IBS miss three times as many days from work as do those without bowel symptoms.	general
Poor quality of life.	general
Experiencing the signs and symptoms of IBS can lead to depression or anxiety.	general
Depression and anxiety also can make IBS worse.	general
Mood disorders.	general
Finding ways to deal with stress may help prevent or ease symptoms of IBS.	general
Consider trying: A counselor can help you learn to modify or change your responses to stress.	general
Studies have shown that psychotherapy can provide significant and long-lasting reduction of symptoms.	general
Counseling.	general
Electrical sensors help you receive information (feedback) on your body's functions.	general
The feedback helps you focus on making subtle changes, such as relaxing certain muscles, to ease symptoms.	general
Biofeedback.	general
These exercises help you relax muscles in your body, one by one.	general
Start by tightening the muscles in your feet, then concentrate on slowly letting all of the tension go.	general
Next, tighten and relax your calves.	general
Continue until the muscles in your body, including those in your eyes and scalp, are relaxed.	general
Progressive relaxation exercises.	general
This stress-reduction technique helps you focus on being in the moment and letting go of worries and distractions.	general
Mindfulness training.	general
Ichthyosis vulgaris Ichthyosis vulgaris Ichthyosis vulgaris develops when skin cells fail to shed normally and instead accumulate in thick, dry scales.	general
People with darker skin tend to have darker colored scales, as shown here.	general
Ichthyosis vulgaris (ik-thee-O-sis vul-GAY-ris) is an inherited skin disorder in which dead skin cells accumulate in thick, dry scales on your skin's surface.	general
The scales of ichthyosis vulgaris, sometimes called fish scale disease or fish skin disease, can be present at birth, but usually first appear during early childhood.	general
Sometimes, mild cases of ichthyosis vulgaris go undiagnosed because they're mistaken for extremely dry skin.	general
Most cases of ichthyosis vulgaris are mild, but some are severe.	general
Sometimes other skin diseases, such as the allergic skin condition eczema, are associated with ichthyosis vulgaris.	general
No cure has been found for ichthyosis vulgaris, and treatments focus on controlling the condition.	general
Ichthyosis scales Ichthyosis scales Ichthyosis vulgaris is characterized by dry skin with small scales in a color range from white to dirty gray or brown.	general
Ichthyosis vulgaris slows your skin's natural shedding process.	general
This causes chronic, excessive buildup of the protein in the upper layer of the skin (keratin).	general
Symptoms include: Dry, scaly skin Tile-like, small scales Scales colored white, dirty gray or brown ‚Äî with darker-colored scales typically on darker skin Flaky scalp Deep, painful cracks in your skin The scales usually appear on your elbows and lower legs and may be especially thick and dark over your shins.	general
Most cases of ichthyosis vulgaris are mild, but some can be severe.	general
The severity of symptoms may vary widely among family members who have the condition.	general
Symptoms usually worsen or are more pronounced in cold, dry environments and tend to improve or even resolve in warm, humid environments.	general
When to see a doctor If you suspect you or your child has ichthyosis vulgaris, talk to your family doctor or a dermatologist.	general
He or she can diagnose the condition by examining the characteristic scales.	general
Also be sure to seek medical advice if the symptoms worsen or don't improve with self-care measures.	general
You may need stronger medication to manage the condition.	general
Ichthyosis vulgaris is commonly caused by a genetic mutation that's inherited from one or both parents.	general
Children who inherit a defective gene from just one parent have a milder form of the disease.	general
Those who inherit two defective genes have a more severe form of ichthyosis vulgaris.	general
Children with the inherited form of the disorder usually have normal skin at birth, but develop scaling and roughness during the first few years of life.	general
If genetic abnormalities aren't responsible for ichthyosis, it's referred to as acquired ichthyosis.	general
It's usually associated with other diseases, such as cancer, thyroid disease or HIV/AIDS.	general
Complications Some people with ichthyosis may experience: In rare cases, the skin thickness and scales of ichthyosis can interfere with sweating.	general
This can inhibit cooling.	general
In some people, excess sweating (hyperhidrosis) can occur.	general
Overheating.	general
Skin splitting and cracking may lead to infections.	general
Secondary infection.	general
Idiopathic hypersomnia is an uncommon sleep disorder that causes you to be excessively sleepy during the day even after a good night's sleep.	general
It also often causes difficulty waking up after you've been asleep at night or for a nap.	general
Naps generally aren't refreshing.	general
The need to sleep can strike at any time, including when you're driving a car or working, which makes idiopathic hypersomnia potentially dangerous.	general
The condition often develops over weeks to months.	general
Diagnosing idiopathic hypersomnia requires ruling out more common sleep disorders.	general
Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms with medication.	general
Pseudotumor cerebri (SOO-doe-too-mur SER-uh-bry) occurs when the pressure inside your skull (intracranial pressure) increases for no obvious reason.	general
It's also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension.	general
Symptoms mimic those of a brain tumor.	general
The increased intracranial pressure can cause swelling of the optic nerve and result in vision loss.	general
Medications often can reduce this pressure and the headache, but in some cases, surgery is necessary.	general
Pseudotumor cerebri can occur in children and adults, but it's most common in women of childbearing age who are obese.	general
Often severe headaches that might originate behind your eyes A whooshing sound in your head that pulses with your heartbeat Nausea, vomiting or dizziness Vision loss Brief episodes of blindness, lasting a few seconds and affecting one or both eyes Difficulty seeing to the side Double vision Neck, shoulder or back pain Sometimes, symptoms that have resolved can recur months or years later.	general
The cause of pseudotumor cerebri is unknown.	general
If a cause is determined, the condition is called secondary intracranial hypertension, rather than idiopathic.	general
Your brain and spinal cord are surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions these vital tissues from injury.	general
This fluid is produced in the brain and eventually is absorbed into the bloodstream at a rate that usually allows the pressure in your brain to remain constant.	general
The increased intracranial pressure of pseudotumor cerebri might result from a problem in this absorption process.	general
Risk factors Obese women of childbearing age are more likely to develop the disorder.	general
Medications Growth hormone Conditions and diseases that have been linked to secondary intracranial hypertension include: Addison's disease Complications For some people with pseudotumor cerebri, their vision continues to worsen, leading to blindness.	general
Walking on the toes or the balls of the feet, also known as toe walking, is fairly common in children who are just beginning to walk.	general
Most children outgrow it.	general
Kids who continue toe walking beyond the toddler years often do so out of habit.	general
As long as your child is growing and developing normally, toe walking is unlikely to be a cause for concern.	general
Toe walking sometimes can result from certain conditions, including cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and autism spectrum disorder.	general
Toe walking is walking on the toes or the ball of the foot.	general
When to see a doctor If your child is still toe walking after age 2, talk to your doctor about it.	general
Make an appointment sooner if your child also has tight leg muscles, stiffness in the Achilles tendon or a lack of muscle coordination.	general
Typically, toe walking is a habit that develops when a child learns to walk.	general
In a few cases, toe walking is caused by an underlying condition, such as: This tendon links the lower leg muscles to the back of the heel bone.	general
If it's too short, it can prevent the heel from touching the ground.	general
A short Achilles tendon.	general
Toe walking can be caused by a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture caused by injury or abnormal development in the parts of the immature brain that control muscle function.	general
Cerebral palsy.	general
Toe walking sometimes occurs in this genetic disease in which muscle fibers are unusually prone to damage and weaken over time.	general
This diagnosis might be more likely if your child initially walked normally before starting to toe walk.	general
Muscular dystrophy.	general
Toe walking has been linked to autism spectrum disorders, which affect a child's ability to communicate and interact with others.	general
Risk factors Toe walking out of habit, also known as idiopathic toe walking, sometimes runs in families.	general
Complications Persistent toe walking can increase a child's risk of falling.	general
It can also result in a social stigma.	general
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a disorder that can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding.	general
The bleeding results from unusually low levels of platelets ‚Äî the cells that help blood clot.	general
Formerly known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, can cause purple bruises, as well as tiny reddish-purple dots that look like a rash.	general
Children may develop after a viral infection and usually recover fully without treatment.	general
In adults, the disorder is often long term.	general
If you don't have signs of bleeding and your platelet count isn't too low, you may not need any treatment.	general
If your symptoms are more severe, treatment may include medications to boost your platelet count or surgery to remove your spleen.	general
Petechiae may look like a rash and usually appear in clusters.	general
Here they appear on a leg (A) and on an abdomen (B).	general
Immune thrombocytopenia may have no signs and symptoms.	general
When they do occur, they may include: Easy or excessive bruising Superficial bleeding into the skin that appears as pinpoint-sized reddish-purple spots (petechiae) that look like a rash, usually on the lower legs Bleeding from the gums or nose Blood in urine or stools Unusually heavy menstrual flow When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you or your child develops warning signs that worry you.	general
Bleeding that won't stop is a medical emergency.	general
Seek immediate help if you or your child experiences bleeding that can't be controlled by the usual first-aid techniques, such as applying pressure to the area.	general
More Information Immune thrombocytopenia usually happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets, which are cell fragments that help blood clot.	general
In adults, this may be triggered by infection with , hepatitis or H. pylori ‚Äî the type of bacteria that causes stomach ulcers.	general
In most children with , the disorder follows a viral illness, such as the mumps or the flu.	general
Risk factors is more common among young women.	general
The risk appears to be higher in people who also have diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome.	general
Complications A rare complication of immune thrombocytopenia is bleeding into the brain, which can be fatal.	general
If you're pregnant and your platelet count is very low or you have bleeding, you have a greater risk of heavy bleeding during delivery.	general
Your doctor may suggest treatment to maintain a stable platelet count, taking into account the effects on your baby.	general
Impacted wisdom teeth Impacted wisdom teeth Wisdom teeth are the last of your teeth to appear (erupt) in the mouth.	general
Sometimes a wisdom tooth becomes stuck below the surface of your gums (impacted), and grows at an odd angle, possibly causing complications.	general
Impacted wisdom teeth are third molars at the back of the mouth that don't have enough room to emerge or develop normally.	general
Wisdom teeth are the last adult teeth to come into the mouth (erupt).	general
Most people have four wisdom teeth at the back of the mouth ‚Äî two on the top, two on the bottom.	general
Impacted wisdom teeth can result in pain, damage to other teeth and other dental problems.	general
In some cases, impacted wisdom teeth may cause no apparent or immediate problems.	general
But because they're hard to clean, they may be more vulnerable to tooth decay and gum disease than other teeth are.	general
Impacted wisdom teeth that cause pain or other dental complications are usually removed.	general
Some dentists and oral surgeons also recommend removing impacted wisdom teeth that don't cause symptoms to prevent future problems.	general
Impacted wisdom teeth don't always cause symptoms.	general
However, when an impacted wisdom tooth becomes infected, damages other teeth or causes other dental problems, you may experience some of these signs or symptoms: Red or swollen gums Tender or bleeding gums Difficulty opening your mouth When to see a doctor See your dentist if you experience symptoms in the area behind your last molar that may be associated with an impacted wisdom tooth.	general
Wisdom teeth (third molars) become impacted because they don't have enough room to come in (erupt) or develop normally.	general
Wisdom teeth usually emerge sometime between the ages of 17 and 25.	general
Some people have wisdom teeth that emerge without any problems and line up with the other teeth behind the second molars.	general
In many cases, however, the mouth is too crowded for third molars to develop normally.	general
These crowded third molars become trapped (impacted).	general
An impacted wisdom tooth may partially emerge so that some of the crown is visible (partially impacted), or it may never break through the gums (fully impacted).	general
"Whether partially or fully impacted, the tooth may: Grow at an angle toward the next tooth (second molar) Grow at an angle toward the back of the mouth Grow at a right angle to the other teeth, as if the wisdom tooth is ""lying down"" within the jawbone Grow straight up or down like other teeth but stay trapped within the jawbone Complications Impacted wisdom teeth can cause several problems in the mouth: If the wisdom tooth pushes against the second molar, it may damage the second molar or increase the risk of infection in that area."	general
This pressure can also cause problems with crowding of the other teeth or require orthodontic treatment to straighten other teeth.	general
Damage to other teeth.	general
The wisdom tooth develops in a sac within the jawbone.	general
The sac can fill with fluid, forming a cyst that can damage the jawbone, teeth and nerves.	general
Rarely, a tumor ‚Äî usually noncancerous (benign) ‚Äî develops.	general
This complication may require removal of tissue and bone.	general
Partially impacted wisdom teeth appear to be at higher risk of tooth decay (caries) than other teeth.	general
This probably occurs because wisdom teeth are harder to clean and because food and bacteria get easily trapped between the gum and a partially erupted tooth.	general
The difficulty cleaning impacted, partially erupted wisdom teeth increases the risk of developing a painful, inflammatory gum condition called pericoronitis (per-ih-kor-o-NI-tis) in that area.	general
Gum disease.	general
You can't keep an impaction from occurring, but keeping regular six-month dental appointments for cleaning and checkups enables your dentist to monitor the growth and emergence of your wisdom teeth.	general
Regularly updated dental X-rays may indicate impacted wisdom teeth before any symptoms develop.	general
Impetigo starts as a red sore that ruptures, oozes for a few days and then forms a honey-colored crust.	general
Sores mainly occur around the nose and mouth in infants and children.	general
Impetigo (im-puh-TIE-go) is a common and highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects infants and children.	general
Impetigo usually appears as red sores on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth, and on hands and feet.	general
The sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts.	general
Treatment with antibiotics is generally recommended to help prevent the spread of impetigo to others.	general
It's important to keep your child home from school or day care until he or she is no longer contagious ‚Äî usually 24 hours after you begin antibiotic treatment.	general
Bullous impetigo Bullous impetigo Bullous impetigo causes fluid-filled blisters ‚Äî often on the trunk, arms and legs of infants and children younger than 2 years.	general
A more serious form of impetigo, called ecthyma, penetrates deeper into the skin ‚Äî causing painful fluid- or pus-filled sores that turn into deep ulcers.	general
Classic signs and symptoms of impetigo involve red sores that quickly rupture, ooze for a few days and then form a yellowish-brown crust.	general
The sores usually occur around the nose and mouth but can be spread to other areas of the body by fingers, clothing and towels.	general
Itching and soreness are generally mild.	general
A less common form of the disorder, called bullous impetigo, may feature larger blisters that occur on the trunk of infants and young children.	general
A more serious form of impetigo, called ecthyma, penetrates deeper into the skin ‚Äî causing painful fluid- or pus-filled sores that turn into deep ulcers.	general
When to see a doctor If you suspect that you or your child has impetigo, consult your family doctor, your child's pediatrician or a dermatologist.	general
You're exposed to the bacteria that cause impetigo when you come into contact with the sores of someone who's infected or with items they've touched ‚Äî such as clothing, bed linen, towels and even toys.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of impetigo include: Impetigo most commonly occurs in children ages 2 to 5.	general
Impetigo spreads easily in schools and child care settings.	general
Crowded conditions.	general
Impetigo infections are more common in summer.	general
Warm, humid weather.	general
Participation in sports that involve skin-to-skin contact, such as football or wrestling, increases your risk of developing impetigo.	general
Certain sports.	general
The bacteria that cause impetigo often enter your skin through a small skin injury, insect bite or rash.	general
Broken skin.	general
Adults and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system are more likely to develop ecthyma.	general
Complications Impetigo typically isn't dangerous.	general
And the sores in mild forms of the infection generally heal without scarring.	general
Rarely, complications of impetigo include: This potentially serious infection affects the tissues underlying your skin and eventually may spread to your lymph nodes and bloodstream.	general
Untreated cellulitis can quickly become life-threatening.	general
Cellulitis.	general
One of the types of bacteria that cause impetigo can also damage your kidneys.	general
Kidney problems.	general
The ulcers associated with ecthyma can leave scars.	general
Keeping skin clean is the best way to keep it healthy.	general
It's important to wash cuts, scrapes, insect bites and other wounds right away.	general
To help prevent impetigo from spreading to others: Gently wash the affected areas with mild soap and running water and then cover lightly with gauze.	general
Wash an infected person's clothes, linens and towels every day and don't share them with anyone else in your family.	general
Wear gloves when applying antibiotic ointment and wash your hands thoroughly afterward.	general
Cut an infected child's nails short to prevent damage from scratching.	general
Wash hands frequently.	general
Keep your child home until your doctor says he or she isn't contagious.	general
Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.	general
An incompetent cervix, also called a cervical insufficiency, occurs when weak cervical tissue causes or contributes to premature birth or the loss of an otherwise healthy pregnancy.	general
Before pregnancy, your cervix ‚Äî the lower part of the uterus that opens to the vagina ‚Äî is normally closed and firm.	general
As pregnancy progresses and you prepare to give birth, the cervix gradually softens, decreases in length (effaces) and opens (dilates).	general
If you have an incompetent cervix, your cervix might begin to open too soon ‚Äî causing you to give birth too early.	general
An incompetent cervix can be difficult to diagnose and treat.	general
If your cervix begins to open early, or you have a history of cervical insufficiency, your doctor might recommend preventive medication during pregnancy, frequent ultrasounds or a procedure that closes the cervix with strong sutures (cervical cerclage).	general
If you have an incompetent cervix, you may not have any signs or symptoms during early pregnancy.	general
Some women have mild discomfort or spotting over the course of several days or weeks starting between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy.	general
Be on the lookout for: A sensation of pelvic pressure A new backache Mild abdominal cramps Light vaginal bleeding Risk factors Many women don't have a known risk factor.	general
Risk factors for cervical insufficiency include: Some surgical procedures used to treat cervical abnormalities associated with an abnormal Pap smear can result in cervical insufficiency.	general
Other surgical procedures such as a D&C could also be associated with cervical insufficiency.	general
Rarely, a cervical tear during a previous labor and delivery could be associated with an incompetent cervix.	general
Cervical trauma.	general
Black women seem to have a higher risk of developing cervical insufficiency.	general
It isn't clear why.	general
Uterine abnormalities and genetic disorders affecting a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body's connective tissues (collagen) might cause an incompetent cervix.	general
Exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic form of the hormone estrogen, before birth also has been linked to cervical insufficiency.	general
Congenital conditions.	general
Complications An incompetent cervix poses risks for your pregnancy ‚Äî particularly during the second trimester ‚Äî including: Premature birth Pregnancy loss You can't prevent an incompetent cervix ‚Äî but there's much you can do to promote a healthy, full-term pregnancy.	general
For example: Prenatal visits can help your doctor monitor your health and your baby's health.	general
Mention any signs or symptoms that concern you, even if they seem silly or unimportant.	general
Seek regular prenatal care.	general
During pregnancy, you'll need more folic acid, calcium, iron and other essential nutrients.	general
A daily prenatal vitamin ‚Äî ideally starting a few months before conception ‚Äî can help fill any dietary gaps.	general
Eat a healthy diet.	general
Gaining the right amount of weight can support your baby's health.	general
A weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds (about 11 to 16 kilograms) is often recommended for women who have a healthy weight before pregnancy.	general
Gain weight wisely.	general
If you smoke, quit.	general
Alcohol and illegal drugs are off-limits, too.	general
In addition, get your doctor's OK before taking any medications or supplements ‚Äî even those available over-the-counter.	general
Avoid risky substances.	general
If you've had an incompetent cervix during one pregnacy, you're at risk of premature birth or pregnancy loss in later pregnancies.	general
If you're considering getting pregnant again, talk with your doctor to understand the risks and what you can do to promote a healthy pregnancy.	general
Infant jaundice is yellow discoloration of a newborn baby's skin and eyes.	general
Infant jaundice occurs because the baby's blood contains an excess of bilirubin (bil-ih-ROO-bin), a yellow pigment of red blood cells.	general
Infant jaundice is a common condition, particularly in babies born before 38 weeks' gestation (preterm babies) and some breast-fed babies.	general
Infant jaundice usually occurs because a baby's liver isn't mature enough to get rid of bilirubin in the bloodstream.	general
In some babies, an underlying disease may cause infant jaundice.	general
Most infants born between 35 weeks' gestation and full term need no treatment for jaundice.	general
Rarely, an unusually high blood level of bilirubin can place a newborn at risk of brain damage, particularly in the presence of certain risk factors for severe jaundice.	general
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes ‚Äî the main sign of infant jaundice ‚Äî usually appears between the second and fourth day after birth.	general
To check for infant jaundice, press gently on your baby's forehead or nose.	general
If the skin looks yellow where you pressed, it's likely your baby has mild jaundice.	general
If your baby doesn't have jaundice, the skin color should simply look slightly lighter than its normal color for a moment.	general
Examine your baby in good lighting conditions, preferably in natural daylight.	general
When to see a doctor Most hospitals have a policy of examining babies for jaundice before discharge.	general
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that newborns be examined for jaundice during routine medical checks and at least every eight to 12 hours while in the hospital.	general
Your baby should be examined for jaundice between the third and seventh day after birth, when bilirubin levels usually peak.	general
If your baby is discharged earlier than 72 hours after birth, make a follow-up appointment to look for jaundice within two days of discharge.	general
The following signs or symptoms may indicate severe jaundice or complications from excess bilirubin.	general
Call your doctor if: Your baby's skin becomes more yellow The skin on your baby's the abdomen, arms or legs looks yellow The whites of your baby's eyes look yellow Your baby seems listless or sick or is difficult to awaken Your baby isn't gaining weight or is feeding poorly Your baby makes high-pitched cries Your baby develops any other signs or symptoms that concern you Excess bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia) is the main cause of jaundice.	general
"Bilirubin, which is responsible for the yellow color of jaundice, is a normal part of the pigment released from the breakdown of ""used"" red blood cells."	general
Newborns produce more bilirubin than adults do because of greater production and faster breakdown of red blood cells in the first few days of life.	general
Normally, the liver filters bilirubin from the bloodstream and releases it into the intestinal tract.	general
A newborn's immature liver often can't remove bilirubin quickly enough, causing an excess of bilirubin.	general
Jaundice due to these normal newborn conditions is called physiologic jaundice, and it typically appears on the second or third day of life.	general
Other causes An underlying disorder may cause infant jaundice.	general
In these cases, jaundice often appears much earlier or much later than does the more common form of infant jaundice.	general
Diseases or conditions that can cause jaundice include: Internal bleeding (hemorrhage) Other viral or bacterial infections An incompatibility between the mother's blood and the baby's blood A liver malfunction An enzyme deficiency An abnormality of your baby's red blood cells that causes them to break down rapidly Risk factors Major risk factors for jaundice, particularly severe jaundice that can cause complications, include: A baby born before 38 weeks of gestation may not be able to process bilirubin as quickly as full-term babies do.	general
Premature babies also may feed less and have fewer bowel movements, resulting in less bilirubin eliminated through stool.	general
Premature birth.	general
Newborns who become bruised during delivery gets bruises from the delivery may have higher levels of bilirubin from the breakdown of more red blood cells.	general
Significant bruising during birth.	general
If the mother's blood type is different from her baby's, the baby may have received antibodies through the placenta that cause abnormally rapid breakdown of red blood cells.	general
Blood type.	general
Breast-fed babies, particularly those who have difficulty nursing or getting enough nutrition from breast-feeding, are at higher risk of jaundice.	general
Dehydration or a low caloric intake may contribute to the onset of jaundice.	general
However, because of the benefits of breast-feeding, experts still recommend it.	general
It's important to make sure your baby gets enough to eat and is adequately hydrated.	general
Breast-feeding.	general
Complications High levels of bilirubin that cause severe jaundice can result in serious complications if not treated.	general
Acute bilirubin encephalopathy Bilirubin is toxic to cells of the brain.	general
If a baby has severe jaundice, there's a risk of bilirubin passing into the brain, a condition called acute bilirubin encephalopathy.	general
Prompt treatment may prevent significant lasting damage.	general
Signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy in a baby with jaundice include: Listlessness Kernicterus Kernicterus is the syndrome that occurs if acute bilirubin encephalopathy causes permanent damage to the brain.	general
Kernicterus may result in: Involuntary and uncontrolled movements (athetoid cerebral palsy) Permanent upward gaze The best preventive of infant jaundice is adequate feeding.	general
Breast-fed infants should have eight to 12 feedings a day for the first several days of life.	general
Formula-fed infants usually should have 1 to 2 ounces (about 30 to 60 milliliters) of formula every two to three hours for the first week.	general
Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms ‚Äî such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites.	general
Many organisms live in and on our bodies.	general
They're normally harmless or even helpful.	general
But under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease.	general
Some infectious diseases can be passed from person to person.	general
Some are transmitted by insects or other animals.	general
And you may get others by consuming contaminated food or water or being exposed to organisms in the environment.	general
Signs and symptoms vary depending on the organism causing the infection, but often include fever and fatigue.	general
Mild infections may respond to rest and home remedies, while some life-threatening infections may need hospitalization.	general
Many infectious diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, can be prevented by vaccines.	general
Frequent and thorough hand-washing also helps protect you from most infectious diseases.	general
Each infectious disease has its own specific signs and symptoms.	general
General signs and symptoms common to a number of infectious diseases include: Have been bitten by an animal Are having trouble breathing Have severe headache with fever Experience a rash or swelling Have unexplained or prolonged fever Have sudden vision problems Infectious diseases can be caused by: These one-cell organisms are responsible for illnesses such as strep throat, urinary tract infections and tuberculosis.	general
Even smaller than bacteria, viruses cause a multitude of diseases ranging from the common cold to AIDS.	general
Many skin diseases, such as ringworm and athlete's foot, are caused by fungi.	general
Other types of fungi can infect your lungs or nervous system.	general
Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite that is transmitted by a mosquito bite.	general
Other parasites may be transmitted to humans from animal feces.	general
Direct contact An easy way to catch most infectious diseases is by coming in contact with a person or an animal with the infection.	general
Infectious diseases can be spread through direct contact such as: Infectious diseases commonly spread through the direct transfer of bacteria, viruses or other germs from one person to another.	general
This can happen when an individual with the bacterium or virus touches, kisses, or coughs or sneezes on someone who isn't infected.	general
Person to person.	general
These germs can also spread through the exchange of body fluids from sexual contact.	general
The person who passes the germ may have no symptoms of the disease, but may simply be a carrier.	general
Being bitten or scratched by an infected animal ‚Äî even a pet ‚Äî can make you sick and, in extreme circumstances, can be fatal.	general
Handling animal waste can be hazardous, too.	general
For example, you can get a toxoplasmosis infection by scooping your cat's litter box.	general
Animal to person.	general
A pregnant woman may pass germs that cause infectious diseases to her unborn baby.	general
Some germs can pass through the placenta or through breast milk.	general
Germs in the vagina can also be transmitted to the baby during birth.	general
Mother to unborn child.	general
Indirect contact Disease-causing organisms also can be passed by indirect contact.	general
Many germs can linger on an inanimate object, such as a tabletop, doorknob or faucet handle.	general
When you touch a doorknob handled by someone ill with the flu or a cold, for example, you can pick up the germs he or she left behind.	general
If you then touch your eyes, mouth or nose before washing your hands, you may become infected.	general
Insect bites Some germs rely on insect carriers ‚Äî such as mosquitoes, fleas, lice or ticks ‚Äî to move from host to host.	general
These carriers are known as vectors.	general
Mosquitoes can carry the malaria parasite or West Nile virus.	general
Deer ticks may carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.	general
Food contamination Disease-causing germs can also infect you through contaminated food and water.	general
This mechanism of transmission allows germs to be spread to many people through a single source.	general
Escherichia coli (E.	general
coli), for example, is a bacterium present in or on certain foods ‚Äî such as undercooked hamburger or unpasteurized fruit juice.	general
More Information Risk factors While anyone can catch infectious diseases, you may be more likely to get sick if your immune system isn't working properly.	general
This may occur if: You're taking steroids or other medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs for a transplanted organ You have HIV or AIDS You have certain types of cancer or other disorders that affect your immune system In addition, certain other medical conditions may predispose you to infection, including implanted medical devices, malnutrition and extremes of age, among others.	general
Complications Most infectious diseases have only minor complications.	general
But some infections ‚Äî such as pneumonia, AIDS and meningitis ‚Äî can become life-threatening.	general
A few types of infections have been linked to a long-term increased risk of cancer: Human papillomavirus is linked to cervical cancer Helicobacter pylori is linked to stomach cancer and peptic ulcers Hepatitis B and C have been linked to liver cancer In addition, some infectious diseases may become silent, only to appear again in the future ‚Äî sometimes even decades later.	general
For example, someone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles much later in life.	general
Follow these tips to decrease the risk of infection: This is especially important before and after preparing food, before eating, and after using the toilet.	general
And try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands, as that's a common way germs enter the body.	general
Wash your hands.	general
Vaccination can drastically reduce your chances of contracting many diseases.	general
Make sure to keep up to date on your recommended vaccinations, as well as your children's.	general
Get vaccinated.	general
Don't go to work if you are vomiting, have diarrhea or have a fever.	general
Don't send your child to school if he or she has these signs, either.	general
Stay home when ill.	general
Keep counters and other kitchen surfaces clean when preparing meals.	general
Cook foods to the proper temperature, using a food thermometer to check for doneness.	general
For ground meats, that means at least 160 F (71 C); for poultry, 165 F (74 C); and for most other meats, at least 145 F (63 C).	general
Prepare food safely.	general
Also promptly refrigerate leftovers ‚Äî don't let cooked foods remain at room temperature for long periods of time.	general
Always use condoms if you or your partner has a history of sexually transmitted infections or high-risk behavior.	general
Practice safe sex.	general
Use your own toothbrush, comb and razor.	general
Avoid sharing drinking glasses or dining utensils.	general
Don't share personal items.	general
If you're traveling out of the country, talk to your doctor about any special vaccinations ‚Äî such as yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A or B, or typhoid fever ‚Äî you may need.	general
Travel wisely.	general
If you and your partner are struggling to have a baby, you're not alone.	general
In the United States, 10% to 15% of couples are infertile.	general
Infertility is defined as not being able to get pregnant despite having frequent, unprotected sex for at least a year for most couples.	general
Infertility may result from an issue with either you or your partner, or a combination of factors that prevent pregnancy.	general
Fortunately, there are many safe and effective therapies that significantly improve your chances of getting pregnant.	general
Products & Services The main symptom of infertility is not getting pregnant.	general
There may be no other obvious symptoms.	general
Sometimes, a woman with infertility may have irregular or absent menstrual periods.	general
In some cases, a man with infertility may have some signs of hormonal problems, such as changes in hair growth or sexual function.	general
Most couples will eventually conceive, with or without treatment.	general
When to see a doctor You probably don't need to see a doctor about infertility unless you have been trying regularly to get pregnant for at least one year.	general
Women should talk with a doctor earlier, however, if they: Are age 35 or older and have been trying to conceive for six months or longer Are over age 40 Have very painful periods Have known fertility problems Have had multiple miscarriages Men should talk to a doctor if they have: A low sperm count or other problems with sperm A history of testicular, prostate or sexual problems Undergone treatment for cancer Fertilization and implantation Fertilization and implantation During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote.	general
Then the zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula.	general
Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst.	general
The blastocyst then burrows into the uterine wall ‚Äî a process called implantation.	general
Male reproductive system Male reproductive system The male reproductive system makes, stores and moves sperm.	general
The testicles produce sperm.	general
Fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland combines with sperm to make semen.	general
The penis ejaculates semen during sexual intercourse.	general
Female reproductive system Female reproductive system The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system.	general
All of the steps during ovulation and fertilization need to happen correctly in order to get pregnant.	general
Sometimes the issues that cause infertility in couples are present at birth, and sometimes they develop later in life.	general
Infertility causes can affect one or both partners.	general
In general: In about one-third of cases, there is an issue with the man In about one-third of cases, there is an issue with the woman In the remaining cases, there are issues with both the man and the woman, or no cause can be found Causes of male infertility These may include: due to undescended testicles, genetic defects, health problems such as diabetes, or infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, mumps or HIV.	general
Enlarged veins in the testes (varicocele) also can affect the quality of sperm.	general
Abnormal sperm production or function due to sexual problems, such as premature ejaculation; certain genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis; structural problems, such as a blockage in the testicle; or damage or injury to the reproductive organs.	general
Problems with the delivery of sperm such as pesticides and other chemicals, and radiation.	general
Cigarette smoking, alcohol, marijuana, anabolic steroids, and taking medications to treat bacterial infections, high blood pressure and depression also can affect fertility.	general
Frequent exposure to heat, such as in saunas or hot tubs, can raise body temperature and may affect sperm production.	general
Overexposure to certain environmental factors, including radiation or chemotherapy.	general
Treatment for cancer can impair sperm production, sometimes severely.	general
Damage related to cancer and its treatment, Causes of female infertility Causes of female infertility may include: which affect the release of eggs from the ovaries.	general
These include hormonal disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome.	general
Hyperprolactinemia, a condition in which you have too much prolactin ‚Äî the hormone that stimulates breast milk production ‚Äî also may interfere with ovulation.	general
Either too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism) can affect the menstrual cycle or cause infertility.	general
Other underlying causes may include too much exercise, eating disorders or tumors.	general
Ovulation disorders, including abnormalities with the cervix, polyps in the uterus or the shape of the uterus.	general
Noncancerous (benign) tumors in the uterine wall (uterine fibroids) may cause infertility by blocking the fallopian tubes or stopping a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus.	general
Uterine or cervical abnormalities, often caused by inflammation of the fallopian tube (salpingitis).	general
This can result from pelvic inflammatory disease, which is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection, endometriosis or adhesions.	general
Fallopian tube damage or blockage, which occurs when endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus, may affect the function of the ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes.	general
Endometriosis, when the ovaries stop working and menstruation ends before age 40.	general
Although the cause is often unknown, certain factors are associated with early menopause, including immune system diseases, certain genetic conditions such as Turner syndrome or carriers of Fragile X syndrome, and radiation or chemotherapy treatment.	general
Primary ovarian insufficiency (early menopause), bands of scar tissue that bind organs that can form after pelvic infection, appendicitis, endometriosis or abdominal or pelvic surgery.	general
Pelvic adhesions, Certain cancers ‚Äî particularly reproductive cancers ‚Äî often impair female fertility.	general
Both radiation and chemotherapy may affect fertility.	general
Cancer and its treatment.	general
More Information Risk factors Many of the risk factors for both male and female infertility are the same.	general
They include: Women's fertility gradually declines with age, especially in the mid-30s, and it drops rapidly after age 37.	general
Infertility in older women is likely due to the lower number and quality of eggs, and can also be due to health problems that affect fertility.	general
Men over age 40 may be less fertile than younger men.	general
Smoking tobacco or marijuana by either partner may reduce the likelihood of pregnancy.	general
Smoking also reduces the possible effectiveness of fertility treatment.	general
Miscarriages are more frequent in women who smoke.	general
Smoking can increase the risk of erectile dysfunction and a low sperm count in men.	general
Tobacco use.	general
For women, there's no safe level of alcohol use during conception or pregnancy.	general
Alcohol use may contribute to infertility.	general
For men, heavy alcohol use can decrease sperm count and motility.	general
Alcohol use.	general
Among American women, an inactive lifestyle and being overweight may increase the risk of infertility.	general
For men, sperm count also may be affected by being overweight.	general
Being overweight.	general
Women at risk of fertility problems include those with eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia, and those who follow a very low-calorie or restrictive diet.	general
Being underweight.	general
A lack of exercise contributes to obesity, which increases the risk of infertility.	general
Less often, ovulation problems may be associated with frequent strenuous, intense exercise in women who are not overweight.	general
Exercise issues.	general
Some types of infertility aren't preventable.	general
But several strategies may increase your chances of pregnancy.	general
Have regular intercourse several times around the time of ovulation for the highest pregnancy rate.	general
Intercourse beginning at least five days before and until a day after ovulation improves your chances of getting pregnant.	general
Ovulation usually occurs in the middle of the cycle ‚Äî halfway between menstrual periods ‚Äî for most women with menstrual cycles about 28 days apart.	general
Although most types of infertility aren't preventable in men, these strategies may help: which may contribute to male infertility.	general
Avoid drug and tobacco use and drinking too much alcohol, as they can temporarily affect sperm production and motility.	general
Avoid high temperatures found in hot tubs and hot baths, which can affect sperm production.	general
Avoid exposure to industrial or environmental toxins, both prescription and nonprescription drugs.	general
Talk with your doctor about any medications you take regularly, but don't stop taking prescription medications without medical advice.	general
Limit medications that may impact fertility, Regular exercise may improve sperm quality and increase the chances for achieving a pregnancy.	general
Exercise moderately.	general
For women, a number of strategies may increase the chances of becoming pregnant: Tobacco has many negative effects on fertility, not to mention your general health and the health of a fetus.	general
If you smoke and are considering pregnancy, quit now.	general
Quit smoking.	general
These substances may impair your ability to conceive and have a healthy pregnancy.	general
Don't drink alcohol or use recreational drugs, such as marijuana, if you're trying to get pregnant.	general
Avoid alcohol and street drugs.	general
Women trying to get pregnant may want to limit caffeine intake.	general
Ask your doctor for guidance on the safe use of caffeine.	general
Limit caffeine.	general
Regular exercise is important, but exercising so intensely that your periods are infrequent or absent can affect fertility.	general
Exercise moderately.	general
Being overweight or underweight can affect your hormone production and cause infertility.	general
Avoid weight extremes.	general
Up to 15 percent of couples are infertile.	general
This means they aren't able to conceive a child, even though they've had frequent, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year or longer.	general
In over a third of these couples, male infertility plays a role.	general
Male infertility is due to low sperm production, abnormal sperm function or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm.	general
Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices and other factors can play a role in causing male infertility.	general
Not being able to conceive a child can be stressful and frustrating, but a number of male infertility treatments are available.	general
Products & Services The main sign of male infertility is the inability to conceive a child.	general
There may be no other obvious signs or symptoms.	general
In some cases, however, an underlying problem such as an inherited disorder, a hormonal imbalance, dilated veins around the testicle or a condition that blocks the passage of sperm causes signs and symptoms.	general
Although most men with male infertility do not notice symptoms other than the inability to conceive a child, signs and symptoms associated with male infertility include: Problems with sexual function ‚Äî for example, difficulty with ejaculation or small volumes of fluid ejaculated, reduced sexual desire, or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area Recurrent respiratory infections Inability to smell Abnormal breast growth (gynecomastia) Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosomal or hormonal abnormality A lower than normal sperm count (fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or a total sperm count of less than 39 million per ejaculate) When to see a doctor See a doctor if you have been unable to conceive a child after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse or sooner if you have any of the following: Erection or ejaculation problems, low sex drive, or other problems with sexual function Pain, discomfort, a lump or swelling in the testicle area A history of testicle, prostate or sexual problems A groin, testicle, penis or scrotum surgery Male fertility is a complex process.	general
To get your partner pregnant, the following must occur: Initially, this involves the growth and formation of the male reproductive organs during puberty.	general
At least one of your testicles must be functioning correctly, and your body must produce testosterone and other hormones to trigger and maintain sperm production.	general
You must produce healthy sperm.	general
Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis.	general
Sperm have to be carried into the semen.	general
If the number of sperm in your semen (sperm count) is low, it decreases the odds that one of your sperm will fertilize your partner's egg.	general
A low sperm count is fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or fewer than 39 million per ejaculate.	general
There needs to be enough sperm in the semen.	general
If the movement (motility) or function of your sperm is abnormal, the sperm may not be able to reach or penetrate your partner's egg.	general
Sperm must be functional and able to move.	general
Medical causes Problems with male fertility can be caused by a number of health issues and medical treatments.	general
Some of these include: A varicocele is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle.	general
It's the most common reversible cause of male infertility.	general
Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it may be related to abnormal testicular temperature regulation.	general
Varicoceles result in reduced quality of the sperm.	general
Varicocele.	general
Treating the varicocele can improve sperm numbers and function, and may potentially improve outcomes when using assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization.	general
Some infections can interfere with sperm production or sperm health or can cause scarring that blocks the passage of sperm.	general
These include inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) or testicles (orchitis) and some sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea or HIV.	general
Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved.	general
Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm instead of emerging out the tip of the penis.	general
Various health conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation, including diabetes, spinal injuries, medications, and surgery of the bladder, prostate or urethra.	general
Ejaculation issues.	general
Some men with spinal cord injuries or certain diseases can't ejaculate semen, even though they still produce sperm.	general
Often in these cases sperm can still be retrieved for use in assisted reproductive techniques.	general
Anti-sperm antibodies are immune system cells that mistakenly identify sperm as harmful invaders and attempt to eliminate them.	general
Antibodies that attack sperm.	general
Cancers and nonmalignant tumors can affect the male reproductive organs directly, through the glands that release hormones related to reproduction, such as the pituitary gland, or through unknown causes.	general
In some cases, surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors can affect male fertility.	general
In some males, during fetal development one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the sac that normally contains the testicles (scrotum).	general
Decreased fertility is more likely in men who have had this condition.	general
Undescended testicles.	general
Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves or an abnormality affecting other hormonal systems including the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands.	general
Low testosterone (male hypogonadism) and other hormonal problems have a number of possible underlying causes.	general
Hormone imbalances.	general
Many different tubes carry sperm.	general
They can be blocked due to various causes, including inadvertent injury from surgery, prior infections, trauma or abnormal development, such as with cystic fibrosis or similar inherited conditions.	general
Defects of tubules that transport sperm.	general
Blockage can occur at any level, including within the testicle, in the tubes that drain the testicle, in the epididymis, in the vas deferens, near the ejaculatory ducts or in the urethra.	general
Inherited disorders such as Klinefelter's syndrome ‚Äî in which a male is born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (instead of one X and one Y) ‚Äî cause abnormal development of the male reproductive organs.	general
Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis, Kallmann's syndrome and Kartagener's syndrome.	general
Chromosome defects.	general
These can include trouble keeping or maintaining an erection sufficient for sex (erectile dysfunction), premature ejaculation, painful intercourse, anatomical abnormalities such as having a urethral opening beneath the penis (hypospadias), or psychological or relationship problems that interfere with sex.	general
Problems with sexual intercourse.	general
A digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, celiac disease can cause male infertility.	general
Fertility may improve after adopting a gluten-free diet.	general
Celiac disease.	general
Testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), certain antifungal medications, some ulcer drugs and certain other medications can impair sperm production and decrease male fertility.	general
Certain medications.	general
Certain surgeries may prevent you from having sperm in your ejaculate, including vasectomy, inguinal hernia repairs, scrotal or testicular surgeries, prostate surgeries, and large abdominal surgeries performed for testicular and rectal cancers, among others.	general
In most cases, surgery can be performed to either reverse these blockage or to retrieve sperm directly from the epididymis and testicles.	general
Prior surgeries.	general
Environmental causes Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm production or sperm function.	general
Specific causes include: Extended exposure to benzenes, toluene, xylene, pesticides, herbicides, organic solvents, painting materials and lead may contribute to low sperm counts.	general
Industrial chemicals.	general
Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also may cause infertility.	general
Heavy metal exposure.	general
Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production, though it will often eventually return to normal.	general
With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced.	general
Radiation or X-rays.	general
Elevated temperatures impair sperm production and function.	general
Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs may temporarily impair your sperm count.	general
Overheating the testicles.	general
Sitting for long periods, wearing tight clothing or working on a laptop computer for long stretches of time also may increase the temperature in your scrotum and may slightly reduce sperm production.	general
Health, lifestyle and other causes Some other causes of male infertility include: Anabolic steroids taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease.	general
Use of cocaine or marijuana may temporarily reduce the number and quality of your sperm as well.	general
Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels, cause erectile dysfunction and decrease sperm production.	general
Liver disease caused by excessive drinking also may lead to fertility problems.	general
Alcohol use.	general
Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke.	general
Secondhand smoke also may affect male fertility.	general
Tobacco smoking.	general
Stress can interfere with certain hormones needed to produce sperm.	general
Severe or prolonged emotional stress, including problems with fertility, can affect your sperm count.	general
Emotional stress.	general
Research shows that the likelihood of pregnancy may be lower if a male partner has severe depression.	general
In addition, depression in men may cause sexual dysfunction due to reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, or delayed or inhibited ejaculation.	general
Depression.	general
Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm themselves as well as by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility.	general
Certain occupations including welding or those involving prolonged sitting, such as truck driving, may be associated with a risk of infertility.	general
However, the research to support these links is mixed.	general
More Information Smoking tobacco Using alcohol Having certain past or present infections Being exposed to toxins Having a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery Having a history of undescended testicles Being born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative with a fertility disorder Having certain medical conditions, including tumors and chronic illnesses, such as sickle cell disease Taking certain medications or undergoing medical treatments, such as surgery or radiation used for treating cancer Complications Infertility can be stressful for both you and your partner.	general
Complications of male infertility can include: Surgery or other procedures to treat an underlying cause of low sperm count or other reproductive problems Expensive and involved reproductive techniques Stress and relationship difficulties related to the inability to have a child Many types of male infertility aren't preventable.	general
However, you can avoid some known causes of male infertility.	general
For example: Don't smoke.	general
Keep the weight off.	general
Don't get a vasectomy.	general
Avoid things that lead to prolonged heat for the testicles.	general

An ingrown hair occurs when a shaved or tweezed hair grows back into the skin.	general
It can cause inflammation, pain and tiny bumps in the area where the hair was removed.	general
Ingrown hair is a common condition that results from hair removal.	general
It's most prevalent in black men who shave facial hair.	general
But ingrown hair can affect anyone who removes hair by shaving, tweezing or waxing.	general
Often, an ingrown hair improves without treatment.	general
You can avoid ingrown hair by not removing hair.	general
If that's not an option, you can use hair removal methods that lessen the risk of developing ingrown hairs.	general
Ingrown hairs most commonly appear in the beard area, including the chin and cheeks and, especially, the neck.	general
They can appear on the scalp in those who shave their heads.	general
Other common areas for ingrown hairs are the armpits, pubic area and legs.	general
Signs and symptoms include: Skin darkening (hyperpigmentation) When to see a doctor An occasional ingrown hair isn't cause for alarm.	general
See your doctor if your ingrown hairs are a chronic condition.	general
Hair structure and direction of growth play a role in ingrown hairs.	general
A curved hair follicle, which produces tightly curled hair, is believed to encourage the hair to re-enter the skin once the hair is cut and starts to grow back.	general
Shaving creates sharp edges in this type of hair, especially if the hair is dry when shaved.	general
You might also get an ingrown hair if you: Pull your skin taut during shaving ‚Äî which allows the cut hair to draw back into the skin and re-enter the skin without first growing out Tweeze ‚Äî which also can leave a hair fragment under the skin surface When a hair penetrates your skin, your skin reacts as it would to a foreign body ‚Äî it becomes inflamed.	general
Risk factors Having tightly curled hair is the main risk factor for ingrown hairs.	general
Complications Razor bumps (pseudofolliculitis barbae) affects men with curly beards.	general
It develops when shaved hairs curve back into the skin, leading to inflammation.	general
Chronic ingrown hairs can lead to: Bacterial infection (from scratching) To help prevent ingrown hairs, avoid shaving, tweezing and waxing.	general
If that's not an option, use these tips to make ingrown hairs less likely: Wash your skin with warm water and a mild facial cleanser before shaving.	general
Apply lubricating shaving cream or gel a few minutes before shaving to soften the hair.	general
Or apply a warm compress.	general
Use a sharp razor every time you shave.	general
Further study is needed to determine whether a single- or multiple-blade razor is best for preventing ingrown hair.	general
See what works best for you.	general
Avoid close shaves.	general
Rinse the blade after each stroke.	general
Rinse your skin and apply lotion after you shave.	general
The following hair removal methods also may help prevent ingrown hairs: With the razor, avoid the closest shave setting and hold the razor or clipper slightly away from your skin.	general
Electric razor or clipper.	general
The chemicals in hair-removing products (depilatories) may irritate your skin, so test on a small area first.	general
Chemical hair remover.	general
A product called eflornithine (Vaniqa) is a prescription cream that decreases hair regrowth when combined with another hair removal method, such as laser therapy.	general
Further study is needed to prove the usefulness of this method.	general
A cream to decrease hair growth.	general
Ingrown toenail Ingrown toenail An ingrown toenail may cause pain, redness, swelling and, sometimes, an infection around the toenail.	general
Ingrown toenails are a common condition in which the corner or side of a toenail grows into the soft flesh.	general
The result is pain, redness, swelling and, sometimes, an infection.	general
Ingrown toenails usually affect your big toe.	general
Often you can take care of ingrown toenails on your own.	general
If the pain is severe or spreading, your doctor can take steps to relieve your discomfort and help you avoid complications of ingrown toenails.	general
If you have diabetes or another condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet, you're at greater risk of complications of ingrown toenails.	general
Ingrown toenail symptoms include: Pain and tenderness in your toe along one or both sides of the nail Redness around your toenail When to see a doctor See your doctor if you: Experience severe discomfort in your toe or pus or redness that seems to be spreading Have diabetes or another condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet and you experience any foot sore or infection Wearing shoes that crowd your toenails Cutting your toenails too short or not straight across Injuring your toenail Complications Left untreated or undetected, an ingrown toenail can infect the underlying bone and lead to a serious bone infection.	general
Complications can be especially severe if you have diabetes, which can cause poor blood flow and damage nerves in your feet.	general
So a minor foot injury ‚Äî a cut, scrape, corn, callus or ingrown toenail ‚Äî may not heal properly and become infected.	general
A difficult-to-heal open sore (foot ulcer) may require surgery to prevent the decay and death of tissue (gangrene).	general
Gangrene results from an interruption in blood flow to an area of your body.	general
To help prevent an ingrown toenail: Don't curve your nails to match the shape of the front of your toe.	general
If you have your toenails done at a salon, be sure to tell your pedicurist to trim your nails straight across.	general
If you have a condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet and you can't trim your nails, see a podiatrist regularly to have your nails trimmed.	general
Trim your toenails straight across.	general
Trim toenails so they're even with the tips of your toes.	general
If you trim your toenails too short, the pressure from your shoes on your toes may direct a nail to grow into the tissue.	general
Keep toenails at a moderate length.	general
Shoes that place too much pressure on your toes or pinch them may cause a nail to grow into surrounding tissue.	general
If you have nerve damage to your feet, you may not be able to sense if your shoes fit too tightly.	general
Take care to buy and wear properly fitted shoes, preferably from a shoe store specializing in fitting shoes for people with foot problems.	general
Wear shoes that fit properly.	general
If your work puts you at risk of injuring your toes, wear protective footwear, such as steel-toed shoes.	general
Wear protective footwear.	general
If you have diabetes, check your feet daily for signs of ingrown toenails or other foot problems.	general
Check your feet.	general
Inherited metabolic disorders refer to different types of medical conditions caused by genetic defects ‚Äî most commonly inherited from both parents ‚Äî that interfere with the body's metabolism.	general
These conditions may also be called inborn errors of metabolism.	general
Metabolism is the complex set of chemical reactions that your body uses to maintain life, including energy production.	general
Special enzymes break down food or certain chemicals so your body can use them right away for fuel or store them.	general
Also, certain chemical processes break down substances that your body no longer needs, or make those it lacks.	general
When these chemical processes don't work properly due to a hormone or enzyme deficiency, a metabolic disorder occurs.	general
Inherited metabolic disorders fall into different categories, depending on the specific substance and whether it builds up in harmful amounts (because it can't be broken down), it's too low or it's missing.	general
There are hundreds of inherited metabolic disorders, caused by different genetic defects.	general
Examples include: Treatment for an inherited metabolic disorder depends on the type and severity of the disorder.	general
Because there are so many types of inherited metabolic disorders, treatment recommendations may vary considerably ‚Äî from dietary restrictions to liver transplants.	general
Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep, or cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep.	general
You may still feel tired when you wake up.	general
Insomnia can sap not only your energy level and mood but also your health, work performance and quality of life.	general
How much sleep is enough varies from person to person, but most adults need seven to eight hours a night.	general
At some point, many adults experience short-term (acute) insomnia, which lasts for days or weeks.	general
It's usually the result of stress or a traumatic event.	general
But some people have long-term (chronic) insomnia that lasts for a month or more.	general
Insomnia may be the primary problem, or it may be associated with other medical conditions or medications.	general
You don't have to put up with sleepless nights.	general
Simple changes in your daily habits can often help.	general
Waking up too early Daytime tiredness or sleepiness Irritability, depression or anxiety Increased errors or accidents Ongoing worries about sleep When to see a doctor If insomnia makes it hard for you to function during the day, see your doctor to identify the cause of your sleep problem and how it can be treated.	general
If your doctor thinks you could have a sleep disorder, you might be referred to a sleep center for special testing.	general
Insomnia may be the primary problem, or it may be associated with other conditions.	general
Chronic insomnia is usually a result of stress, life events or habits that disrupt sleep.	general
Treating the underlying cause can resolve the insomnia, but sometimes it can last for years.	general
Common causes of chronic insomnia include: Concerns about work, school, health, finances or family can keep your mind active at night, making it difficult to sleep.	general
Stressful life events or trauma ‚Äî such as the death or illness of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss ‚Äî also may lead to insomnia.	general
Your circadian rhythms act as an internal clock, guiding such things as your sleep-wake cycle, metabolism and body temperature.	general
Disrupting your body's circadian rhythms can lead to insomnia.	general
Causes include jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late or early shift, or frequently changing shifts.	general
Travel or work schedule.	general
Poor sleep habits include an irregular bedtime schedule, naps, stimulating activities before bed, an uncomfortable sleep environment, and using your bed for work, eating or watching TV.	general
Computers, TVs, video games, smartphones or other screens just before bed can interfere with your sleep cycle.	general
Poor sleep habits.	general
Having a light snack before bedtime is OK, but eating too much may cause you to feel physically uncomfortable while lying down.	general
Many people also experience heartburn, a backflow of acid and food from the stomach into the esophagus after eating, which may keep you awake.	general
Eating too much late in the evening.	general
Chronic insomnia may also be associated with medical conditions or the use of certain drugs.	general
Treating the medical condition may help improve sleep, but the insomnia may persist after the medical condition improves.	general
Additional common causes of insomnia include: Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, may disrupt your sleep.	general
Awakening too early can be a sign of depression.	general
Insomnia often occurs with other mental health disorders as well.	general
Mental health disorders.	general
Many prescription drugs can interfere with sleep, such as certain antidepressants and medications for asthma or blood pressure.	general
Many over-the-counter medications ‚Äî such as some pain medications, allergy and cold medications, and weight-loss products ‚Äî contain caffeine and other stimulants that can disrupt sleep.	general
Medications.	general
Examples of conditions linked with insomnia include chronic pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), overactive thyroid, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.	general
Medical conditions.	general
Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing periodically throughout the night, interrupting your sleep.	general
Restless legs syndrome causes unpleasant sensations in your legs and an almost irresistible desire to move them, which may prevent you from falling asleep.	general
Sleep-related disorders.	general
Coffee, tea, cola and other caffeinated drinks are stimulants.	general
Drinking them in the late afternoon or evening can keep you from falling asleep at night.	general
Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can interfere with sleep.	general
Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often causes awakening in the middle of the night.	general
Caffeine, nicotine and alcohol.	general
Insomnia and aging Insomnia becomes more common with age.	general
As you get older, you may experience: Sleep often becomes less restful as you age, so noise or other changes in your environment are more likely to wake you.	general
With age, your internal clock often advances, so you get tired earlier in the evening and wake up earlier in the morning.	general
But older people generally still need the same amount of sleep as younger people do.	general
Changes in sleep patterns.	general
You may be less physically or socially active.	general
A lack of activity can interfere with a good night's sleep.	general
Also, the less active you are, the more likely you may be to take a daily nap, which can interfere with sleep at night.	general
Changes in activity.	general
Chronic pain from conditions such as arthritis or back problems as well as depression or anxiety can interfere with sleep.	general
Issues that increase the need to urinate during the night ‚Äïsuch as prostate or bladder problems ‚Äï can disrupt sleep.	general
Sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome become more common with age.	general
Changes in health.	general
Older people typically use more prescription drugs than younger people do, which increases the chance of insomnia associated with medications.	general
More medications.	general
Insomnia in children and teens Sleep problems may be a concern for children and teenagers as well.	general
However, some children and teens simply have trouble getting to sleep or resist a regular bedtime because their internal clocks are more delayed.	general
They want to go to bed later and sleep later in the morning.	general
Risk factors Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night.	general
But your risk of insomnia is greater if: Hormonal shifts during the menstrual cycle and in menopause may play a role.	general
During menopause, night sweats and hot flashes often disrupt sleep.	general
Insomnia is also common with pregnancy.	general
You're a woman.	general
Because of changes in sleep patterns and health, insomnia increases with age.	general
You're over age 60.	general
Many issues that impact your mental or physical health can disrupt sleep.	general
You have a mental health disorder or physical health condition.	general
Stressful times and events can cause temporary insomnia.	general
And major or long-lasting stress can lead to chronic insomnia.	general
You're under a lot of stress.	general
For example, changing shifts at work or traveling can disrupt your sleep-wake cycle.	general
You don't have a regular schedule.	general
Complications Sleep is as important to your health as a healthy diet and regular physical activity.	general
Whatever your reason for sleep loss, insomnia can affect you both mentally and physically.	general
People with insomnia report a lower quality of life compared with people who are sleeping well.	general
Complications of insomnia may include: Lower performance on the job or at school Slowed reaction time while driving and a higher risk of accidents Mental health disorders, such as depression, an anxiety disorder or substance abuse Increased risk and severity of long-term diseases or conditions, such as high blood pressure and heart disease More Information Good sleep habits can help prevent insomnia and promote sound sleep: Keep your bedtime and wake time consistent from day to day, including weekends.	general
Stay active ‚Äî regular activity helps promote a good night's sleep.	general
Check your medications to see if they may contribute to insomnia.	general
Avoid or limit naps.	general
Avoid or limit caffeine and alcohol, and don't use nicotine.	general
Avoid large meals and beverages before bedtime.	general
Make your bedroom comfortable for sleep and only use it for sex or sleep.	general
Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading or listening to soft music.	general
Apple and pear body shapes Apple and pear body shapes People who have metabolic syndrome typically have apple-shaped bodies, meaning they have larger waists and carry a lot of weight around their abdomens.	general
It's thought that having a pear-shaped body ‚Äî that is, carrying more of your weight around your hips and having a narrower waist ‚Äî doesn't increase your risk of diabetes, heart disease and other complications of metabolic syndrome.	general
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.	general
These conditions include increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels.	general
Having just one of these conditions doesn't mean you have metabolic syndrome.	general
But it does mean you have a greater risk of serious disease.	general
And if you develop more of these conditions, your risk of complications, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, rises even higher.	general
Metabolic syndrome is increasingly common, and up to one-third of U.S. adults have it.	general
If you have metabolic syndrome or any of its components, aggressive lifestyle changes can delay or even prevent the development of serious health problems.	general
Products & Services Most of the disorders associated with metabolic syndrome don't have obvious signs or symptoms.	general
One sign that is visible is a large waist circumference.	general
And if your blood sugar is high, you might notice the signs and symptoms of diabetes ‚Äî such as increased thirst and urination, fatigue, and blurred vision.	general
When to see a doctor If you know you have at least one component of metabolic syndrome, ask your doctor whether you need testing for other components of the syndrome.	general
Metabolic syndrome is closely linked to overweight or obesity and inactivity.	general
It's also linked to a condition called insulin resistance.	general
Normally, your digestive system breaks down the foods you eat into sugar.	general
Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas that helps sugar enter your cells to be used as fuel.	general
In people with insulin resistance, cells don't respond normally to insulin and glucose can't enter the cells as easily.	general
As a result, your blood sugar levels rise even as your body churns out more and more insulin to try to lower your blood sugar.	general
Risk factors The following factors increase your chances of having metabolic syndrome: Your risk of metabolic syndrome increases with age.	general
In the United States, Hispanics‚Äî especially Hispanic women ‚Äî appear to be at the greatest risk of developing metabolic syndrome.	general
Carrying too much weight, especially in your abdomen, increases your risk of metabolic syndrome.	general
You're more likely to have metabolic syndrome if you had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) or if you have a family history of type 2 diabetes.	general
Your risk of metabolic syndrome is higher if you've ever had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome or sleep apnea.	general
Other diseases.	general
Complications Having metabolic syndrome can increase your risk of developing: If you don't make lifestyle changes to control your excess weight, you may develop insulin resistance, which can cause your blood sugar levels to rise.	general
Eventually, insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes.	general
Type 2 diabetes.	general
High cholesterol and high blood pressure can contribute to the buildup of plaques in your arteries.	general
These plaques can narrow and harden your arteries, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.	general
Heart and blood vessel disease.	general
A lifelong commitment to a healthy lifestyle may prevent the conditions that cause metabolic syndrome.	general
Intermittent explosive disorder involves repeated, sudden episodes of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior or angry verbal outbursts in which you react grossly out of proportion to the situation.	general
Road rage, domestic abuse, throwing or breaking objects, or other temper tantrums may be signs of intermittent explosive disorder.	general
These intermittent, explosive outbursts cause you significant distress, negatively impact your relationships, work and school, and they can have legal and financial consequences.	general
Intermittent explosive disorder is a chronic disorder that can continue for years, although the severity of outbursts may decrease with age.	general
Treatment involves medications and psychotherapy to help you control your aggressive impulses.	general
Explosive eruptions occur suddenly, with little or no warning, and usually last less than 30 minutes.	general
These episodes may occur frequently or be separated by weeks or months of nonaggression.	general
Less severe verbal outbursts may occur in between episodes of physical aggression.	general
You may be irritable, impulsive, aggressive or chronically angry most of the time.	general
Aggressive episodes may be preceded or accompanied by: Irritability Chest tightness The explosive verbal and behavioral outbursts are out of proportion to the situation, with no thought to consequences, and can include: Temper tantrums Threatening or assaulting people or animals You may feel a sense of relief and tiredness after the episode.	general
Later, you may feel remorse, regret or embarrassment.	general
When to see a doctor If you recognize your own behavior in the description of intermittent explosive disorder, talk with your doctor about treatment options or ask for a referral to a mental health professional.	general
Intermittent explosive disorder can begin in childhood ‚Äî after the age of 6 years ‚Äî or during the teenage years.	general
It's more common in younger adults than in older adults.	general
The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but it's probably caused by a number of environmental and biological factors.	general
Most people with this disorder grew up in families where explosive behavior and verbal and physical abuse were common.	general
Being exposed to this type of violence at an early age makes it more likely these children will exhibit these same traits as they mature.	general
Environment.	general
There may be a genetic component, causing the disorder to be passed down from parents to children.	general
There may be differences in the structure, function and chemistry of the brain in people with intermittent explosive disorder compared to people who don't have the disorder.	general
Differences in how the brain works.	general
Risk factors These factors increase your risk of developing intermittent explosive disorder: People who were abused as children or experienced multiple traumatic events have an increased risk of intermittent explosive disorder.	general
History of physical abuse.	general
People who have antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder or other disorders that include disruptive behaviors, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), have an increased risk of also having intermittent explosive disorder.	general
History of other mental health disorders.	general
Complications People with intermittent explosive disorder have an increased risk of: They're often perceived by others as always being angry.	general
They may have frequent verbal fights or there can be physical abuse.	general
These actions can lead to relationship problems, divorce and family stress.	general
Impaired interpersonal relationships.	general
Other complications of intermittent explosive disorder may include job loss, school suspension, car accidents, financial problems or trouble with the law.	general
Trouble at work, home or school.	general
Mood disorders such as depression and anxiety often occur with intermittent explosive disorder.	general
Problems with mood.	general
Problems with drugs or alcohol often occur along with intermittent explosive disorder.	general
Problems with alcohol and other substance use.	general
Medical conditions are more common and can include, for example, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, ulcers, and chronic pain.	general
Physical health problems.	general
Intentional injuries or suicide attempts sometimes occur.	general
If you have intermittent explosive disorder, prevention is likely beyond your control unless you get treatment from a professional.	general
Combined with or as part of treatment, these suggestions may help you prevent some incidents from getting out of control: Attend your therapy sessions, practice your coping skills, and if your doctor has prescribed medication, be sure to take it.	general
Your doctor may suggest maintenance medication to avoid recurrence of explosive episodes.	general
Stick with your treatment.	general
Regular use of deep breathing, relaxing imagery or yoga may help you stay calm.	general
Practice relaxation techniques.	general
Changing the way you think about a frustrating situation by using rational thoughts, reasonable expectations and logic may improve how you view and react to an event.	general
Develop new ways of thinking (cognitive restructuring).	general
Make a plan to find a way to solve a frustrating problem.	general
Even if you can't fix the problem right away, having a plan can refocus your energy.	general
Use problem-solving.	general
Listen to the message the other person is trying to share, and then think about your best response rather than saying the first thing that pops into your head.	general
Learn ways to improve your communication.	general
When possible, leave or avoid situations that upset you.	general
Also, scheduling personal time may enable you to better handle an upcoming stressful or frustrating situation.	general
Change your environment.	general
Don't use alcohol or recreational or illegal drugs.	general
Avoid mood-altering substances.	general
Colon and small intestine Colon and small intestine The small intestine and colon are components of your digestive tract, which processes the foods you eat.	general
The intestines extract nutrients from the foods.	general
What isn't absorbed by the intestines continues along the digestive tract and is expelled as stool during a bowel movement.	general
Intestinal ischemia (is-KEE-me-uh) describes a variety of conditions that occur when blood flow to your intestines decreases due to a blocked blood vessel, usually an artery.	general
Intestinal ischemia can affect your small intestine, your large intestine (colon) or both.	general
Intestinal ischemia is a serious condition that can cause pain and make it difficult for your intestines to work properly.	general
In severe cases, loss of blood flow to the intestines can damage intestinal tissue and possibly lead to death.	general
Treatments are available for intestinal ischemia.	general
To improve the chances of recovery, it's crucial to recognize the early symptoms and get medical help right away.	general
Signs and symptoms of intestinal ischemia can develop suddenly (acute) or gradually (chronic).	general
Signs and symptoms may be different from one person to the next, but there are some generally recognized patterns that suggest intestinal ischemia.	general
Symptoms of acute intestinal ischemia Signs and symptoms of acute intestinal ischemia typically include: Sudden abdominal pain that may be mild, moderate or severe An urgent need to have a bowel movement Frequent, forceful bowel movements Abdominal tenderness or distention Blood in your stool Signs and symptoms of chronic intestinal ischemia can include: Abdominal cramps or fullness, usually within 30 minutes after eating, and lasting one to three hours Abdominal pain that gets progressively worse over weeks or months Fear of eating because of subsequent pain Unintended weight loss When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical care if you have sudden, severe abdominal pain.	general
Pain that makes you so uncomfortable that you can't sit still or find a comfortable position is a medical emergency.	general
If you have other signs or symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with your doctor.	general
Intestinal ischemia occurs when the blood flow through the major arteries that supply blood to your intestines slows or stops.	general
The condition has many potential causes, including a blockage in an artery caused by a blood clot, or a narrowing of an artery due to buildup of deposits, such as cholesterol.	general
Blockages also can occur in veins, but they're less common.	general
Intestinal ischemia is often divided into categories: Colon ischemia (ischemic colitis) This type of intestinal ischemia, which is the most common, occurs when blood flow to the colon is slowed.	general
The cause of diminished blood flow to the colon isn't always clear, but a number of conditions can make you more vulnerable to colon ischemia: Dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension) associated with heart failure, major surgery, trauma or shock A blood clot in an artery supplying the colon Twisting of the bowel (volvulus) or trapping of intestinal contents within a hernia Excessive bowel enlargement from bowel obstruction caused by scar tissue or a tumor Other medical disorders that affect your blood, such as inflammation of your blood vessels (vasculitis), lupus or sickle cell anemia Medications that constrict blood vessels, such as some used to treat heart disease and migraine Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills Cocaine or methamphetamine use Acute mesenteric ischemia This type of intestinal ischemia usually affects the small intestine.	general
It has an abrupt onset and may be due to: and travels through your bloodstream to block an artery, usually the superior mesenteric artery, which supplies oxygen-rich blood to your intestines.	general
This is the most common cause of acute mesenteric artery ischemia and can be brought on by congestive heart failure, an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) or a heart attack.	general
A blood clot (embolus) that dislodges from your heart and slows or stops blood flow, often as a result of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) building up on the wall of an artery.	general
This type of sudden ischemia tends to occur in people with chronic intestinal ischemia.	general
A blockage that develops within one of the main intestinal arteries due to shock, heart failure, certain medications or chronic kidney failure.	general
This is more common in people who have other serious illnesses and who have some degree of atherosclerosis.	general
This type of acute mesenteric ischemia is often referred to as nonocclusive ischemia, which means that it's not due to a blockage in the artery.	general
Impaired blood flow resulting from low blood pressure Chronic mesenteric ischemia Chronic mesenteric ischemia, also known as intestinal angina, results from the buildup of fatty deposits on an artery wall (atherosclerosis).	general
The disease process is generally gradual, and you may not require treatment until at least two of the three major arteries supplying your intestines become severely narrowed or completely obstructed.	general
A potentially dangerous complication of chronic mesenteric ischemia is the development of a blood clot within a diseased artery, causing blood flow to be suddenly blocked (acute mesenteric ischemia).	general
Ischemia that occurs when blood can't leave your intestines A blood clot can develop in a vein draining deoxygenated blood from your intestines.	general
When the vein is blocked, blood backs up in the intestines, causing swelling and bleeding.	general
This is called mesenteric venous thrombosis, and it may result from: Acute or chronic inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis) Abdominal infection Bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or diverticulitis Disorders that make your blood more prone to clotting (hypercoagulation disorders), such as an inherited clotting disorder Medications such as estrogen that can increase clotting risk Abdominal injuries Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of intestinal ischemia include: If you've had other conditions caused by atherosclerosis, such as decreased blood flow to your heart (coronary artery disease), legs (peripheral vascular disease) or the arteries serving your brain (carotid artery disease), you have an increased risk of intestinal ischemia.	general
Buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries (atherosclerosis).	general
People older than 50 are more likely to develop intestinal ischemia.	general
Cigarettes and other forms of smoked tobacco increase your risk of intestinal ischemia.	general
Emphysema and other smoking-related lung diseases increase your risk of intestinal ischemia.	general
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	general
Your risk of intestinal ischemia is increased if you have congestive heart failure or an irregular heartbeat such as atrial fibrillation.	general
Heart problems.	general
Certain medications may increase your risk of intestinal ischemia.	general
Examples include birth control pills and medications that cause your blood vessels to expand or contract, such as certain allergy medications and migraine medications.	general
Medications.	general
Diseases and conditions that increase your risk of blood clots may increase your risk of intestinal ischemia.	general
Examples include sickle cell anemia and the Factor V Leiden mutation.	general
Blood-clotting problems.	general
Cocaine and methamphetamine use have been linked to intestinal ischemia.	general
Illegal drug use.	general
Complications Complications of intestinal ischemia can include: If blood flow to your intestine is completely and suddenly blocked, intestinal tissue can die (gangrene).	general
Death of intestinal tissue.	general
A hole through the wall of the intestines can develop.	general
This results in the contents of the intestine leaking into the abdominal cavity, causing a serious infection (peritonitis).	general
Perforation.	general
Sometimes the intestines can recover from ischemia, but as part of the healing process the body forms scar tissue that narrows or blocks the intestines.	general
Scarring or narrowing of your colon.	general
In some cases, intestinal ischemia is fatal.	general
Small intestine lining Small intestine lining The small intestine has a ridged lining covered with tiny fingerlike projections called villi.	general
Whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that most often affects your joints and digestive system.	general
Whipple disease interferes with normal digestion by impairing the breakdown of foods, such as fats and carbohydrates, and hampering your body's ability to absorb nutrients.	general
Whipple disease can also infect other organs, including your brain, heart and eyes.	general
Without proper treatment, Whipple disease can be serious or fatal.	general
However, a course of antibiotics can treat Whipple disease.	general
Common signs and symptoms Digestive signs and symptoms are common in Whipple disease and may include: Weight loss, associated with the malabsorption of nutrients Other frequent signs and symptoms associated with Whipple disease include: Inflamed joints, particularly the ankles, knees and wrists Less common signs and symptoms In some cases, signs and symptoms of Whipple disease may include: Enlarged lymph nodes Skin darkening (hyperpigmentation) in areas exposed to the sun and in scars Enlarged spleen Difficulty walking Memory loss Symptoms tend to develop slowly over many years in most people with this disease.	general
In some cases, symptoms such as joint pain and weight loss develop years before the digestive symptoms that lead to diagnosis.	general
When to see a doctor Whipple disease is potentially life-threatening, yet usually treatable.	general
Contact your doctor if you experience unusual signs or symptoms, such as unexplained weight loss or joint pain.	general
Your doctor can perform tests to determine the cause of your symptoms.	general
Even after the infection is diagnosed and you're receiving treatment, let your doctor know if your symptoms don't improve.	general
Sometimes antibiotic therapy isn't effective because the bacteria are resistant to the particular drug you're taking.	general
The disease can recur, so it's important to watch for the re-emergence of symptoms.	general
Whipple disease is caused by a type of bacterium called Tropheryma whipplei.	general
The bacteria affect the mucosal lining of your small intestine first, forming small lesions within the intestinal wall.	general
The bacteria also damage the fine, hairlike projections (villi) that line the small intestine.	general
Not much is known about the bacteria.	general
Although they seem readily present in the environment, scientists don't know where they come from or how they're spread to humans.	general
Not everyone who carries the bacteria develops the disease.	general
Some researchers believe that people with the disease may have a genetic defect in their immune system response that makes them more likely to become sick when exposed to the bacteria.	general
Whipple disease is extremely uncommon, affecting fewer than 1 in 1 million people.	general
Risk factors Because so little is known about the bacteria that cause Whipple disease, risk factors for the disease haven't been clearly identified.	general
Based on available reports, it appears more likely to affect: Men ages 40-60 White people in North America and Europe Farmers and other people who work outdoors and have frequent contact with sewage and wastewater Complications The lining of your small intestine has fine, hairlike projections (villi) that help your body absorb nutrients.	general
Whipple disease damages the villi, impairing nutrient absorption.	general
Nutritional deficiencies are common in people with Whipple disease and can lead to fatigue, weakness, weight loss and joint pain.	general
Whipple disease is a progressive and potentially fatal disease.	general
Although the infection is rare, associated deaths continue to be reported, due in large part to late diagnoses and delayed treatment.	general
Death often is caused by the spread of the infection to the central nervous system, which can cause irreversible damage.	general
Intracranial venous malformations are abnormally enlarged veins in your brain.	general
These enlargements aren't likely to cause symptoms or affect how the veins work.	general
Intracranial venous malformations might remain undetected or be found incidentally when you have a brain-imaging test for another condition.	general
Most often, this condition doesn't require treatment.	general
Intussusception Intussusception Intussusception is a rare, serious disorder in which one part of the intestine slides inside an adjacent part.	general
Intussusception (in-tuh-suh-SEP-shun) is a serious condition in which part of the intestine slides into an adjacent part of the intestine.	general
"This ""telescoping"" often blocks food or fluid from passing through."	general
Intussusception also cuts off the blood supply to the part of the intestine that's affected, which can lead to a tear in the bowel (perforation), infection and death of bowel tissue.	general
Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children younger than 3.	general
The cause of most cases of intussusception in children is unknown.	general
Though rare in adults, most cases of adult intussusception are the result of an underlying medical condition, such as a tumor.	general
In children, the intestines can usually be pushed back into position with an X-ray procedure.	general
In adults, surgery is often required to correct the problem.	general
The first sign of intussusception in an otherwise healthy infant may be sudden, loud crying caused by abdominal pain.	general
Infants who have abdominal pain may pull their knees to their chests when they cry.	general
The pain of intussusception comes and goes, usually every 15 to 20 minutes at first.	general
These painful episodes last longer and happen more often as time passes.	general
"Other frequent signs and symptoms of intussusception include: Stool mixed with blood and mucus (sometimes referred to as ""currant jelly"" stool because of its appearance) Not everyone has all of the symptoms."	general
Some infants have no obvious pain, and some children don't pass blood or have a lump in the abdomen.	general
Some older children have pain but no other symptoms.	general
Because intussusception is rare in adults and symptoms of the disorder often overlap with the symptoms of other disorders, it's more challenging to identify.	general
The most common symptom is abdominal pain that comes and goes.	general
Nausea and vomiting may also occur.	general
People sometimes have symptoms for weeks before seeking medical attention.	general
When to see a doctor Intussusception requires emergency medical care.	general
If you or your child develops the signs or symptoms listed above, seek medical help right away.	general
In infants, remember that signs of abdominal pain may include recurrent bouts of pulling the knees to the chest and crying.	general
Your intestine is shaped like a long tube.	general
In intussusception, one part of your intestine ‚Äî usually the small intestine ‚Äî slides inside an adjacent part.	general
This is sometimes called telescoping because it's similar to the way a collapsible telescope folds together.	general
In some cases, the telescoping is caused by an abnormal growth in the intestine, such as a polyp or a tumor (called a lead point).	general
The normal wave-like contractions of the intestine grab this lead point and pull it and the lining of the intestine into the bowel ahead of it.	general
In most cases, however, no cause can be identified for intussusception.	general
In the vast majority of cases of intussusception in children, the cause is unknown.	general
Because intussusception seems to occur more often in the fall and winter and because many children with the problem also have flu-like symptoms, some suspect a virus may play a role in the condition.	general
Sometimes, a lead point can be identified as the cause of the condition ‚Äî most frequently the lead point is a Meckel's diverticulum (a pouch in the lining of the small intestine).	general
In adults, intussusception is usually the result of a medical condition or procedure, including: A polyp or tumor Scar-like tissue in the intestine (adhesions) Weight-loss surgery (gastric bypass) or other surgery on the intestinal tract Inflammation due to diseases such as Crohn's disease Risk factors Risk factors for intussusception include: Children ‚Äî especially young children ‚Äî are much more likely to develop intussusception than adults are.	general
It's the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years.	general
Intussusception more often affects boys.	general
Intestinal malrotation is a condition in which the intestine doesn't develop or rotate correctly, and it increases the risk for intussusception.	general
Abnormal intestinal formation at birth.	general
Once you've had intussusception, you're at increased risk of developing it again.	general
A prior history of intussusception.	general
Siblings of someone who's had an intussusception are at a much higher risk of the disorder.	general
A family history.	general
Complications Intussusception can cut off the blood supply to the affected portion of the intestine.	general
If left untreated, lack of blood causes tissue of the intestinal wall to die.	general
Tissue death can lead to a tear (perforation) in the intestinal wall, which can cause an infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis).	general
Peritonitis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.	general
Signs and symptoms of peritonitis include: Abdominal pain Abdominal swelling Peritonitis may cause your child to go into shock.	general
Signs and symptoms of shock include: Cool, clammy skin that may be pale or gray A weak and rapid pulse Abnormal breathing that may be either slow and shallow or very rapid Anxiety or agitation Profound listlessness A child who is in shock may be conscious or unconscious.	general
If you suspect your child is in shock, seek emergency medical care right away.	general
Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands (lobules) of the breast.	general
Invasive cancer means the cancer cells have broken out of the lobule where they began and have the potential to spread to the lymph nodes and other areas of the body.	general
Invasive lobular carcinoma makes up a small portion of all breast cancers.	general
The most common type of breast cancer begins in the breast ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma).	general
Products & Services At its earliest stages, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause no signs and symptoms.	general
As it grows larger, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause: An area of thickening in part of the breast A new area of fullness or swelling in the breast A change in the texture or appearance of the skin over the breast, such as dimpling or thickening A newly inverted nipple Invasive lobular carcinoma is less likely than other forms of breast cancer to cause a firm or distinct breast lump.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
Your doctor will perform an examination and determine whether you need a diagnostic breast X-ray (mammogram) or a breast ultrasound.	general
Ask your doctor when to begin screening tests for breast cancer to help detect cancer early and before you may have any signs or symptoms.	general
Routine screening tests may include a physical exam and a mammogram.	general
Various organizations differ on their screening recommendations, but many suggest women with an average risk of breast cancer consider beginning mammograms in their 40s.	general
If you have a family history of breast cancer or other factors that increase your risk of breast cancer, your doctor may recommend beginning screening mammograms or other tests at an earlier age.	general
Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Each breast contains 15 to 20 lobes of glandular tissue, arranged like the petals of a daisy.	general
The lobes are further divided into smaller lobules that produce milk for breast-feeding.	general
Small tubes (ducts) conduct the milk to a reservoir that lies just beneath your nipple.	general
It's not clear what causes invasive lobular carcinoma.	general
Doctors know that invasive lobular carcinoma begins when cells in one or more milk-producing glands of the breast develop mutations in their DNA.	general
The mutations lead to the inability to control cell growth, which results in the cells dividing and growing rapidly.	general
Depending on the aggressiveness of the cancer type, the cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body.	general
Lobular carcinoma cells tend to invade breast tissue by spreading out in a distinct way rather than forming a firm nodule.	general
The affected area may have a different feel from the surrounding breast tissue, more like a thickening and fullness, but it's unlikely to feel like a lump.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of invasive lobular carcinoma include: Women are more likely to develop breast cancer, but men also can develop breast cancer.	general
Being female.	general
Your risk of breast cancer increases as you age.	general
Women with invasive lobular carcinoma tend to be a few years older than women diagnosed with other types of breast cancer.	general
If you've been diagnosed with LCIS ‚Äî abnormal cells confined within breast lobules ‚Äî your risk of developing invasive cancer in either breast is increased.	general
LCIS isn't cancer, but is an indication of increased risk of breast cancer of any type.	general
Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).	general
Use of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone during and after menopause has been shown to increase the risk of invasive lobular carcinoma.	general
Postmenopausal hormone use.	general
Women with a rare inherited condition called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome have an increased risk of both stomach (gastric) cancer and invasive lobular carcinoma.	general
Inherited genetic cancer syndromes.	general
Women with certain inherited genes may have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers.	general
To reduce your risk of breast cancer, consider trying to: Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer.	general
Discuss the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy with your doctor.	general
Some women experience bothersome signs and symptoms during menopause and, for these women, the increased risk of breast cancer may be acceptable in order to relieve menopause signs and symptoms.	general
To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time.	general
Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.	general
If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation.	general
For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.	general
Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week.	general
If you haven't been active lately, ask your doctor whether exercise is OK and then start slowly.	general
Exercise most days of the week.	general
If your current weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy weight-loss strategies.	general
Reduce the number of calories you eat each day and slowly increase the amount of exercise.	general
Aim to lose weight slowly ‚Äî about 1 or 2 pounds a week.	general
If you have a family history of breast cancer or feel you may have an increased risk of breast cancer, discuss it with your health care provider.	general
Preventive medications, surgery and more-frequent screening may be options for women with a high risk of breast cancer.	general

Eye with uvea Eye with uvea The uvea is a layer of tissue beneath the white of the eye (sclera).	general
It has three parts: the iris, which is the colored part of the eye; the ciliary body, which secretes the transparent liquid (aqueous humor) into the eye; and the choroid layer, which is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the sclera and the retina.	general
Iritis (i-RYE-tis) is swelling and irritation (inflammation) in the colored ring around your eye's pupil (iris).	general
Another name for iritis is anterior uveitis.	general
The uvea is the middle layer of the eye between the retina and the white part of the eye.	general
The iris is located in the front portion (anterior) of the uvea.	general
Iritis is the most common type of uveitis.	general
Uveitis is inflammation of part of or all of the uvea.	general
The cause is often unknown.	general
It can result from an underlying condition or genetic factor.	general
If untreated, iritis could lead to glaucoma or vision loss.	general
See your doctor as soon as possible if you have symptoms of iritis.	general
Iritis can occur in one or both eyes.	general
It usually develops suddenly, and can last up to three months.	general
Signs and symptoms of iritis include: Eye redness Sensitivity to light Decreased vision Iritis that develops suddenly, over hours or days, is known as acute iritis.	general
Symptoms that develop gradually or last longer than three months indicate chronic iritis.	general
When to see a doctor See an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) as soon as possible if you have symptoms of iritis.	general
Prompt treatment helps prevent serious complications.	general
If you have eye pain and vision problems with other signs and symptoms, you might need urgent medical care.	general
Often, the cause of iritis can't be determined.	general
In some cases, iritis can be linked to eye trauma, genetic factors or certain diseases.	general
Causes of iritis include: Blunt force trauma, a penetrating injury, or a burn from a chemical or fire can cause acute iritis.	general
Injury to the eye.	general
Viral infections on your face, such as cold sores and shingles caused by herpes viruses, can cause iritis.	general
Infections.	general
Infectious diseases from other viruses and bacteria can also be linked to uveitis.	general
For instance, they may include toxoplasmosis, an infection most often caused by a parasite in uncooked food; histoplasmosis, a lung infection that occurs when you inhale spores of fungus; tuberculosis, which happens when bacteria enters the lungs; and syphilis, which is caused by the spread of bacteria through sexual contact.	general
People who develop certain autoimmune diseases because of a gene alteration that affects their immune systems might also develop acute iritis.	general
Diseases include a type of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriatic arthritis.	general
Genetic predisposition.	general
An uncommon cause of acute iritis in Western countries, this condition is also characterized by joint problems, mouth sores and genital sores.	general
Behcet's disease.	general
Chronic iritis can develop in children with this condition.	general
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	general
This autoimmune disease involves the growth of collections of inflammatory cells in areas of your body, including your eyes.	general
Sarcoidosis.	general
Some drugs, such as the antibiotic rifabutin (Mycobutin) and the antiviral medication cidofovir, that are used to treat HIV infections can be a rare cause of iritis.	general
Rarely, bisphosphonates, used to treat osteoporosis, can cause uveitis.	general
Stopping these medications usually stops the iritis symptoms.	general
Certain medications.	general
Risk factors Your risk of developing iritis increases if you: People with a specific change in a gene that's essential for healthy immune system function are more likely to develop iritis.	general
This change is labeled HLA-B27.	general
Have a specific genetic alteration.	general
Certain infections, such as syphilis or HIV/AIDS, are linked with a significant risk of iritis.	general
Develop a sexually transmitted infection.	general
This includes conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis.	general
Have a weakened immune system or an autoimmune disorder.	general
Studies have shown that smoking contributes to your risk.	general
Smoke tobacco.	general
Complications If not treated properly, iritis could lead to: Development of a clouding of the lens of your eye (cataract) is a possible complication, especially if you've had a long period of inflammation.	general
Scar tissue can cause the iris to stick to the underlying lens or the cornea, making the pupil irregular in shape and the iris sluggish in its reaction to light.	general
An irregular pupil.	general
Recurrent iritis can result in glaucoma, a serious eye condition characterized by increased pressure inside the eye and possible vision loss.	general
This causes degeneration of your cornea and could decrease your vision.	general
Calcium deposits on the cornea.	general
Swelling and fluid-filled cysts that develop in the retina at the back of the eye can blur or decrease your central vision.	general
Swelling within the retina.	general
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) are a group of cancers that can occur in the hormone-producing cells of the pancreas.	general
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, also known as islet cell cancers, are very rare.	general
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors begin in small hormone-producing cells (islet cells) normally found in your pancreas.	general
Some pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cells continue to secrete hormones (known as functional tumors), creating too much of the given hormone in your body.	general
Examples of these types include gastrinoma and glucagonoma.	general
Many times these tumors do not secrete an excess amount of these hormones (known as nonfunctional tumors).	general
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors sometimes don't cause symptoms.	general
When they do, signs and symptoms can include: Stomach ulcers Low blood sugar It's not clear what causes most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.	general
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors occur when hormone-producing cells in the pancreas (islet cells) develop changes (mutations) in their DNA ‚Äî the material that provides instructions for every chemical process in your body.	general
DNA mutations cause changes in these instructions.	general
One result is that cells may begin to grow out of control and eventually form a tumor ‚Äî a mass of cancerous cells.	general
Sometimes the cancer cells break away and spread to other organs, such as the liver.	general
Some inherited syndromes increase the risk of this type of cancer, including: Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome Von Hippel-Lindau disease Tuberous sclerosis Risk factors Factors that are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors include: Men are much more likely than women to develop these tumors.	general
Being male.	general
If a family member was diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, your risk is increased.	general
You may have multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome, which increases the risk of this type of tumor.	general
A family history of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.	general
Itchy skin is an uncomfortable, irritating sensation that makes you want to scratch.	general
Also known as pruritus (proo-RIE-tus), itchy skin can be caused or worsened by dry skin.	general
It's common in older adults, as skin tends to become drier with age.	general
Depending on the cause of your itchy skin, it may appear normal, red, rough or bumpy.	general
Repeated scratching can cause raised thick areas of skin that might bleed or become infected.	general
Many people find relief with self-care measures such as moisturizing daily, using gentle cleansers and bathing with lukewarm water.	general
Long-term relief requires identifying and treating the cause of itchy skin.	general
Common treatments are medicated lotions, moist dressings and oral anti-itch medicines.	general
You may have itchy skin over certain small areas, such as on an arm or leg, or over your whole body.	general
Itchy skin can occur without any other noticeable changes on the skin.	general
Or it may be associated with: Leathery or scaly skin Sometimes itchiness lasts a long time and can be intense.	general
As you rub or scratch the area, it gets itchier.	general
And the more it itches, the more you scratch.	general
Breaking this itch-scratch cycle can be difficult.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor or a skin disease specialist (dermatologist) if the itching: Lasts more than two weeks and doesn't improve with self-care measures Is severe and distracts you from your daily routines or prevents you from sleeping Comes on suddenly and can't be easily explained Affects your whole body Is accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as extreme tiredness, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, or urinary frequency, fever or redness of the skin If the condition persists for three months despite treatment, see a dermatologist to be evaluated for skin disease and an internist to be evaluated for other diseases.	general
Causes of itchy skin include: Many skin conditions itch, including dry skin (xerosis), eczema (dermatitis), psoriasis, scabies, burns, scars, insect bites and hives.	general
Skin conditions.	general
Itchy skin can be a symptom of an underlying illness.	general
These include liver disease, kidney failure, iron deficiency anemia, thyroid problems and certain cancers, including multiple myeloma and lymphoma.	general
Internal diseases.	general
Conditions that affect the nervous system ‚Äî such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, pinched nerves and shingles (herpes zoster) ‚Äî can cause itching.	general
Nerve disorders.	general
Examples of psychiatric diseases that can cause itchy skin are anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.	general
Psychiatric diseases.	general
Wool, chemicals, soaps and other substances can irritate the skin and cause itching.	general
Sometimes the substance, such as poison ivy, parasites or cosmetics, causes an allergic reaction.	general
Also, reactions to certain drugs, such as narcotic pain medications (opioids) can cause itchy skin.	general
Irritation and allergic reactions.	general
During pregnancy, some women experience itchy skin.	general
Sometimes the cause of the itching can't be determined.	general
Complications Itchy skin that lasts more than six weeks (chronic pruritus) can affect the quality of your life, for example, by interrupting your sleep and causing anxiety or depression.	general
Prolonged itching and scratching may increase the intensity of the itch, possibly leading to skin injury, infection and scarring.	general
Jaw tumors and cysts are relatively rare growths or lesions that develop in the jawbone or the soft tissues in the mouth and face.	general
Jaw tumors and cysts, sometimes called odontogenic tumors and cysts, can vary greatly in size and severity.	general
These growths are usually noncancerous (benign), but they can be aggressive and invade the surrounding bone and tissue and may displace teeth.	general
Treatment options for jaw tumors and cysts vary, depending on the type of growth or lesion you have, the stage of growth, and your symptoms.	general
Mouth, jaw and face (oral and maxillofacial) surgeons can treat your jaw tumor or cyst usually by surgery, or in some cases, by medical therapy or a combination of surgery and medical therapy.	general
A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue.	general
A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material.	general
Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include: This is a relatively common, slow-growing, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor.	general
It develops most often in the jaw near the molars and can invade local structures such as bone and soft tissue.	general
This tumor can recur after treatment; however, aggressive surgical treatments will typically reduce the chance of recurrence.	general
Ameloblastoma.	general
Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw.	general
Some of these tumors can grow rapidly, can cause pain and destroy bone, and have a tendency to recur after surgical treatment.	general
The other types are less aggressive and may not have symptoms.	general
Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment.	general
Central giant cell granuloma.	general
This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth.	general
This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws.	general
Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth.	general
Dentigerous cyst.	general
Also referred to as keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment, this slow-growing, benign cyst can be destructive to local structures.	general
Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars.	general
These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.	general
Odontogenic keratocyst.	general
This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw.	general
The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth.	general
Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by aggressive surgical treatment.	general
Odontogenic myxoma.	general
This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor.	general
Odontomas often have no symptoms, but may interfere with tooth development or eruption.	general
Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw.	general
They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor.	general
These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes.	general
These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors, ameloblastic fibromas, glandular odontogenic cysts, squamous odontogenic tumors, calcifying odontogenic cysts, cementoblastomas, aneurysmal bone cysts, ossifying fibromas, osteoblastomas and central odontogenic fibromas to name a few.	general
Other types of cysts and tumors.	general
When to see a doctor If you're concerned that you may have symptoms of a jaw tumor or cyst, talk with your primary care doctor or dentist.	general
If necessary, he or she can refer you to the proper specialist for diagnosis and treatment.	general
Odontogenic jaw tumors and cysts originate from cells and tissues that are involved in normal tooth development.	general
Others tumors that affect the jaws can be nonodontogenic, meaning that they can develop from other tissues within the jaws that are not related to the teeth.	general
Generally, the cause of jaw tumors and cysts is not known; however, some are associated with genetic syndromes.	general
People with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, also called Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, lack a gene that suppresses tumors.	general
The genetic mutation that causes the syndrome is inherited.	general
This syndrome results in the development of multiple odontogenic keratocysts within the jaws, multiple basal cell skin cancers and other characteristics.	general
Jellyfish stings are relatively common problems for people swimming, wading or diving in seawaters.	general
The long tentacles trailing from the jellyfish body can inject you with venom from thousands of microscopic barbed stingers.	general
Jellyfish stings vary greatly in severity.	general
Most often they result in immediate pain and red, irritated marks on the skin.	general
Some jellyfish stings may cause more whole-body (systemic) illness.	general
And in rare cases jellyfish stings are life-threatening.	general
Most jellyfish stings get better with home treatment.	general
Severe reactions require emergency medical care.	general
"Burning, prickling, stinging pain Red, brown or purplish tracks on the skin ‚Äî a ""print"" of the tentacles' contact with your skin Throbbing pain that radiates up a leg or an arm Severe jellyfish stings can affect multiple body systems."	general
These reactions may appear rapidly or several hours after the stings.	general
Signs and symptoms of severe jellyfish stings include: Stomach pain, nausea and vomiting Difficulty breathing Heart problems The severity of your reaction depends on: The type and size of the jellyfish Your age, size and health, with severe reactions more likely in children and people in poor health How long you were exposed to the stingers How much of your skin is affected When to see a doctor Seek emergency treatment if you have severe symptoms.	general
Jellyfish tentacles contain microscopic barbed stingers.	general
Each stinger has a tiny bulb that holds venom and a coiled, sharp-tipped tube.	general
The jellyfish uses the venom to protect itself and kill prey.	general
When you brush against a tentacle, tiny triggers on its surface release the stingers.	general
The tube penetrates the skin and releases venom.	general
It affects the immediate area of contact and may enter the bloodstream.	general
Jellyfish that have washed up on a beach may still release venomous stingers if touched.	general
Types of jellyfish While many types of jellyfish are relatively harmless to humans, some can cause severe pain and are more likely to cause a systemic reaction.	general
These jellyfish cause more-serious problems in people: Box jellyfish can cause intense pain.	general
Life-threatening reactions ‚Äî although rare ‚Äî are more common with this type.	general
The more dangerous species of box jellyfish are in the warm waters of the Pacific and Indian oceans.	general
Box jellyfish.	general
Also called bluebottle jellyfish, Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish live mostly in warmer seas.	general
This type has a blue or purplish gas-filled bubble that keeps it afloat on the water and acts as a sail.	general
Portuguese man-of-war.	general
Common in both warm and cool seawaters, sea nettles live along the northeast coast of the United States and are abundant in the Chesapeake Bay.	general
Sea nettle.	general
These are the world's largest jellyfish, with a body diameter of more than 3 feet (1 meter).	general
They're most common in cooler, northern regions of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.	general
Lion's mane jellyfish.	general
Risk factors Conditions that increase your risk of getting stung by jellyfish include: Swimming at times when jellyfish appear in large numbers (a jellyfish bloom) Swimming or diving in jellyfish areas without protective clothing Playing or sunbathing where jellyfish are washed up on the beach Swimming in a place known to have many jellyfish Complications Delayed hypersensitivity reaction, causing blisters, rash or other skin irritations one to two weeks after the sting Irukandji syndrome, which causes chest and stomach pain, high blood pressure and heart problems The following tips can help you avoid jellyfish stings: When swimming or diving in areas where jellyfish stings are possible, wear a wet suit or other protective clothing.	general
"Diving stores sell protective ""skin suits"" or ""stinger suits"" made of thin, high-tech fabric."	general
Consider protective footwear as stings can also occur while wading in shallow water.	general
Wear a protective suit.	general
Talk to lifeguards, local residents or officials with a local health department before swimming or diving in coastal waters, especially in areas where jellyfish are common.	general
Get information about conditions.	general
Stay out of the water when jellyfish numbers are high.	general
Avoid water during jellyfish season.	general
Jet lag, also called jet lag disorder, is a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones.	general
Your body has its own internal clock, or circadian rhythms, that signals your body when to stay awake and when to sleep.	general
Jet lag occurs because your body's clock is still synced to your original time zone, instead of to the time zone where you've traveled.	general
The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag.	general
Jet lag can cause daytime fatigue, an unwell feeling, difficulty staying alert and gastrointestinal problems.	general
Jet lag is temporary, but it can significantly reduce your vacation or business travel comfort.	general
Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help prevent or minimize jet lag.	general
Symptoms of jet lag can vary.	general
You may experience only one symptom or you may have many.	general
Jet lag symptoms may include: Disturbed sleep ‚Äî such as insomnia, early waking or excessive sleepiness Daytime fatigue Stomach problems, constipation or diarrhea A general feeling of not being well Mood changes Symptoms worse the farther you travel Jet lag symptoms usually occur within a day or two of travel if you've traveled across at least two time zones.	general
Symptoms are likely to be worse or last longer the more time zones that you've crossed, especially if you travel in an easterly direction.	general
It usually takes about a day to recover for each time zone crossed.	general
When to see a doctor Jet lag is temporary.	general
But if you're a frequent traveler and continually struggle with jet lag, you may benefit from seeing a sleep specialist.	general
A disruption to your circadian rhythms Jet lag can occur anytime you cross two or more time zones.	general
Jet lag occurs because crossing multiple time zones puts your internal clock or circadian rhythms, which regulate your sleep-wake cycle, out of sync with the time in your new locale.	general
For example, if you leave New York on a flight at 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, and arrive in Paris at 7:00 a.m. Wednesday, your internal clock still thinks it's 1:00 a.m. That means you're ready for bed just as Parisians are waking up.	general
And because it takes a few days for your body to adjust, your sleep-wake cycle, along with most other body functions, such as hunger and bowel habits, remains out of step with the rest of Paris.	general
The influence of sunlight A key influence on your internal clock is sunlight.	general
That's because light influences the regulation of melatonin, a hormone that helps synchronize cells throughout the body.	general
Certain cells in the tissue at the back of your eye (retina) transmit the light signals to an area of your brain called the hypothalamus.	general
At night, when the light signal is low, the hypothalamus tells the pineal gland, a small organ situated in the brain, to release melatonin.	general
During daylight hours, the opposite occurs, and the pineal gland produces very little melatonin.	general
You may be able to ease your adjustment to your new time zone by exposing yourself to daylight in the new time zone so long as the timing of light is done properly.	general
Airline cabin pressure and atmosphere Some research shows that changes in cabin pressure and high altitudes associated with air travel may contribute to some symptoms of jet lag, regardless of travel across time zones.	general
In addition, humidity levels are low in planes.	general
If you don't drink enough water during your flight, you can get slightly dehydrated.	general
Dehydration may also contribute to some symptoms of jet lag.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase the likelihood you'll experience jet lag include: .	general
The more time zones you cross, the more likely you are to be jet-lagged.	general
"Number of time zones crossed You may find it harder to fly east, when you ""lose"" time, than to fly west, when you gain it back."	general
Flying east.	general
.	general
Pilots, flight attendants and business travelers are most likely to experience jet lag.	general
Being a frequent flyer .	general
Older adults may need more time to recover from jet lag than do younger adults.	general
Being an older adult Complications Motor vehicle accidents caused by drowsy driving may be more likely in people who are jet-lagged.	general
A few basic steps may help prevent jet lag or reduce its effects: If you have an important meeting or other event that requires you to be in top form, try to arrive a few days early to give your body a chance to adjust.	general
Arrive early.	general
Starting out sleep-deprived makes jet lag worse.	general
Get plenty of rest before your trip.	general
If you're traveling east, try going to bed one hour earlier each night for a few days before your departure.	general
Go to bed one hour later for several nights if you're flying west.	general
If possible, eat meals closer to the time you'll be eating them at your destination.	general
Gradually adjust your schedule before you leave.	general
Because light exposure is one of the prime influences on your body's circadian rhythm, regulating light exposure may help you adjust to your new location.	general
Regulate bright light exposure.	general
In general, exposure to light in the evening helps you adjust to a later than usual time zone (traveling westward), while exposure to morning light can help you adapt to an earlier time zone faster (traveling eastward).	general
The one exception is if you have traveled more than eight time zones from your original time zone, because your body might mistake early morning light for evening dusk.	general
Your body might also mistake evening light for early morning light.	general
So, if you've traveled more than eight time zones to the east, wear sunglasses and avoid bright light in the morning, and then allow as much sunlight as possible in the late afternoon for the first few days in your new location.	general
If you have traveled west by more than eight time zones, avoid sunlight a few hours before dark for the first few days to adjust to the local time.	general
Set your watch to the new time before you leave.	general
Once you reach your destination, try not to sleep until the local nighttime, no matter how tired you are.	general
Try to time your meals with local mealtimes too.	general
Stay on your new schedule.	general
Drink plenty of water before, during and after your flight to counteract the dehydrating effects of dry cabin air.	general
Dehydration can make jet lag symptoms worse.	general
Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as these can dehydrate you and affect your sleep.	general
Stay hydrated.	general
Earplugs, headphones and eye masks can help block out noise and light.	general
If it's daytime where you're going, resist the urge to sleep.	general
Try to sleep on the plane if it's nighttime at your destination.	general
Jock itch is characterized by an itchy, red rash on your genitals, inner thighs and buttocks.	general
It occurs in warm, moist areas of the body and is common in athletes and people who are overweight or sweat a great deal.	general
Jock itch (tinea cruris) is a fungal infection that affects the skin of your genitals, inner thighs and buttocks.	general
Jock itch causes an itchy, red, often ring-shaped rash in these warm, moist areas of your body.	general
Jock itch gets its name because it is common in people who sweat a lot, as do athletes.	general
It also is more likely to occur in people who are overweight.	general
Although often uncomfortable and bothersome, jock itch usually isn't serious.	general
Keeping your groin area clean and dry and applying topical antifungal medications usually are sufficient to treat jock itch.	general
Jock itch usually begins with a reddened area of skin that spreads out from the crease in the groin in a half-moon shape onto the upper thigh.	general
The border of the rash may consist of a line of small, raised blisters.	general
The rash often itches or burns, and the skin may be flaky or scaly.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have a rash on your skin that doesn't improve within two weeks or if you treat it with over-the-counter medications and it returns within a few weeks.	general
You may need prescription medication.	general
Jock itch is caused by a type of fungus that can be spread from person to person or from shared use of contaminated towels or clothing.	general
Jock itch is often caused by the same fungus that results in athlete's foot.	general
It's common for the infection to spread from the feet to the groin, as the fungus can travel on your hands or on a towel.	general
Risk factors The organisms that cause jock itch thrive in damp, close environments.	general
You're at greater risk of jock itch if you: Wear tight underwear Have diabetes Reduce your risk of jock itch by taking these steps: Keep your groin area dry.	general
Dry your genital area and inner thighs thoroughly with a clean towel after showering or exercising.	general
Use powder around your groin area to prevent excess moisture.	general
Change your underwear at least once a day or more often if you sweat a lot.	general
Wash workout clothes after each use.	general
Wear clean clothes.	general
Make sure your clothes fit correctly, especially underwear, athletic supporters and sports uniforms.	general
Avoid tightfitting clothes, which can rub and chafe your skin and make you more susceptible to jock itch.	general
Try wearing boxer shorts rather than briefs.	general
Find the correct fit.	general
Don't let others use your clothing, towels or other personal items.	general
Refrain from borrowing these items from others as well.	general
Don't share personal items.	general
Control any athlete's foot infection to prevent its spread to the groin.	general
If you spend time in moist public areas, such as a gym shower, wearing sandals will help prevent athlete's foot.	general
Treat athlete's foot.	general
Patellar tendinitis is an injury to the tendon connecting your kneecap (patella) to your shinbone.	general
The patellar tendon works with the muscles at the front of your thigh to extend your knee so that you can kick, run and jump.	general
Patellar tendinitis, also known as jumper's knee, is most common in athletes whose sports involve frequent jumping ‚Äî such as basketball and volleyball.	general
However, even people who don't participate in jumping sports can get patellar tendinitis.	general
For most people, treatment of patellar tendinitis begins with physical therapy to stretch and strengthen the muscles around the knee.	general
Products & Services Patellar tendinitis Patellar tendinitis Patellar tendinitis causes pain in the patellar tendon, which runs from the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone (tibia).	general
Pain is the first symptom of patellar tendinitis, usually between your kneecap and where the tendon attaches to your shinbone (tibia).	general
Initially, you may only feel pain in your knee as you begin physical activity or just after an intense workout.	general
Over time, the pain worsens and starts to interfere with playing your sport.	general
Eventually, the pain interferes with daily movements such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair.	general
When to see a doctor For knee pain, try self-care measures first, such as icing the area and temporarily reducing or avoiding activities that trigger your symptoms.	general
Call your doctor if your pain: Continues or worsens Patellar tendinitis is a common overuse injury, caused by repeated stress on your patellar tendon.	general
The stress results in tiny tears in the tendon, which your body attempts to repair.	general
But as the tears in the tendon multiply, they cause pain from inflammation and weakening of the tendon.	general
When this tendon damage persists for more than a few weeks, it's called tendinopathy.	general
Risk factors A combination of factors may contribute to the development of patellar tendinitis, including: Running and jumping are most commonly associated with patellar tendinitis.	general
Sudden increases in how hard or how often you engage in the activity also add stress to the tendon, as can changing your running shoes.	general
Physical activity.	general
Tight thigh muscles (quadriceps) and hamstrings, which run up the back of your thighs, can increase strain on your patellar tendon.	general
Tight leg muscles.	general
If some muscles in your legs are much stronger than others, the stronger muscles could pull harder on your patellar tendon.	general
This uneven pull could cause tendinitis.	general
Muscular imbalance.	general
Some illnesses disrupt blood flow to the knee, which weakens the tendon.	general
Examples include kidney failure, autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis and metabolic diseases such as diabetes.	general
Chronic illness.	general
Complications If you try to work through your pain, ignoring your body's warning signs, you could cause increasingly larger tears in the patellar tendon.	general
Knee pain and reduced function can persist if you don't tend to the problem, and you may progress to the more serious patellar tendinopathy.	general
To reduce your risk of developing patellar tendinitis, take these steps: As soon as you notice exercise-related knee pain, ice the area and rest.	general
Until your knee is pain-free, avoid activities that put stress on your patellar tendon.	general
Don't play through pain.	general
Strong thigh muscles are better able to handle the stresses that can cause patellar tendinitis.	general
Eccentric exercises, which involve lowering your leg very slowly after extending your knee, are particularly helpful.	general
Strengthen your muscles.	general
To be sure you're using your body correctly, consider taking lessons or getting professional instructions when starting a new sport or using exercise equipment.	general
Improve your technique.	general
Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep and mood issues.	general
Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals.	general
Fibromyalgia is commonly thought of as a condition that affects adults.	general
However, fibromyalgia also occurs in children and adolescents.	general
Estimates suggest that juvenile-onset fibromyalgia affects 2 to 6 percent of school children, mostly adolescent girls.	general
It is most commonly diagnosed between ages 13 and 15.	general
Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress.	general
In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event.	general
In children with fibromyalgia, symptoms include: The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months.	general
To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist.	general
Widespread diffuse pain.	general
Frequent headaches occur in a majority of patients with fibromyalgia.	general
Despite complaints of severe fatigue, these children often take an hour or more to fall asleep.	general
Even when they do fall asleep, many have difficulty maintaining sleep and wake up during the night.	general
Sleep disturbances.	general
People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time.	general
Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea.	general
"Many people who have fibromyalgia also may have pain or cramping in the lower abdomen, report cognitive impairment (described as feeling in a ""fog""), and experience depression and anxiety."	general
Other problems.	general
Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together.	general
These may include: Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder.	general
Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia.	general
Infections.	general
Post-traumatic stress disorder has been linked to fibromyalgia.	general
Physical or emotional trauma.	general
Why does it hurt?	general
Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change.	general
This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters).	general
In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in girls and women.	general
You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition.	general
Family history.	general
If you have a rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia.	general
Rheumatic disease.	general
Complications The pain and lack of sleep associated with fibromyalgia can interfere with the ability to function at school or at home.	general
The frustration of dealing with an often-misunderstood condition also can result in depression and anxiety.	general
Kaposi's sarcoma Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels.	general
The tumors (lesions) of Kaposi's sarcoma typically appear as painless purplish spots on the legs, feet or face.	general
Lesions can also appear in the genital area, mouth or lymph nodes.	general
In severe Kaposi's sarcoma, lesions may develop in the digestive tract and lungs.	general
The underlying cause of Kaposi's sarcoma is infection with a virus called human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).	general
In healthy people, HHV-8 infection usually causes no symptoms because the immune system keeps it under control.	general
In people with weakened immune systems, however, HHV-8 has the potential to trigger Kaposi's sarcoma.	general
People infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ‚Äî the virus that causes AIDS ‚Äî have the highest risk of Kaposi's sarcoma.	general
The immune system damage caused by HIV allows cells harboring HHV-8 to multiply.	general
Through unknown mechanisms, the characteristic lesions form.	general
Recipients of organ transplants who take immune system-suppressing drugs to prevent transplant rejection also are at risk of Kaposi's sarcoma.	general
In this population, though, the disease tends to be milder and easier to control than it is in people with AIDS.	general
Another type of Kaposi's sarcoma occurs in older men of Eastern European, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent.	general
Known as classic Kaposi's sarcoma, this cancer progresses slowly and typically causes few serious problems.	general
A fourth type of Kaposi's sarcoma that affects people of all ages occurs in equatorial Africa.	general
To determine if a suspicious-looking skin lesion is Kaposi's sarcoma, your doctor will need to perform a biopsy, which involves removing a small piece of tissue for examination in a laboratory.	general
Tests to diagnose internal Kaposi's sarcoma include: This test detects hidden blood in stool, which can be a sign of Kaposi's sarcoma in the digestive tract.	general
Fecal occult blood test.	general
A chest X-ray may reveal abnormalities suggesting Kaposi's sarcoma in the lung.	general
Chest X-ray.	general
In this test, a thin tube (bronchoscope) is passed through your nose or mouth into your lungs to view their lining and take samples of abnormal areas.	general
Bronchoscopy.	general
This test uses a thin tube (endoscope) passed through your mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach and first part of your small intestine.	general
If your doctor suspects Kaposi's sarcoma inside any of these organs, a biopsy of the affected tissue is taken to confirm the disease.	general
Upper endoscopy.	general
.	general
In this test, a thin tube (colonoscope) is passed through your rectum and advanced into your colon to examine the walls of these organs.	general
Abnormalities suggesting Kaposi's sarcoma in the rectum or colon can also be biopsied during colonoscopy.	general
Colonoscopy Bronchoscopy is unnecessary for diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma unless you have unexplained breathing problems or an abnormal chest X-ray.	general
Similarly, unless a fecal occult blood test finds blood in your stool, you may be able to avoid upper endoscopy or colonoscopy.	general
The treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma varies, depending on these factors: Historically, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma has been more serious than classic or transplant-related disease.	general
Thanks to increasingly effective antiviral drug combinations and improved prevention of other AIDS-related infections, Kaposi's sarcoma has become less common and less severe in people with AIDS.	general
Type of disease.	general
Widespread skin lesions and internal lesions require different treatment from isolated lesions.	general
Number and location of lesions.	general
Lesions in the mouth and throat make eating difficult, while lesions in the lung can cause shortness of breath.	general
Large lesions, particularly on the upper legs, can lead to painful swelling and difficulty moving around.	general
Effects of the lesions.	general
The immune system impairment that makes you vulnerable to Kaposi's sarcoma also makes certain treatments, such as powerful chemotherapy drugs, too risky to try.	general
The same is true if you also have another type of cancer, poorly controlled diabetes or any serious, chronic disease.	general
General health.	general
For AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, the first step in treatment is to start or switch to an antiviral drug combination that will reduce the amount of the virus that causes HIV/AIDS and increase the number of certain immune cells in your body.	general
Sometimes, this is the only treatment needed.	general
When possible, people with transplant-related Kaposi's sarcoma may be able to stop taking immune system-suppressing medication.	general
This allows the immune system to eliminate the cancer in some cases.	general
Switching to a different immunosuppressive medication can also bring improvement.	general
Treatments for small skin lesions include: Minor surgery (excision) Burning (electrodessication) or freezing (cryotherapy) Low-dose radiation, which is also helpful for lesions in the mouth Injection of the chemotherapy drug vinblastine directly into lesions Application of a vitamin A-like drug (retinoid) Lesions treated in any of these ways are likely to return within a couple of years.	general
When this happens, treatment can often be repeated.	general
Radiation is the usual treatment for those with multiple skin lesions.	general
The type of radiation used and the locations of lesions being treated vary from person to person.	general
When more than 25 lesions are present, chemotherapy with standard anti-cancer drugs may be helpful.	general
Chemotherapy is also used to treat Kaposi's sarcoma in the lymph nodes and digestive tract.	general
Kawasaki disease causes swelling (inflammation) in the walls of medium-sized arteries throughout the body.	general
It primarily affects children.	general
The inflammation tends to affect the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle.	general
Kawasaki disease is sometimes called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome because it also affects glands that swell during an infection (lymph nodes), skin, and the mucous membranes inside the mouth, nose and throat.	general
Signs of Kawasaki disease, such as a high fever and peeling skin, can be frightening.	general
The good news is that Kawasaki disease is usually treatable, and most children recover from Kawasaki disease without serious problems.	general
Products & Services Kawasaki disease signs and symptoms usually appear in three phases.	general
Signs and symptoms of the first phase may include: A fever that is often is higher than 102.	general
2 F (39 C) and lasts more than three days Extremely red eyes without a thick discharge A rash on the main part of the body and in the genital area Red, dry, cracked lips and an extremely red, swollen tongue Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and perhaps elsewhere Irritability In the second phase of the disease, your child may develop: Peeling of the skin on the hands and feet, especially the tips of the fingers and toes, often in large sheets Abdominal pain In the third phase of the disease, signs and symptoms slowly go away unless complications develop.	general
It may be as long as eight weeks before energy levels seem normal again.	general
When to see a doctor If your child has a fever that lasts more than three days, contact your child's doctor.	general
Also, see your child's doctor if your child has a fever along with four or more of the following signs and symptoms: Redness in both eyes Redness of the palms or soles Skin peeling Swollen lymph nodes Treating Kawasaki disease within 10 days of when it began may greatly reduce the chances of lasting damage.	general
No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease, but scientists don't believe the disease is contagious from person to person.	general
A number of theories link the disease to bacteria, viruses or other environmental factors, but none has been proved.	general
Certain genes may make your child more likely to get Kawasaki disease.	general
Risk factors Three things are known to increase your child's risk of developing Kawasaki disease.	general
Children under 5 years old are most at risk of Kawasaki disease.	general
Boys are slightly more likely than girls are to develop Kawasaki disease.	general
Children of Asian or Pacific Island descent, such as Japanese or Korean, have higher rates of Kawasaki disease.	general
Complications Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children.	general
However, with effective treatment, only a few children have lasting damage.	general
Heart complications include: Inflammation of blood vessels, usually the coronary arteries, that supply blood to the heart Inflammation of the heart muscle Heart valve problems Any of these complications can damage your child's heart.	general
Inflammation of the coronary arteries can lead to weakening and bulging of the artery wall (aneurysm).	general
Aneurysms increase the risk of blood clots, which could lead to a heart attack or cause life-threatening internal bleeding.	general
For a very small percentage of children who develop coronary artery problems, Kawasaki disease can cause death, even with treatment.	general
Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea ‚Äî the clear, dome-shaped tissue on the front of your eye that covers the pupil and iris.	general
Keratitis may or may not be associated with an infection.	general
Noninfectious keratitis can be caused by a relatively minor injury, by wearing your contact lenses too long or by a foreign body in the eye.	general
Infectious keratitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.	general
If you have eye redness or other symptoms of keratitis, make an appointment to see your doctor.	general
With prompt attention, mild to moderate cases of keratitis can usually be effectively treated without loss of vision.	general
If left untreated, or if an infection is severe, keratitis can lead to serious complications that may permanently damage your vision.	general
Eye redness Difficulty opening your eyelid because of pain or irritation Blurred vision Decreased vision When to see a doctor If you notice any of the signs or symptoms of keratitis, make an appointment to see your doctor right away.	general
Delays in diagnosis and treatment of keratitis can lead to serious complications, including blindness.	general
Causes of keratitis include: If any object scratches or injures the surface of your cornea, noninfectious keratitis may result.	general
In addition, an injury may allow microorganisms to gain access to the damaged cornea, causing infectious keratitis.	general
Bacteria, fungi or parasites ‚Äî particularly the microscopic parasite acanthamoeba ‚Äî may inhabit the surface of a contact lens or contact lens carrying case.	general
The cornea may become contaminated when the lens is in your eye, resulting in infectious keratitis.	general
Over-wearing your contact lenses can cause keratitis, which can become infectious.	general
Contaminated contact lenses.	general
The herpes viruses (herpes simplex and herpes zoster) may cause keratitis.	general
The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can cause keratitis.	general
Bacteria, fungi and parasites in water ‚Äî particularly in oceans, rivers, lakes and hot tubs ‚Äî can enter your eyes when you're swimming and result in keratitis.	general
However, even if you're exposed to these bacteria, fungi or parasites, a healthy cornea is unlikely to become infected unless there has been some previous breakdown of the corneal surface ‚Äî for example, wearing a contact lens too long.	general
Contaminated water.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of keratitis include: Wearing contact lenses ‚Äî especially sleeping in the lenses ‚Äîincreases your risk of both infectious and noninfectious keratitis.	general
The risk typically stems from wearing them longer than recommended, improper disinfection or wearing contact lenses while swimming.	general
Contact lenses.	general
Keratitis is more common in people who use extended-wear contacts, or wear contacts continuously, than in those who use daily wear contacts and take them out at night.	general
If your immune system is compromised due to disease or medications, you're at higher risk of developing keratitis.	general
Reduced immunity.	general
Use of corticosteroid eyedrops to treat an eye disorder can increase your risk of developing infectious keratitis or worsen existing keratitis.	general
Corticosteroids.	general
If one of your corneas has been damaged from an injury in the past, you may be more vulnerable to developing keratitis.	general
Eye injury.	general
Complications Chronic or recurrent viral infections of your cornea Open sores on your cornea (corneal ulcers) Temporary or permanent reduction in your vision Caring for your contact lenses If you wear contact lenses, proper use, cleaning and disinfecting can help prevent keratitis.	general
Follow these tips: Choose daily wear contacts, and take them out before going to sleep.	general
Wash, rinse and dry your hands thoroughly before handling your contacts.	general
Follow your eye care professional's recommendations for taking care of your lenses.	general
Use only sterile products that are made specifically for contact lens care, and use lens care products made for the type of lenses you wear.	general
Gently rub the lenses during cleaning to enhance the cleaning performance of the contact lens solutions.	general
Avoid rough handling that might cause your lenses to become scratched.	general
Replace your contact lenses as recommended.	general
Replace your contact lens case every three to six months.	general
Discard the solution in the contact lens case each time you disinfect your lenses.	general
"Don't ""top off"" the old solution that's already in the case."	general
Don't wear contact lenses when you go swimming.	general
Preventing viral outbreaks Some forms of viral keratitis can't be completely eliminated.	general
But the following steps may control viral keratitis occurrences: If you have a cold sore or a herpes blister, avoid touching your eyes, your eyelids and the skin around your eyes unless you've thoroughly washed your hands.	general
Only use eyedrops that have been prescribed by an eye doctor.	general
Washing your hands frequently prevents viral outbreaks.	general
Keratoconus Keratoconus In keratoconus, your cornea thins and gradually bulges outward into a cone shape.	general
This can cause blurry, distorted vision.	general
Keratoconus (ker-uh-toe-KOH-nus) occurs when your cornea ‚Äî the clear, dome-shaped front surface of your eye ‚Äî thins and gradually bulges outward into a cone shape.	general
A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare.	general
Keratoconus usually affects both eyes and generally begins to first affect people ages 10 to 25.	general
The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer.	general
In the early stages of keratoconus, you can correct vision problems with glasses or soft contact lenses.	general
Later, you may have to be fitted with rigid, gas permeable contact lenses or other types of lenses.	general
If your condition progresses to an advanced stage, you may need a cornea transplant.	general
Signs and symptoms of keratoconus may change as the disease progresses.	general
They include: Blurred or distorted vision Increased sensitivity to bright light and glare, which can cause problems with night driving A need for frequent changes in eyeglass prescriptions Sudden worsening or clouding of vision When to see a doctor See your eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) if your eyesight is worsening rapidly, which might be caused by an irregular curvature of the eye (astigmatism).	general
He or she may also look for signs of keratoconus during routine eye exams.	general
No one knows what causes keratoconus, although genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved.	general
Around 1 in 10 people with keratoconus also have a parent with the condition.	general
Risk factors Having a family history of keratoconus Rubbing your eyes vigorously Complications In some situations, your cornea may swell quickly and cause sudden reduced vision and scarring of the cornea.	general
This is caused by a condition in which the inside lining of your cornea breaks down, allowing fluid to enter the cornea (hydrops).	general
In advanced keratoconus, your cornea may become scarred, particularly where the cone forms.	general
A scarred cornea causes worsening vision problems and may require corneal transplant surgery.	general
Keratosis pilaris Keratosis pilaris Keratosis pilaris causes small bumps to appear on the upper arms, legs or buttocks.	general
They usually don't hurt or itch.	general
Keratosis pilaris (ker-uh-TOE-sis pih-LAIR-is) is a common, harmless skin condition that causes dry, rough patches and tiny bumps, usually on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks.	general
The bumps generally don't hurt or itch.	general
Keratosis pilaris is often considered a variant of normal skin.	general
It can't be cured or prevented.	general
But you can treat it with moisturizers and prescription creams to help improve the appearance of the skin.	general
The condition usually disappears by age 30.	general
Close-up of keratosis pilaris Close-up of keratosis pilaris Keratosis pilaris gives skin a goose-flesh or sandpaper-like appearance.	general
Typically patches are skin colored, but on light skin they can appear red and inflamed, as shown here.	general
Keratosis pilaris can occur at any age, but it's more common in young children.	general
Signs and symptoms include: Painless tiny bumps, typically on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks Dry, rough skin in the areas with bumps Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and skin tends to be drier Sandpaper-like bumps resembling goose flesh When to see a doctor Treatment for keratosis pilaris usually isn't necessary.	general
But if you're concerned about the appearance of your or your child's skin, consult your family doctor or a specialist in skin diseases (dermatologist).	general
He or she can often make a diagnosis by examining the skin and the characteristic scaly bumps.	general
Keratin plug Keratin plug Keratosis pilaris develops when keratin forms a scaly plug that blocks the opening of the hair follicle.	general
Usually plugs form in many hair follicles, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin.	general
Keratosis pilaris results from the buildup of keratin ‚Äî a hard protein that protects skin from harmful substances and infection.	general
The keratin forms a scaly plug that blocks the opening of the hair follicle.	general
Usually many plugs form, causing patches of rough, bumpy skin.	general
No one knows exactly why keratin builds up.	general
But it may occur in association with genetic diseases or with other skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis.	general
Dry skin tends to worsen this condition.	general
Seborrheic keratoses on the back Seborrheic keratoses on the back Seborrheic keratoses are very common on the back.	general
They appear as waxy light tan, brown or black growths that look as if they were dripped onto the skin by a candle.	general
Some can grow large, up to 1 inch (2.	general
5 centimeters) across.	general
Close-up of seborrheic keratoses Close-up of seborrheic keratoses Seborrheic keratoses are usually round or oval and range in color from light tan to black.	general
They can develop as a single growth or in clusters.	general
A seborrheic keratosis (seb-o-REE-ik ker-uh-TOE-sis) is a common noncancerous skin growth.	general
People tend to get more of them as they get older.	general
Seborrheic keratoses are usually brown, black or light tan.	general
The growths look waxy, scaly and slightly raised.	general
They usually appear on the head, neck, chest or back.	general
Seborrheic keratoses are harmless and not contagious.	general
They don't need treatment, but you may decide to have them removed if they become irritated by clothing or you don't like how they look.	general
A seborrheic keratosis usually looks like a waxy or wartlike growth.	general
It typically appears on the face, chest, shoulders or back.	general
You may develop a single growth, though multiple growths are more common.	general
"A seborrheic keratosis: Ranges in color from light tan to brown or black Is round or oval shaped Has a characteristic ""pasted on"" look Is flat or slightly raised with a scaly surface Ranges in size from very small to more than 1 inch (2."	general
5 centimeters) across See your doctor if: Many growths develop over a short time.	general
The growths get irritated or bleed when your clothing rubs against them.	general
You may want the growths removed.	general
You notice suspicious changes in your skin, such as sores or growths that grow rapidly, bleed and don't heal.	general
These could be signs of skin cancer.	general
Doctors don't know exactly what causes seborrheic keratoses.	general
The growths tend to run in some families, so genes may play a role.	general
Risk factors You're generally more likely to develop seborrheic keratoses if you're over age 50.	general
You're also more likely to have them if you have a family history of the condition.	general
Female urinary system Female urinary system Your urinary system ‚Äî which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra ‚Äî is responsible for removing waste from your body through urine.	general
Your kidneys, located toward the back in your upper abdomen, produce urine by filtering waste and fluid from your blood.	general
That urine then travels through your ureters to your bladder, where the urine is stored until you can eliminate it at an appropriate time.	general
Male urinary system Male urinary system Your urinary system ‚Äî which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra ‚Äî is responsible for removing waste from your body through urine.	general
Your kidneys, located toward the back in your upper abdomen, produce urine by filtering waste and fluid from your blood.	general
That urine then travels through your ureters to your bladder, where the urine is stored until you can eliminate it at an appropriate time.	general
Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI) that generally begins in your urethra or bladder and travels to one or both of your kidneys.	general
A kidney infection requires prompt medical attention.	general
If not treated properly, a kidney infection can permanently damage your kidneys or the bacteria can spread to your bloodstream and cause a life-threatening infection.	general
Kidney infection treatment, which usually includes antibiotics, might require hospitalization.	general
Abdominal pain Frequent urination Burning sensation or pain when urinating Nausea and vomiting When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have worrisome signs or symptoms.	general
If you're being treated for a urinary tract infection but your signs and symptoms aren't improving, make an appointment.	general
Severe kidney infection can lead to life-threatening complications.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if you have kidney infection symptoms combined with bloody urine or nausea and vomiting.	general
Bacteria that enter your urinary tract through the tube that carries urine from your body (urethra) can multiply and travel to your kidneys.	general
This is the most common cause of kidney infections.	general
Bacteria from an infection elsewhere in your body also can spread through your bloodstream to your kidneys.	general
Although it's unusual to develop a kidney infection, it can happen ‚Äî for instance, if you have an artificial joint or heart valve that becomes infected.	general
Rarely, kidney infection results after kidney surgery.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of a kidney infection include: The urethra is shorter in women than it is in men, which makes it easier for bacteria to travel from outside the body to the bladder.	general
The nearness of the urethra to the vagina and anus also creates more opportunities for bacteria to enter the bladder.	general
Being female.	general
Once in the bladder, an infection can spread to the kidneys.	general
Pregnant women are at even higher risk of a kidney infection.	general
This includes anything that slows the flow of urine or reduces your ability to empty your bladder when urinating ‚Äî including a kidney stone, something abnormal in your urinary tract's structure or, in men, an enlarged prostate gland.	general
Having a urinary tract blockage.	general
This includes medical conditions that impair your immune system, such as diabetes and HIV.	general
Certain medications, such as drugs taken to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, have a similar effect.	general
Having a weakened immune system.	general
Nerve or spinal cord damage can block the sensations of a bladder infection so that you're unaware when it's advancing to a kidney infection.	general
Having damage to nerves around the bladder.	general
Urinary catheters are tubes used to drain urine from the bladder.	general
You might have a catheter placed during and after some surgical procedures and diagnostic tests.	general
You might use one continuously if you're confined to a bed.	general
Using a urinary catheter for a time.	general
In vesicoureteral reflux, small amounts of urine flow from your bladder back up into your ureters and kidneys.	general
People with this condition are at higher risk of kidney infection during childhood and adulthood.	general
Having a condition that causes urine to flow the wrong way.	general
Complications If left untreated, a kidney infection can lead to potentially serious complications, such as: This can lead to chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure and kidney failure.	general
Kidney scarring.	general
Your kidneys filter waste from your blood and return your filtered blood to the rest of your body.	general
Having a kidney infection can cause the bacteria to spread through your bloodstream.	general
Blood poisoning (septicemia).	general
Women who develop a kidney infection during pregnancy may have an increased risk of delivering low birth weight babies.	general
Pregnancy complications.	general
Reduce your risk of kidney infection by taking steps to prevent urinary tract infections.	general
Women, in particular, may reduce their risk of urinary tract infections if they: Fluids can help remove bacteria from your body when you urinate.	general
Drink fluids, especially water.	general
Avoid delaying urination when you feel the urge to urinate.	general
Urinate as soon as you need to.	general
Urinating as soon as possible after intercourse helps clear bacteria from the urethra, reducing your risk of infection.	general
Empty the bladder after intercourse.	general
Wiping from front to back after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria from spreading to the urethra.	general
Wipe carefully.	general
Using products such as deodorant sprays in your genital area or douches can be irritating.	general
Avoid using feminine products in the genital area.	general
Kidney stones Kidney stones Kidney stones form in your kidneys.	general
As stones move into your ureters ‚Äî the thin tubes that allow urine to pass from your kidneys to your bladder ‚Äî signs and symptoms can result.	general
Signs and symptoms of kidney stones can include severe pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills and blood in your urine.	general
Female urinary system Female urinary system Your urinary system ‚Äî which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra ‚Äî is responsible for removing waste from your body through urine.	general
Your kidneys, located toward the back in your upper abdomen, produce urine by filtering waste and fluid from your blood.	general
That urine then travels through your ureters to your bladder, where the urine is stored until you can eliminate it at an appropriate time.	general
Male urinary system Male urinary system Your urinary system ‚Äî which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra ‚Äî is responsible for removing waste from your body through urine.	general
Your kidneys, located toward the back in your upper abdomen, produce urine by filtering waste and fluid from your blood.	general
That urine then travels through your ureters to your bladder, where the urine is stored until you can eliminate it at an appropriate time.	general
Kidney stones (renal lithiasis, nephrolithiasis) are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys.	general
Kidney stones have many causes and can affect any part of your urinary tract ‚Äî from your kidneys to your bladder.	general
Often, stones form when the urine becomes concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together.	general
Passing kidney stones can be quite painful, but the stones usually cause no permanent damage if they're recognized in a timely fashion.	general
Depending on your situation, you may need nothing more than to take pain medication and drink lots of water to pass a kidney stone.	general
In other instances ‚Äî for example, if stones become lodged in the urinary tract, are associated with a urinary infection or cause complications ‚Äî surgery may be needed.	general
Your doctor may recommend preventive treatment to reduce your risk of recurrent kidney stones if you're at increased risk of developing them again.	general
A kidney stone may not cause symptoms until it moves around within your kidney or passes into your ureter ‚Äî the tube connecting the kidney and bladder.	general
At that point, you may experience these signs and symptoms: Severe pain in the side and back, below the ribs Pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity Pain on urination Cloudy or foul-smelling urine Fever and chills if an infection is present Urinating small amounts Pain caused by a kidney stone may change ‚Äî for instance, shifting to a different location or increasing in intensity ‚Äî as the stone moves through your urinary tract.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs and symptoms that worry you.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if you experience: Pain so severe that you can't sit still or find a comfortable position Pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting Pain accompanied by fever and chills Blood in your urine Kidney stones often have no definite, single cause, although several factors may increase your risk.	general
Kidney stones form when your urine contains more crystal-forming substances ‚Äî such as calcium, oxalate and uric acid ‚Äî than the fluid in your urine can dilute.	general
At the same time, your urine may lack substances that prevent crystals from sticking together, creating an ideal environment for kidney stones to form.	general
Types of kidney stones Knowing the type of kidney stone helps determine the cause and may give clues on how to reduce your risk of getting more kidney stones.	general
If possible, try to save your kidney stone if you pass one so that you can bring it to your doctor for analysis.	general
Types of kidney stones include: Most kidney stones are calcium stones, usually in the form of calcium oxalate.	general
Oxalate is a naturally occurring substance found in food and is also made daily by your liver.	general
Some fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and chocolate, have high oxalate content.	general
Calcium stones.	general
Dietary factors, high doses of vitamin D, intestinal bypass surgery and several metabolic disorders can increase the concentration of calcium or oxalate in urine.	general
Calcium stones may also occur in the form of calcium phosphate.	general
This type of stone is more common in metabolic conditions, such as renal tubular acidosis.	general
It may also be associated with certain migraine headaches or with taking certain seizure medications, such as topiramate (Topamax).	general
Struvite stones form in response to an infection, such as a urinary tract infection.	general
These stones can grow quickly and become quite large, sometimes with few symptoms or little warning.	general
Struvite stones.	general
Uric acid stones can form in people who don't drink enough fluids or who lose too much fluid, those who eat a high-protein diet, and those who have gout.	general
Certain genetic factors also may increase your risk of uric acid stones.	general
Uric acid stones.	general
These stones form in people with a hereditary disorder that causes the kidneys to excrete too much of certain amino acids (cystinuria).	general
Cystine stones.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of developing kidney stones include: If someone in your family has kidney stones, you're more likely to develop stones, too.	general
And if you've already had one or more kidney stones, you're at increased risk of developing another.	general
Family or personal history.	general
Not drinking enough water each day can increase your risk of kidney stones.	general
People who live in warm climates and those who sweat a lot may be at higher risk than others.	general
Dehydration.	general
Eating a diet that's high in protein, sodium (salt) and sugar may increase your risk of some types of kidney stones.	general
This is especially true with a high-sodium diet.	general
Too much salt in your diet increases the amount of calcium your kidneys must filter and significantly increases your risk of kidney stones.	general
Certain diets.	general
High body mass index (BMI), large waist size and weight gain have been linked to an increased risk of kidney stones.	general
Being obese.	general
Gastric bypass surgery, inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea can cause changes in the digestive process that affect your absorption of calcium and water, increasing the levels of stone-forming substances in your urine.	general
Digestive diseases and surgery.	general
Diseases and conditions that may increase your risk of kidney stones include renal tubular acidosis, cystinuria, hyperparathyroidism, certain medications and some urinary tract infections.	general
Other medical conditions.	general
Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is often called the kissing disease.	general
The virus that causes mono is transmitted through saliva, so you can get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed through a cough or sneeze, or by sharing a glass or food utensils with someone who has mono.	general
However, mononucleosis isn't as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.	general
You're most likely to get mononucleosis with all the signs and symptoms if you're an adolescent or young adult.	general
Young children usually have few symptoms, and the infection often goes unrecognized.	general
If you have mononucleosis, it's important to be careful of certain complications such as an enlarged spleen.	general
Rest and adequate fluids are keys to recovery.	general
Sore throat, perhaps misdiagnosed as strep throat, that doesn't get better after treatment with antibiotics Swollen tonsils Soft, swollen spleen The virus has an incubation period of approximately four to six weeks, although in young children this period may be shorter.	general
Signs and symptoms such as a fever and sore throat usually lessen within a couple of weeks, but fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes and a swollen spleen may last for a few weeks longer.	general
When to see your doctor If you've been experiencing the above symptoms, you may have mononucleosis.	general
If your symptoms don't get better on their own in a week or two, see your doctor.	general
The most common cause of mononucleosis is the Epstein-Barr virus, but other viruses can also cause similar symptoms.	general
Although the symptoms of mononucleosis are uncomfortable, the infection resolves on its own without long-term effects.	general
Most adults have been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus and have built up antibodies.	general
Therefore, they're immune and won't get mononucleosis.	general
More Information Enlargement of the spleen Enlarged spleen Enlarged spleen The spleen is a small organ normally about the size of your fist.	general
A number of conditions, including liver disease and some cancers, can cause your spleen to become enlarged.	general
Mononucleosis may cause enlargement of the spleen.	general
In extreme cases, your spleen may rupture, causing sharp, sudden pain in the left side of your upper abdomen.	general
If such pain occurs, seek medical attention immediately ‚Äî you may need surgery.	general
Liver issues You may experience mild liver inflammation (hepatitis).	general
A yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) also occurs occasionally.	general
Less common complications Mononucleosis can also result in the following less common complications: ‚Äî a decrease in red blood cells and in hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein in red blood cells ‚Äî a low count of platelets, which are blood cells involved in clotting Thrombocytopenia ‚Äî an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) Heart problems ‚Äî meningitis, encephalitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome Complications involving the nervous system ‚Äî which can block breathing Swollen tonsils The Epstein-Barr virus can cause much more serious illness in people who have impaired immune systems, such as people with HIV/AIDS or people taking drugs to suppress immunity after an organ transplant.	general
More Information Mononucleosis is spread through saliva.	general
If you're infected, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others by not kissing them and by not sharing food, dishes, glasses and utensils until several days after your fever has subsided ‚Äî and even longer, if possible.	general
The Epstein-Barr virus may persist in your saliva for months after the infection.	general
No vaccine exists to prevent mononucleosis.	general
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that results when a boy is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome.	general
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition affecting males, and it often isn't diagnosed until adulthood.	general
Klinefelter syndrome may adversely affect testicular growth, resulting in smaller than normal testicles, which can lead to lower production of testosterone.	general
The syndrome may also cause reduced muscle mass, reduced body and facial hair, and enlarged breast tissue.	general
The effects of Klinefelter syndrome vary, and not everyone has the same signs and symptoms.	general
Most men with Klinefelter syndrome produce little or no sperm, but assisted reproductive procedures may make it possible for some men with Klinefelter syndrome to father children.	general
Signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome vary widely among males with the disorder.	general
Many boys with Klinefelter syndrome show few or only mild signs.	general
The condition may go undiagnosed until adulthood or it may never be diagnosed.	general
For others, the condition has a noticeable effect on growth or appearance.	general
Signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome also vary by age.	general
Weak muscles Slow motor development ‚Äî taking longer than average to sit up, crawl and walk Delay in speaking Problems at birth, such as testicles that haven't descended into the scrotum Boys and teenagers Taller than average stature Longer legs, shorter torso and broader hips compared with other boys Absent, delayed or incomplete puberty After puberty, less muscle and less facial and body hair compared with other teens Small, firm testicles Difficulty expressing thoughts and feelings or socializing Problems with reading, writing, spelling or math Low sperm count or no sperm Small testicles and penis Less muscular compared with other men Enlarged breast tissue Increased belly fat See a doctor if you or your son has: Delays in growth and development can be the first sign of a number of conditions that need treatment ‚Äî including Klinefelter syndrome.	general
Though some variation in physical and mental development is normal, it's best to check with a doctor if you have any concerns.	general
Slow development during infancy or boyhood.	general
Many men with Klinefelter syndrome aren't diagnosed with infertility until they realize they're unable to father a child.	general
Male infertility.	general
Klinefelter syndrome occurs as a result of a random error that causes a male to be born with an extra sex chromosome.	general
It isn't an inherited condition.	general
Humans have 46 chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes that determine a person's sex.	general
Females have two X sex chromosomes (XX).	general
Males have an X and a Y sex chromosome (XY).	general
Klinefelter syndrome can be caused by: One extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell (XXY), the most common cause An extra X chromosome in some of the cells (mosaic Klinefelter syndrome), with fewer symptoms More than one extra copy of the X chromosome, which is rare and results in a severe form Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome can interfere with male sexual development and fertility.	general
Risk factors Klinefelter syndrome stems from a random genetic event.	general
The risk of Klinefelter syndrome isn't increased by anything a parent does or doesn't do.	general
For older mothers, the risk is higher but only slightly.	general
Complications Anxiety and depression Social, emotional and behavioral problems, such as low self-esteem, emotional immaturity and impulsiveness Infertility and problems with sexual function Weak bones (osteoporosis) Breast cancer and certain other cancers Lung disease Metabolic syndrome, which includes type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and high cholesterol and triglycerides (hyperlipidemia) Autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Tooth and oral problems that make dental cavities more likely Autism spectrum disorder A number of complications caused by Klinefelter syndrome are related to low testosterone (hypogonadism).	general
Testosterone replacement therapy reduces the risk of certain health problems, especially when therapy is started at the beginning of puberty.	general
Klippel-Trenaunay (klih-PEL tray-no-NAY) syndrome ‚Äï also called KTS ‚Äï is a rare disorder found at birth (congenital) involving abnormal development of blood vessels, soft tissues (such as skin and muscles), bones, and the lymphatic system.	general
The main features include a red birthmark (port-wine stain), overgrowth of tissues and bones, and vein malformations with or without lymphatic abnormalities.	general
Although there is no cure for KTS, the goal is to manage symptoms and prevent complications.	general
People who have Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome may have the following features, which can range from mild to more extensive: This pink to reddish-purple birthmark is caused by extra tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the top layer of skin.	general
The birthmark usually covers part of one leg, but can involve any portion of the skin, and may get darker or lighter with age.	general
Port-wine stain.	general
These include swollen, twisted veins (varicose veins) usually on the surface of the legs.	general
Deeper abnormal veins in the arms, legs, abdomen and pelvis can occur.	general
There may be spongy tissue filled with small veins in or under the skin.	general
Venous abnormalities may become more prominent with age.	general
Vein malformations.	general
This begins in infancy and is usually limited to one leg, but it can occur in an arm or, rarely, in the trunk or face.	general
This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity.	general
Rarely, fusion of fingers or toes, or having extra fingers or toes occurs.	general
Overgrowth of bones and soft tissue.	general
The lymphatic system ‚Äî part of the immune system that protects against infection and disease and transports lymphatic fluid ‚Äî can be abnormal.	general
Extra lymphatic vessels can be present that don't work properly and can lead to leakage and swelling.	general
Lymphatic system abnormalities.	general
KTS can also include cataracts, glaucoma, hip dislocation at birth and blood-clotting problems.	general
Other conditions.	general
When to see a doctor Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is usually identified at birth.	general
It's important to get a prompt, accurate diagnosis and appropriate care to treat symptoms and prevent complications.	general
Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a genetic condition.	general
It involves genetic changes (mutations) most commonly in the PIK3CA gene.	general
These genetic changes are responsible for development of tissues in the body, resulting in overgrowth.	general
KTS is not usually inherited.	general
The gene mutations occur randomly during cell division in early development before birth.	general
Risk factors Family history doesn't seem to be a risk factor, so it's unlikely that parents of one child with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome will have another child with the disorder, even if one of the parents has KTS.	general
Complications Complications of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome can result from abnormal development of blood vessels, soft tissues, bones and the lymphatic system.	general
These can include: Some areas of the port-wine stain may thicken over time and may form blisters (blebs) that are prone to bleeding and infections.	general
Port-wine stain complications.	general
Varicose veins can cause major pain and skin ulcers due to poor circulation.	general
Deeper abnormal veins can increase the risk of blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) and cause a life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism if they dislodge and travel to the lungs.	general
Venous malformations in the pelvis and abdominal organs can cause internal bleeding.	general
Superficial veins can develop less serious but painful clots and inflammation (superficial thrombophlebitis).	general
Vein malformations.	general
Overgrowth of bone and tissue can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness, enlargement of the limb and problems with movement.	general
Overgrowth that causes one leg to be longer than the other can cause problems with walking and may lead to hip and back problems.	general
Overgrowth of bones and soft tissue.	general
An abnormality can cause fluid buildup and swelling in the tissues of the arms or legs (lymphedema), skin breakdown and skin ulcers, the development of small masses (lymphatic cysts) in the spleen, leakage of lymphatic fluid, or infection of the layer under the skin (cellulitis).	general
Lymphatic system abnormalities.	general
Pain can be a common problem that results from complications such as infections, swelling or vein problems.	general
Chronic pain.	general
Knee pain is a common complaint that affects people of all ages.	general
Knee pain may be the result of an injury, such as a ruptured ligament or torn cartilage.	general
Medical conditions ‚Äî including arthritis, gout and infections ‚Äî also can cause knee pain.	general
Many types of minor knee pain respond well to self-care measures.	general
Physical therapy and knee braces also can help relieve knee pain.	general
In some cases, however, your knee may require surgical repair.	general
Products & Services The location and severity of knee pain may vary, depending on the cause of the problem.	general
Signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany knee pain include: Swelling and stiffness Weakness or instability When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you: Can't bear weight on your knee or feel as if your knee is unstable (gives out) Have marked knee swelling Are unable to fully extend or flex your knee See an obvious deformity in your leg or knee Have a fever, in addition to redness, pain and swelling in your knee Have severe knee pain that is associated with an injury Knee pain can be caused by injuries, mechanical problems, types of arthritis and other problems.	general
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the key ligaments that help stabilize your knee joint.	general
The ACL connects your thighbone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia).	general
It's most commonly torn during sports that involve sudden stops and changes in direction ‚Äî such as basketball, soccer, tennis and volleyball.	general
Torn meniscus Torn meniscus The meniscus is a C-shaped piece of tough, rubbery cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between your shinbone and thighbone.	general
It can be torn if you suddenly twist your knee while bearing weight on it.	general
A knee injury can affect any of the ligaments, tendons or fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that surround your knee joint as well as the bones, cartilage and ligaments that form the joint itself.	general
Some of the more common knee injuries include: An ACL injury is a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ‚Äî one of four ligaments that connect your shinbone to your thighbone.	general
An ACL injury is particularly common in people who play basketball, soccer or other sports that require sudden changes in direction.	general
ACL injury.	general
The bones of the knee, including the kneecap (patella), can be broken during motor vehicle collisions or falls.	general
People whose bones have been weakened by osteoporosis can sometimes sustain a knee fracture simply by stepping wrong.	general
The meniscus is formed of tough, rubbery cartilage and acts as a shock absorber between your shinbone and thighbone.	general
It can be torn if you suddenly twist your knee while bearing weight on it.	general
Torn meniscus.	general
Some knee injuries cause inflammation in the bursae, the small sacs of fluid that cushion the outside of your knee joint so that tendons and ligaments glide smoothly over the joint.	general
Knee bursitis.	general
Tendinitis is irritation and inflammation of one or more tendons ‚Äî the thick, fibrous tissues that attach muscles to bones.	general
Runners, skiers, cyclists, and those involved in jumping sports and activities may develop inflammation in the patellar tendon, which connects the quadriceps muscle on the front of the thigh to the shinbone.	general
Patellar tendinitis.	general
Mechanical problems Some examples of mechanical problems that can cause knee pain include: Sometimes injury or degeneration of bone or cartilage can cause a piece of bone or cartilage to break off and float in the joint space.	general
This may not create any problems unless the loose body interferes with knee joint movement, in which case the effect is something like a pencil caught in a door hinge.	general
Loose body.	general
This occurs when the tough band of tissue that extends from the outside of your hip to the outside of your knee (iliotibial band) becomes so tight that it rubs against the outer portion of your femur.	general
Distance runners and cyclists are especially susceptible to iliotibial band syndrome.	general
Iliotibial band syndrome.	general
This occurs when the triangular bone (patella) that covers the front of your knee slips out of place, usually to the outside of your knee.	general
In some cases, the kneecap may stay displaced and you'll be able to see the dislocation.	general
Dislocated kneecap.	general
If you have hip or foot pain, you may change the way you walk to spare these painful joints.	general
But this altered gait can place more stress on your knee joint.	general
In some cases, problems in the hip or foot can cause knee pain.	general
Hip or foot pain.	general
Types of arthritis More than 100 different types of arthritis exist.	general
The varieties most likely to affect the knee include: Sometimes called degenerative arthritis, osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis.	general
It's a wear-and-tear condition that occurs when the cartilage in your knee deteriorates with use and age.	general
Osteoarthritis.	general
The most debilitating form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that can affect almost any joint in your body, including your knees.	general
Although rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease, it tends to vary in severity and may even come and go.	general
Rheumatoid arthritis.	general
This type of arthritis occurs when uric acid crystals build up in the joint.	general
While gout most commonly affects the big toe, it can also occur in the knee.	general
Often mistaken for gout, pseudogout is caused by calcium-containing crystals that develop in the joint fluid.	general
Knees are the most common joint affected by pseudogout.	general
Pseudogout.	general
Sometimes your knee joint can become infected, leading to swelling, pain and redness.	general
Septic arthritis often occurs with a fever, and there's usually no trauma before the onset of pain.	general
Septic arthritis can quickly cause extensive damage to the knee cartilage.	general
If you have knee pain with any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.	general
Septic arthritis.	general
Other problems Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a general term that refers to pain arising between the kneecap (patella) and the underlying thighbone (femur).	general
It's common in athletes; in young adults, especially those who have a slight maltracking of the kneecap; and in older adults, who usually develop the condition as a result of arthritis of the kneecap.	general
Risk factors A number of factors can increase your risk of having knee problems, including: Being overweight or obese increases stress on your knee joints, even during ordinary activities such as walking or going up and down stairs.	general
It also puts you at increased risk of osteoarthritis by accelerating the breakdown of joint cartilage.	general
Excess weight.	general
A lack of strength and flexibility can increase the risk of knee injuries.	general
Strong muscles help to stabilize and protect your joints, and muscle flexibility can help you achieve full range of motion.	general
Lack of muscle flexibility or strength.	general
Some sports put greater stress on your knees than do others.	general
Alpine skiing with its rigid ski boots and potential for falls, basketball's jumps and pivots, and the repeated pounding your knees take when you run or jog all increase your risk of knee injury.	general
Jobs that require repetitive stress on the knees such as construction or farming also can increase your risk.	general
Certain sports or occupations.	general
Having a previous knee injury makes it more likely that you'll injure your knee again.	general
Previous injury.	general
Complications Not all knee pain is serious.	general
But some knee injuries and medical conditions, such as osteoarthritis, can lead to increasing pain, joint damage and disability if left untreated.	general
And having a knee injury ‚Äî even a minor one ‚Äî makes it more likely that you'll have similar injuries in the future.	general
Although it's not always possible to prevent knee pain, the following suggestions may help forestall injuries and joint deterioration: Maintain a healthy weight; it's one of the best things you can do for your knees.	general
Every extra pound puts additional strain on your joints, increasing the risk of injuries and osteoarthritis.	general
Keep extra pounds off.	general
To prepare your muscles for the demands of sports participation, take time for conditioning.	general
Work with a coach or trainer to ensure that your technique and movement are the best they can be.	general
Be in shape to play your sport.	general
Make sure the technique and movement patterns you use in your sports or activity are the best they can be.	general
Lessons from a professional can be very helpful.	general
Practice perfectly.	general
Because weak muscles are a leading cause of knee injuries, you'll benefit from building up your quadriceps and hamstrings, which support your knees.	general
Balance and stability training helps the muscles around your knees work together more effectively.	general
And because tight muscles also can contribute to injury, stretching is important.	general
Try to include flexibility exercises in your workouts.	general
Get strong, stay flexible.	general
If you have osteoarthritis, chronic knee pain or recurring injuries, you may need to change the way you exercise.	general
Consider switching to swimming, water aerobics or other low-impact activities ‚Äî at least for a few days a week.	general
Sometimes simply limiting high-impact activities will provide relief.	general
Be smart about exercise.	general
Small intestine Small intestine The small intestine is a hollow tube that runs from the stomach to the large intestine (colon).	general
People with lactose intolerance are unable to fully digest the sugar (lactose) in milk.	general
As a result, they have diarrhea, gas and bloating after eating or drinking dairy products.	general
The condition, which is also called lactose malabsorption, is usually harmless, but its symptoms can be uncomfortable.	general
A deficiency of lactase ‚Äî an enzyme produced in your small intestine ‚Äî is usually responsible for lactose intolerance.	general
Many people have low levels of lactase but are able to digest milk products without problems.	general
If you're actually lactose intolerant, though, your lactase deficiency leads to symptoms after you eat dairy foods.	general
Most people with lactose intolerance can manage the condition without having to give up all dairy foods.	general
Products & Services The signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance usually begin 30 minutes to two hours after eating or drinking foods that contain lactose.	general
Common signs and symptoms include: When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you frequently have symptoms of lactose intolerance after eating dairy foods, particularly if you're worried about getting enough calcium.	general
Lactose intolerance occurs when your small intestine doesn't produce enough of an enzyme (lactase) to digest milk sugar (lactose).	general
Normally, lactase turns milk sugar into two simple sugars ‚Äî glucose and galactose ‚Äî which are absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestinal lining.	general
If you're lactase deficient, lactose in your food moves into the colon instead of being processed and absorbed.	general
In the colon, normal bacteria interact with undigested lactose, causing the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance.	general
There are three types of lactose intolerance.	general
Different factors cause the lactase deficiency underlying each type.	general
Primary lactose intolerance This is the most common type of lactose intolerance.	general
People who develop primary lactose intolerance start life producing plenty of lactase ‚Äî a necessity for infants, who get all their nutrition from milk.	general
As children replace milk with other foods, their lactase production normally decreases, but remains high enough to digest the amount of dairy in a typical adult diet.	general
In primary lactose intolerance, lactase production falls off sharply, making milk products difficult to digest by adulthood.	general
Primary lactose intolerance is genetically determined, occurring in a large proportion of people with African, Asian or Hispanic ancestry.	general
The condition is also common among those of Mediterranean or Southern European descent.	general
Secondary lactose intolerance This form of lactose intolerance occurs when your small intestine decreases lactase production after an illness, injury or surgery involving your small intestine.	general
Among the diseases associated with secondary lactose intolerance are celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth and Crohn's disease.	general
Treatment of the underlying disorder may restore lactase levels and improve signs and symptoms, though it can take time.	general
Congenital or developmental lactose intolerance It's possible, but rare, for babies to be born with lactose intolerance caused by a complete absence of lactase activity.	general
This disorder is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive, meaning that both the mother and the father must pass on the same gene variant for a child to be affected.	general
Premature infants may also have lactose intolerance because of an insufficient lactase level.	general
Risk factors Factors that can make you or your child more prone to lactose intolerance include: Lactose intolerance usually appears in adulthood.	general
The condition is uncommon in babies and young children.	general
Increasing age.	general
Lactose intolerance is most common in people of African, Asian, Hispanic and American Indian descent.	general
Infants born prematurely may have reduced levels of lactase because the small intestine doesn't develop lactase-producing cells until late in the third trimester.	general
Premature birth.	general
Small intestine problems that can cause lactose intolerance include bacterial overgrowth, celiac disease and Crohn's disease.	general
Diseases affecting the small intestine.	general
If you have received radiation therapy for cancer in your abdomen or have intestinal complications from chemotherapy, you have an increased risk of lactose intolerance.	general
Certain cancer treatments.	general
Lobular carcinoma in situ Lobular carcinoma in situ Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) develops in a milk-producing gland (lobule) and does not spread into nearby breast tissue.	general
Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is an uncommon condition in which abnormal cells form in the milk glands (lobules) in the breast.	general
LCIS isn't cancer.	general
But being diagnosed with LCIS indicates that you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.	general
LCIS usually doesn't show up on mammograms.	general
The condition is most often discovered as a result of a breast biopsy done for another reason, such as a suspicious breast lump or an abnormal mammogram.	general
Women with LCIS have an increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer in either breast.	general
If you're diagnosed with LCIS, your doctor may recommend increased breast cancer screening and may ask you to consider medical treatments to reduce your risk of developing invasive breast cancer.	general
Products & Services LCIS doesn't cause signs or symptoms.	general
Rather, your doctor might discover incidentally that you have LCIS ‚Äî for instance, after a biopsy to assess a breast lump or an abnormal area found on a mammogram.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice a change in your breasts, such as a lump, an area of puckered or otherwise unusual skin, a thickened region under the skin, or nipple discharge.	general
Ask your doctor when you should consider breast cancer screening and how often it should be repeated.	general
Most groups recommend considering routine breast cancer screening beginning in your 40s.	general
Talk with your doctor about what's right for you.	general
Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Each breast contains 15 to 20 lobes of glandular tissue, arranged like the petals of a daisy.	general
The lobes are further divided into smaller lobules that produce milk for breast-feeding.	general
Small tubes (ducts) conduct the milk to a reservoir that lies just beneath your nipple.	general
It's not clear what causes LCIS.	general
LCIS begins when cells in a milk-producing gland (lobule) of a breast develop genetic mutations that cause the cells to appear abnormal.	general
The abnormal cells remain in the lobule and don't extend into, or invade, nearby breast tissue.	general
If LCIS is detected in a breast biopsy, it doesn't mean that you have cancer.	general
But having LCIS increases your risk of breast cancer and makes it more likely that you may develop invasive breast cancer.	general
The risk of breast cancer in women diagnosed with LCIS is thought to be approximately 20 percent.	general
Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with LCIS, 20 will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 80 won't be diagnosed with breast cancer.	general
The risk of developing breast cancer for women in general is thought to be 12 percent.	general
Put another way, for every 100 women in the general population, 12 will be diagnosed with breast cancer.	general
Your individual risk of breast cancer is based on many factors.	general
Talk to your doctor to better understand your personal risk of breast cancer.	general
Lead poisoning occurs when lead builds up in the body, often over months or years.	general
Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems.	general
Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development.	general
At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.	general
Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are the most common sources of lead poisoning in children.	general
Other sources include contaminated air, water and soil.	general
Adults who work with batteries, do home renovations or work in auto repair shops also might be exposed to lead.	general
There is treatment for lead poisoning, but taking some simple precautions can help protect you and your family from lead exposure before harm is done.	general
Initially, lead poisoning can be hard to detect ‚Äî even people who seem healthy can have high blood levels of lead.	general
Signs and symptoms usually don't appear until dangerous amounts have accumulated.	general
Lead poisoning symptoms in children Signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in children include: Developmental delay Learning difficulties Eating things, such as paint chips, that aren't food (pica) Lead poisoning symptoms in newborns Babies exposed to lead before birth might: Be born prematurely Lead poisoning symptoms in adults Although children are primarily at risk, lead poisoning is also dangerous for adults.	general
Signs and symptoms in adults might include: High blood pressure Miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth in pregnant women Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust, but human activity ‚Äî mining, burning fossil fuels and manufacturing ‚Äî has caused it to become more widespread.	general
Lead was also once used in paint and gasoline and is still used in batteries, solder, pipes, pottery, roofing materials and some cosmetics.	general
Lead in paint Lead-based paints for homes, children's toys and household furniture have been banned in the United States since 1978.	general
But lead-based paint is still on walls and woodwork in many older homes and apartments.	general
Most lead poisoning in children results from eating chips of deteriorating lead-based paint.	general
Water pipes and imported canned goods Lead pipes, brass plumbing fixtures and copper pipes soldered with lead can release lead particles into tap water.	general
Lead solder in food cans, banned in the United States, is still used in some countries.	general
Other sources of lead exposure Lead sometimes can also be found in: Lead particles from leaded gasoline or paint settle on soil and can last years.	general
Lead-contaminated soil is still a major problem around highways and in some urban settings.	general
Some soil close to walls of older houses contains lead.	general
Household dust can contain lead from lead paint chips or from contaminated soil brought in from outside.	general
Household dust.	general
Glazes found on some ceramics, china and porcelain can contain lead that can leach into food served or stored in the pottery.	general
Lead is sometimes found in toys and other products produced abroad.	general
Tiro, an eye cosmetic from Nigeria, has been linked to lead poisoning.	general
Lead poisoning has been linked to greta and azarcon, traditional Hispanic medicines, as well as some from India, China and other countries.	general
Herbal or folk remedies.	general
Tamarind, an ingredient used in some candies made in Mexico, might contain lead.	general
Mexican candy.	general
Time spent at firing ranges can lead to exposure.	general
Lead bullets.	general
People are exposed to lead and can bring it home on their clothes when they work in auto repair, mining, pipe fitting, battery manufacturing, painting, construction and certain other fields.	general
Occupations.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of lead poisoning include: Infants and young children are more likely to be exposed to lead than are older children.	general
They might chew paint that flakes off walls and woodwork, and their hands can be contaminated with lead dust.	general
Young children also absorb lead more easily, and it's more harmful for them than it is for adults and older children.	general
Although the use of lead-based paints has been banned since the 1970s, older homes and buildings often retain remnants of this paint.	general
People renovating an older home are at even higher risk.	general
Living in an older home.	general
Making stained glass and some jewelry requires the use of lead solder.	general
Refinishing old furniture might put you in contact with layers of lead paint.	general
Certain hobbies.	general
Developing countries often have less strict rules regarding exposure to lead than do developed countries.	general
American families who adopt a child from another country might want to have the child's blood tested for lead poisoning.	general
Immigrant and refugee children also should be tested.	general
Living in developing countries.	general
Lead can harm an unborn child, so pregnant women or women likely to become pregnant should be especially careful to avoid exposure to lead.	general
Complications Exposure to even low levels of lead can cause damage over time, especially in children.	general
The greatest risk is to brain development, where irreversible damage can occur.	general
Higher levels can damage the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults.	general
Very high lead levels may cause seizures, unconsciousness and death.	general
Simple measures can help protect you and your family from lead poisoning: To help reduce hand-to-mouth transfer of contaminated dust or soil, wash your children's hands after outdoor play, before eating and at bedtime.	general
Wash their toys regularly.	general
Wash hands and toys.	general
Clean your floors with a wet mop and wipe furniture, windowsills and other dusty surfaces with a damp cloth.	general
Clean dusty surfaces.	general
This will help keep lead-based soil outside.	general
Remove shoes before entering the house.	general
If you have older plumbing containing lead pipes or fittings, run your cold water for at least a minute before using.	general
Don't use hot tap water to make baby formula or for cooking.	general
Run cold water.	general
Provide them with a sandbox that's covered when not in use.	general
Plant grass or cover bare soil with mulch.	general
Prevent children from playing on soil.	general
Regular meals and good nutrition might help lower lead absorption.	general
Children especially need enough calcium, vitamin C and iron in their diets to help keep lead from being absorbed.	general
Eat a healthy diet.	general
If your home has lead-based paint, check regularly for peeling paint and fix problems promptly.	general
Try not to sand, which generates dust particles that contain lead.	general
Keep your home well-maintained.	general
Left ventricular hypertrophy Left ventricular hypertrophy Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber.	general
This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action.	general
The most common cause is high blood pressure.	general
Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle).	general
Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor ‚Äî such as high blood pressure or a heart condition ‚Äî that causes the left ventricle to work harder.	general
As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.	general
The enlarged heart muscle loses elasticity and eventually may fail to pump with as much force as needed.	general
Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure.	general
But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk of a heart attack and stroke.	general
Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.	general
Products & Services Left ventricular hypertrophy usually develops gradually.	general
You may experience no signs or symptoms, especially during the early stages of the condition.	general
As left ventricular hypertrophy progresses, you may experience: Shortness of breath Sensation of rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats (palpitations) Dizziness or fainting Seek emergency care if: You feel chest pain that lasts more than a few minutes You have severe difficulty breathing You have severe lightheadedness or lose consciousness If you experience mild shortness of breath or other symptoms, such as palpitations, see your doctor.	general
If you have high blood pressure or another condition that increases your risk of left ventricular hypertrophy, your doctor is likely to recommend regular appointments to monitor your heart.	general
Even if you feel well, you need to have your blood pressure checked annually, or more often if you: Are overweight Have other conditions that increase the risk of high blood pressure Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body.	general
Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy.	general
More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.	general
High blood pressure (hypertension).	general
This disease is a narrowing of the aortic valve that separates the left ventricle from the large blood vessel leaving your heart (aorta).	general
The narrowing of the aortic valve requires the left ventricle to work harder to pump blood into the aorta.	general
Aortic valve stenosis.	general
This genetic disease occurs when the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, even with completely normal blood pressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood.	general
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	general
Intense, prolonged endurance and strength training can cause the heart to adapt to handle the extra workload.	general
It's unclear whether this athletic type of left ventricle hypertrophy can lead to stiffening of the heart muscle and disease.	general
Athletic training.	general
Risk factors In addition to hypertension and aortic valve stenosis, factors that increase your risk of left ventricular hypertrophy include: Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in older people.	general
Being overweight increases your risk of high blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy.	general
Certain genetic conditions are associated with developing left ventricular hypertrophy.	general
Family history.	general
Left ventricular hypertrophy has been found to be linked to a higher risk of diabetes.	general
African-Americans are at higher risk of left ventricular hypertrophy than are white people with similar blood pressure measurements.	general
Women with hypertension are at higher risk of left ventricular hypertrophy than are men with similar blood pressure measurements.	general
Complications Left ventricular hypertrophy changes the structure and working of the heart.	general
The enlarged left ventricle can: Stiffen and lose elasticity, preventing the chamber from filling properly and increasing pressure in the heart Compress the chamber's blood vessels (coronary arteries) and restrict its supply of blood As a result of these changes, complications of left ventricular hypertrophy include: Reduced blood supply to the heart Inability of the heart to pump enough blood to your body (heart failure) Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) Irregular, often rapid heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) that decreases blood flow to the body Insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart(ischemic heart disease) Sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness (sudden cardiac arrest) The best way to prevent left ventricular hypertrophy caused by high blood pressure is to maintain healthy blood pressure.	general
To better manage your blood pressure: Purchase a home blood pressure measuring device and check your blood pressure frequently.	general
Schedule regular checkups with your doctor.	general
Monitor high blood pressure.	general
Regular physical activity helps to lower blood pressure and keep it at normal levels.	general
Aim for 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week.	general
Make time for physical activity.	general
Avoid foods that are high in saturated fat and salt, and eat more fruits and vegetables.	general
Avoid alcoholic beverages or drink them in moderation.	general
Eat a healthy diet.	general
Giving up smoking improves your overall health and prevents heart attacks.	general
Quit smoking.	general
Hip and joint components Hip and joint components The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint.	general
The ball (femoral head) is at the top of the thighbone (femur) and the socket (acetabulum) is part of the hip bone.	general
Legg-Calve-Perthes (LEG-kahl-VAY-PER-tuz) disease is a childhood condition that occurs when blood supply to the ball part (femoral head) of the hip joint is temporarily interrupted and the bone begins to die.	general
This weakened bone gradually breaks apart and can lose its round shape.	general
The body eventually restores blood supply to the ball, and the ball heals.	general
But if the ball is no longer round after it heals, it can cause pain and stiffness.	general
The complete process of bone death, fracture and renewal can take several years.	general
To keep the ball part of the joint as round as possible, doctors may use a variety of treatments that keep it snug in the socket portion of the joint.	general
The socket acts as a mold for the fragmented femoral head as it heals.	general
Pain or stiffness in the hip, groin, thigh or knee Limited range of motion of the hip joint Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually involves just one hip.	general
Both hips are affected in some children, usually at different times.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if your child begins limping or complains of hip, groin or knee pain.	general
If your child has a fever or can't bear weight on the leg, seek emergency medical care.	general
Legg-Calve-Perthes disease occurs when too little blood is supplied to the ball portion of the hip joint (femoral head).	general
Without an adequate blood supply, this bone becomes unstable, and it may break easily and heal poorly.	general
The underlying cause of the temporary reduction in blood flow to the femoral head is still unknown.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease include: Although Legg-Calve-Perthes disease can affect children of nearly any age, it most commonly begins between ages 4 and 8.	general
Legg-Calve-Perthes is up to five times more common in boys than in girls.	general
Your child's sex.	general
White children are more likely to develop the disorder than are black children.	general
In a small number of cases, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease appears to be linked to mutations in certain genes.	general
Genetic mutations.	general
Complications Children who have had Legg-Calve-Perthes disease are at higher risk of developing hip arthritis in adulthood ‚Äî particularly if the hip joint heals in an abnormal shape.	general
If the hip bones don't fit together well after healing, the joint can wear out early.	general
In general, children who are diagnosed with Legg-Calve-Perthes after age 6 are more likely to develop hip problems later in life.	general
The younger the child is at the time of diagnosis, the better the chances for the hip joint to heal in a normal, round shape.	general
Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia ‚Äî lung inflammation usually caused by infection.	general
It's caused by a bacterium known as legionella.	general
Most people catch Legionnaires' disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil.	general
Older adults, smokers and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to Legionnaires' disease.	general
The legionella bacterium also causes Pontiac fever, a milder illness resembling the flu.	general
Pontiac fever usually clears on its own, but untreated Legionnaires' disease can be fatal.	general
Although prompt treatment with antibiotics usually cures Legionnaires' disease, some people continue to have problems after treatment.	general
Legionnaires' disease usually develops two to 10 days after exposure to legionella bacteria.	general
It frequently begins with the following signs and symptoms: Fever that may be 104 F (40 C) or higher By the second or third day, you'll develop other signs and symptoms that can include: Cough, which might bring up mucus and sometimes blood Shortness of breath Confusion or other mental changes Although Legionnaires' disease primarily affects the lungs, it occasionally can cause infections in wounds and in other parts of the body, including the heart.	general
A mild form of Legionnaires' disease ‚Äî known as Pontiac fever ‚Äî can produce fever, chills, headache and muscle aches.	general
Pontiac fever doesn't infect your lungs, and symptoms usually clear within two to five days.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you think you've been exposed to legionella bacteria.	general
Diagnosing and treating Legionnaires' disease as soon as possible can help shorten the recovery period and prevent serious complications.	general
For people at high risk, such as smokers or older adults, prompt treatment is critical.	general
The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is responsible for most cases of Legionnaires' disease.	general
Outdoors, legionella bacteria survive in soil and water, but rarely cause infections.	general
However, legionella bacteria can multiply in water systems made by humans, such as air conditioners.	general
Although it's possible to get Legionnaires' disease from home plumbing, most outbreaks have occurred in large buildings, perhaps because complex systems allow the bacteria to grow and spread more easily.	general
Also, home and car air conditioning units don't use water for cooling.	general
How the infection spreads Most people become infected when they inhale microscopic water droplets containing legionella bacteria.	general
This might be from the spray from a shower, faucet or whirlpool, or water from the ventilation system in a large building.	general
Outbreaks have been linked to: Hot tubs and whirlpools Hot water tanks and heaters Decorative fountains Swimming pools Birthing pools Drinking water Besides by breathing in water droplets, the infection can be transmitted in other ways, including: This occurs when liquids accidentally enter your lungs, usually because you cough or choke while drinking.	general
If you aspirate water containing legionella bacteria, you can develop Legionnaires' disease.	general
Aspiration.	general
A few people have contracted Legionnaires' disease after working in a garden or using contaminated potting soil.	general
Risk factors Not everyone exposed to legionella bacteria becomes sick.	general
You're more likely to develop the infection if you: Smoking damages the lungs, making you more susceptible to all types of lung infections.	general
This can be a result of / or certain medications, especially corticosteroids and drugs taken to prevent organ rejection after a transplant.	general
Have a weakened immune system.	general
This includes emphysema, diabetes, kidney disease or cancer.	general
Have a chronic lung disease or other serious condition.	general
Are 50 years of age Legionnaires' disease can be a problem in hospitals and nursing homes, where germs can spread easily and people are vulnerable to infection.	general
Complications Legionnaires' disease can lead to a number of life-threatening complications, including: This occurs when the lungs can't provide the body with enough oxygen or can't remove enough carbon dioxide from the blood.	general
Respiratory failure.	general
This occurs when a severe, sudden drop in blood pressure reduces blood flow to vital organs, especially to the kidneys and brain.	general
The heart tries to compensate by increasing the volume of blood pumped, but the extra workload eventually weakens the heart and reduces blood flow even further.	general
Septic shock.	general
This is the sudden loss of your kidneys' ability to filter waste from your blood.	general
When your kidneys fail, dangerous levels of fluid and waste accumulate in your body.	general
Acute kidney failure.	general
When not treated promptly, Legionnaires' disease can be fatal.	general
Outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease are preventable, but prevention requires water management systems in buildings that ensure that water is monitored and cleaned regularly.	general
To lower your personal risk, avoid smoking.	general
Leiomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that affects smooth muscle tissue.	general
These tumors are most common in the abdomen, but can occur anywhere in the body, including the uterus.	general
Other common sites include blood vessels and skin.	general
Abdominal leiomyosarcoma tumors can measure over 4 inches (10 centimeters) across and may be accompanied by pain, weight loss, nausea or vomiting.	general
Leiomyosarcoma also can affect large blood vessels, particularly the vein that carries blood from the lower part of the body back to the heart (inferior vena cava) and the artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary artery).	general
Leiomyosarcoma can be mistaken for many other types of tumors and benign growths, including uterine fibroids (leiomyomas).	general
In fact, most of the leiomyosarcomas that occur in the uterus are presumed to be fibroids because that's what they look like on imaging tests.	general
The truth is revealed only after a pathologist examines the tissue after a hysterectomy.	general
Surgical removal is the mainstay of treatment for leiomyosarcoma, regardless of the location of the tumor in the body.	general
In the past, a device called a morcellator was often used to grind the uterus into smaller pieces to aid in the removal of tissue during hysterectomies performed with scopes through small incisions.	general
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now recommends that most women, especially those past menopause, avoid morcellation of the uterus or fibroids because the procedure may increase the risk of spreading cancer if a previously undiagnosed cancerous mass is morcellated.	general
About a third of the leiomyosarcomas that occur in the uterus have already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.	general
While chemotherapy and radiation is generally not used in early-stage uterine leiomyosarcoma, they are used to treat the tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.	general
Leukoplakia Leukoplakia Leukoplakia appears as thick, white patches on the inside surfaces of your mouth.	general
It has a number of possible causes, including repeated injury or irritation.	general
It can also be a sign of precancerous changes in the mouth or mouth cancer.	general
With leukoplakia (loo-koh-PLAY-key-uh), thickened, white patches form on your gums, the insides of your cheeks, the bottom of your mouth and, sometimes, your tongue.	general
These patches can't be scraped off.	general
Doctors don't know what causes leukoplakia but consider chronic irritation from tobacco ‚Äî whether smoked, dipped or chewed ‚Äî to be the main culprit in its development.	general
Most leukoplakia patches are noncancerous (benign), though some show early signs of cancer.	general
Cancers on the bottom of the mouth can occur next to areas of leukoplakia.	general
And white areas mixed in with red areas (speckled leukoplakia) may indicate the potential for cancer.	general
So it's best to see your dentist or primary care professional if you have unusual, persistent changes in your mouth.	general
A type of leukoplakia called hairy leukoplakia, sometimes called oral hairy leukoplakia, primarily affects people whose immune systems have been weakened by disease, especially HIV/AIDS.	general
Leukoplakia usually occurs on your gums, the insides of your cheeks, the bottom of your mouth ‚Äî beneath the tongue ‚Äî and, sometimes, your tongue.	general
It isn't usually painful and may go unnoticed for a while.	general
Leukoplakia may appear: White or grayish in patches that can't be wiped away Irregular or flat-textured Along with raised, red lesions (speckled leukoplakia or erythroplakia), which are more likely to show precancerous changes Hairy leukoplakia Hairy leukoplakia causes fuzzy, white patches that resemble folds or ridges, usually on the sides of your tongue.	general
It's often mistaken for oral thrush, an infection marked by creamy white patches that can be wiped away, which is also common in people with a weakened immune system.	general
When to see a doctor Even though leukoplakia doesn't usually cause discomfort, sometimes it can indicate a more serious condition.	general
See your dentist or primary care professional if you have any of the following: White plaques or sores in your mouth that don't heal on their own within two weeks Lumps or white, red or dark patches in your mouth Persistent changes in the tissues of your mouth Ear pain when swallowing Although the cause of leukoplakia is unknown, chronic irritation, such as from tobacco use, including smoking and chewing, appears to be responsible for most cases.	general
Often, regular users of smokeless tobacco products eventually develop leukoplakia where they hold the tobacco against their cheeks.	general
Other causes may include chronic irritation from: Jagged, broken or sharp teeth rubbing on tongue surfaces Broken or ill-fitting dentures Long-term alcohol use Your dentist can talk with you about what may be causing leukoplakia in your case.	general
Hairy leukoplakia Hairy leukoplakia results from infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).	general
Once you've been infected with EBV, the virus remains in your body for life.	general
Normally, the virus is dormant, but if your immune system is weakened, especially from HIV/AIDS, the virus can become reactivated, leading to conditions such as hairy leukoplakia.	general
Risk factors Tobacco use, particularly smokeless tobacco, puts you at high risk of leukoplakia and oral cancer.	general
Long-term alcohol use increases your risk, and drinking alcohol combined with smoking increases your risk even more.	general
Hairy leukoplakia People with HIV/AIDS are especially likely to develop hairy leukoplakia.	general
Although the use of antiretroviral drugs has reduced the number of cases, hairy leukoplakia still affects a number of HIV-positive people, and it may be one of the first signs of HIV infection.	general
Complications Leukoplakia usually doesn't cause permanent damage to tissues in your mouth.	general
However, leukoplakia increases your risk of oral cancer.	general
Oral cancers often form near leukoplakia patches, and the patches themselves may show cancerous changes.	general
Even after leukoplakia patches are removed, the risk of oral cancer remains.	general
Hairy leukoplakia Hairy leukoplakia isn't likely to lead to cancer.	general
But it may indicate HIV/AIDS.	general
You may be able to prevent leukoplakia if you avoid all tobacco products or alcohol use.	general
Talk to your doctor about methods to help you quit.	general
If you continue to smoke or chew tobacco or drink alcohol, have frequent dental checkups.	general
Oral cancers are usually painless until fairly advanced, so quitting tobacco and alcohol is a better prevention strategy.	general
Hairy leukoplakia If you have a weakened immune system, you may not be able to prevent hairy leukoplakia, but identifying it early can help you receive appropriate treatment.	general
Head lice occur on the scalp and are easiest to see at the nape of the neck and over the ears.	general
Small nits (eggs) resembling tiny pussy willow buds about the size of dandruff flakes are visible on hair shafts.	general
Lice are tiny, wingless, parasitic insects that feed on your blood.	general
Lice are easily spread ‚Äî especially by schoolchildren ‚Äî through close personal contact and by sharing belongings.	general
There are three types of lice: These lice are found on your scalp.	general
They're easiest to see at the nape of your neck and over your ears.	general
These lice live in clothing and on bedding and move onto your skin to feed.	general
Body lice most often affect people who aren't able to bathe or launder clothing regularly, such as homeless or transient individuals.	general
Commonly called crabs, these lice occur on the skin and hair of your pubic area and, less frequently, on coarse body hair, such as chest hair, eyebrows or eyelashes.	general
Pubic lice.	general
People can have good personal hygiene and still get lice.	general
Unless treated properly, this condition can become a recurring problem.	general
Head lice feed on blood from the scalp.	general
The female louse lays eggs (nits) that stick to hair shafts.	general
Signs and symptoms of lice include: Intense itching.	general
Tickling feeling from movement of hair.	general
Lice on your scalp, body, clothing, or pubic or other body hair.	general
Adult lice may be about the size of a sesame seed or slightly larger.	general
Lice eggs (nits) on hair shafts.	general
Nits resemble tiny pussy willow buds.	general
Nits can be mistaken for dandruff, but unlike dandruff, they can't be easily brushed out of hair.	general
Small red bumps on the scalp, neck and shoulders.	general
When to see a doctor Usually you can get rid of lice by taking self-care steps that include using nonprescription shampoo that's specifically formulated to kill lice.	general
However, see your doctor if: Nonprescription shampoo doesn't kill the lice ‚Äî your doctor can prescribe a stronger, prescription shampoo You're pregnant ‚Äî don't use any anti-lice shampoo until you talk to your doctor You have any infected hives or skin abrasions from scratching You can get lice by coming into contact with either lice or their eggs.	general
Eggs hatch in about one week.	general
Lice can't fly or walk on the ground.	general
They spread through: This may occur as children or family members play or interact closely.	general
Head-to-head or body-to-body contact.	general
Storing infested clothing in closets, in lockers or on side-by-side hooks at school, or storing personal items such as pillows, blankets, combs and stuffed toys in proximity at home can permit lice to spread.	general
Proximity of stored belongings.	general
These may include clothing, headphones, brushes, combs, hair decorations, towels, blankets, pillows and stuffed toys.	general
Items shared among friends or family members.	general
Lying on a bed or sitting in overstuffed, cloth-covered furniture recently used by someone with lice can spread them.	general
Lice can live for one to two days off the body.	general
Contact with contaminated furniture.	general
Pubic lice usually spread through sexual contact and most commonly affect adults.	general
Pubic lice found on children may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse.	general
Sexual contact.	general
It's difficult to prevent the spread of head lice among children in child care and school settings.	general
There's so much close contact among children and their belongings that lice can spread easily.	general
It's no reflection on your hygiene habits or those of your children, and it's not a failure on your part as a parent if your child gets head lice.	general
Some over-the-counter products claim to repel lice, but more scientific research is needed to prove their safety and effectiveness.	general
A number of small studies have shown that ingredients in some of these products ‚Äî mostly plant oils such as coconut, olive, rosemary and tea tree ‚Äî may work to repel lice.	general
"However, these products are classified as ""natural"" so they aren't regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and their safety and effectiveness haven't been tested to FDA standards."	general
Until more research proves the effectiveness of head lice prevention products, the best approach is simply to take thorough steps to get rid of the lice ‚Äî and their eggs ‚Äî so that you don't have more lice to deal with.	general
with classmates during play and other activities.	general
Ask your child to avoid head-to-head contact such as hats, scarves, coats, combs, brushes, hair accessories and headphones.	general
Instruct your child not to share personal belongings where hats and clothing from more than one student are hung on a common hook or kept in a locker.	general
Instruct your child to avoid shared spaces However, it's not realistic to expect that you and your child can eliminate all the types of contact that may result in the spread of lice.	general
Your child may have nits in his or her hair but not necessarily develop a case of head lice.	general
Some nits are empty eggs.	general
However, nits that are found within 1/4 inch (6.	general
4 millimeters) of the scalp should be treated ‚Äî even if you find only one ‚Äî to prevent the possibility of hatching.	general
Nits that are farther away from the scalp are probably from an old infestation, but should be removed to prevent a recurrence.	general
Lichen nitidus Lichen nitidus Lichen nitidus is an uncommon, inflammatory skin condition.	general
It appears as small, skin-colored, raised bumps (papules).	general
Lichen nitidus (LIE-kun ni-TIE-dus) is a rare skin condition that usually appears as tiny, skin-colored, glistening bumps on the surface of your skin.	general
Lichen nitidus results from abnormal inflammatory activity in skin cells, but the cause of inflammation is unknown.	general
Although lichen nitidus may affect anyone, it typically develops in children and young adults.	general
Lichen nitidus rarely causes discomfort and usually clears up on its own without treatment.	general
Lichen nitidus doesn't increase your risk of skin cancer, and it isn't an infectious disease that can spread to other people.	general
Lichen nitidus appears as clusters of tiny, glistening bumps (papules).	general
Characteristics of the bumps include the following: The bumps range in size from pinpoint to pinhead size.	general
They areflat topped and round.	general
Bumps are usually the same color as your skin.	general
They may be slightly pink on people with lighter skin, or lighter than normal skin color on people with darker skin.	general
Lichen nitidus bumps commonly occur on the chest, abdomen, arms and genital areas, including the penis.	general
They rarely occur on the palms, soles of the feet or fingernails.	general
Lichen nitidus may clear up at one site on your body but then appear at another.	general
In rare cases, the bumps of lichen nitidus may itch, sometimes intensely.	general
They may appear in a line where there's a scratch, crease or constant pressure on the skin, such as a fold of skin on the abdomen or the crease of skin on the inside of the elbow or wrist.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if tiny bumps or a rash-like condition appears on your skin for no apparent reason, such as a known allergic reaction or contact with poison ivy.	general
Because a number of conditions can cause skin reactions, it's best to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis.	general
Get immediate care if your skin condition is accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as: The cause of lichen nitidus is unknown.	general
The papules that appear are the result of inflammation controlled by white blood cells called T lymphocytes.	general
Normally, these cells work to heal disease or injury, such as a cut on your finger.	general
Doctors and researchers don't know what prompts T lymphocytes to be activated in lichen nitidus.	general
Risk factors Lichen nitidus seems to be more likely to develop in children and young adults.	general
Association with other diseases Because lichen nitidus is rare, most information about the disorder is known from individual cases or small studies.	general
Links between lichen nitidus and other diseases aren't well-understood, but they may include: an inflammatory condition usually characterized by patches of red or purple, flat-topped, itchy bumps on the skin or lacy white patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth Lichen planus, an inflammatory skin condition usually characterized by dry, itchy rashes on the face, inside the elbow, behind the knees, and on the hands and feet Atopic dermatitis (eczema), inflammation of the lining of your digestive tract, which can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea and malnutrition Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease that causes persistent joint pain, swelling and stiffness Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, an infectious disease that most often affects the lungs Tuberculosis, Complications Lichen nitidus is a harmless condition that doesn't result in long-term skin problems or medical complications.	general
However, the appearance of lichen nitidus may cause a person to be self-conscious or embarrassed.	general
Lichen planus Lichen planus Lichen planus is an inflammatory disorder that appears as purplish, flat-topped bumps when it affects the skin.	general
Bumps may appear in clusters or lines.	general
Lichen planus of nails Lichen planus of nails When it affects the nails, lichen planus causes thinning, ridging and splitting.	general
Some people experience permanent nail loss.	general
Oral lichen planus Oral lichen planus This white lacelike patch on the interior surface of the cheek is typical for oral lichen planus.	general
Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is a condition that can cause swelling and irritation in the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes.	general
On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, itchy, flat bumps that develop over several weeks.	general
In the mouth, vagina and other areas covered by a mucous membrane, lichen planus forms lacy white patches, sometimes with painful sores.	general
Most people can manage typical, mild cases of lichen planus at home, without medical care.	general
If the condition causes pain or significant itching, you may need prescription drugs.	general
Lichen planus isn't contagious.	general
The signs and symptoms of lichen planus vary depending on the areas affected.	general
Typical signs and symptoms are: Purplish, flat bumps, most often on the inner forearm, wrist or ankle, and sometimes the genitals Blisters that break to form scabs or crusts Lacy white patches in the mouth or on the lips or tongue Painful sores in the mouth or vagina When to see a doctor See your doctor if tiny bumps or a rash-like condition appears on your skin for no apparent reason, such as a known allergic reaction or contact with poison ivy.	general
Also see your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms associated with lichen planus of the mouth, genitals, scalp or nails.	general
It's best to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis because a number of skin and mucosal conditions can cause lesions and discomfort.	general
Lichen planus occurs when your immune system attacks cells of the skin or mucous membranes.	general
It's not clear why this abnormal immune response happens.	general
The condition isn't contagious.	general
Lichen planus can be triggered by: Hepatitis C infection Certain pigments, chemicals and metals Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others) Certain medications for heart disease, high blood pressure or arthritis Risk factors Anyone can develop lichen planus.	general
But the condition most often affects middle-aged adults.	general
Oral lichen planus most often affects middle-aged women.	general
Complications Lichen planus can be difficult to manage on the vulva and in the vagina, causing severe pain and sometimes leaving scars.	general
Sexual dysfunction can become a long-term complication.	general
Oral sores may affect your ability to eat.	general
The affected skin might stay slightly darker even after the rash clears up, especially in dark-skinned people.	general
Oral lichen planus increases the risk of oral cancer.	general
Left untreated, lichen planus of the ear canal may lead to hearing loss.	general

Oral lichen planus Oral lichen planus This white lacelike patch on the interior surface of the cheek is typical for oral lichen planus.	general
Oral lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an ongoing (chronic) inflammatory condition that affects mucous membranes inside your mouth.	general
Oral lichen planus may appear as white, lacy patches; red, swollen tissues; or open sores.	general
These lesions may cause burning, pain or other discomfort.	general
Oral lichen planus can't be passed from one person to another.	general
The disorder occurs when the immune system mounts an attack against cells of the oral mucous membranes for unknown reasons.	general
Symptoms can usually be managed, but people who have oral lichen planus need regular monitoring because they may be at risk of developing mouth cancer in the affected areas.	general
Signs and symptoms of oral lichen planus affect the mucous membranes of the mouth.	general
Lacy, white, raised patches of tissues Red, swollen, tender patches of tissues Inside of the cheeks, the most common location Pain or discomfort The white, lacy patches may not cause discomfort when they appear on the inside of the cheeks.	general
However, symptoms accompanying red, swollen patches and open sores may include: Burning sensation or pain Bleeding and irritation with tooth brushing Inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) Painful, thickened patches on the tongue Discomfort when speaking, chewing or swallowing Other types of lichen planus If you have oral lichen planus, you may have lichen planus lesions affecting other parts of your body.	general
Lesions usually appear as purplish, flat-topped bumps that are often itchy.	general
Lesions on the female genitalia often cause pain or burning and discomfort with intercourse.	general
The lesions are usually red and eroded and occasionally appear as white areas.	general
Lesions can also occur on male genitalia.	general
Lichen planus of the ears can lead to hearing loss.	general
When skin lesions appear on the scalp, they may cause temporary or permanent hair loss.	general
Though rare, lichen planus of the toenails or fingernails may result in ridges on the nails, thinning or splitting of nails, and temporary or permanent nail loss.	general
Rarely, lichen planus may involve the mucous membrane surfaces of the eyes, and can cause scarring and blindness.	general
Lichen planus of the esophagus is rare, but when it occurs, it may result in a narrowing of the esophagus or the formation of tightened, ringlike bands in the esophagus that can make swallowing difficult.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor or dentist if you have any signs or symptoms listed above.	general
It's not known what causes oral lichen planus.	general
However, T lymphocytes ‚Äî certain white blood cells involved in inflammation ‚Äî appear to be activated in oral lichen planus.	general
This could indicate an immune disorder, and genetic factors may be involved.	general
But more research is needed to determine the exact cause.	general
It's possible that, in some people, oral lichen planus may be triggered by certain medications, mouth injury, infection or allergy-causing agents such as dental materials.	general
Stress may be involved in symptoms becoming worse or recurring.	general
However, these causes are not confirmed.	general
Risk factors Anyone can develop oral lichen planus, but it's more common in middle-aged women.	general
Some factors may increase your risk of developing oral lichen planus, such as having a disorder that lowers your immunity or taking certain medications, though more research is needed.	general
Lichen sclerosus (LIE-kun skluh-ROW-sus) is an uncommon condition that creates patchy, white skin that appears thinner than normal.	general
It usually affects the genital and anal areas.	general
Anyone can get lichen sclerosus but postmenopausal women are at higher risk.	general
Your doctor can suggest treatment with creams or ointments that help return a more normal appearance to your skin and decrease the tendency for scarring.	general
The condition does tend to recur, so long-term follow-up care may be needed.	general
Rarely, lichen sclerosus improves without treatment.	general
Lichen sclerosus Lichen sclerosus Lichen sclerosus is a rare skin condition characterized by white, blotchy patches of skin.	general
Lichen sclerosus in genital area Lichen sclerosus in genital area Lichen sclerosus may affect skin on any part of your body, but most often involves the skin of the vulva, foreskin of the penis or skin in the anal area.	general
People with mild lichen sclerosus may have no signs or symptoms.	general
Signs and symptoms usually affect the skin of the genital and anal areas, but may also affect the skin of the upper body, upper arms and breasts.	general
They may include: Discomfort or pain Blotchy, wrinkled patches Tearing or bleeding Painful sex When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms common to lichen sclerosus.	general
If you've already been diagnosed with lichen sclerosus, see your doctor every six to 12 months to be checked for any skin changes or treatment side effects.	general
The cause of lichen sclerosus is unknown.	general
An overactive immune system or an imbalance of hormones may play a role.	general
Previous skin damage at a particular site on your skin may increase the likelihood of lichen sclerosus at that location.	general
Lichen sclerosus isn't contagious and cannot be spread through sexual intercourse.	general
Lichen sclerosus often occurs in postmenopausal women, but also in men and children.	general
In women, lichen sclerosus usually involves the vulva.	general
In boys and men, uncircumcised males are most at risk, because the condition generally affects the foreskin.	general
In children, the signs and symptoms may improve at puberty, but they will still need monitoring for disease activity.	general
Risk factors The risk of lichen sclerosus is higher for postmenopausal women, although it can occur in men and children.	general
Men who are uncircumcised have a higher risk because the condition often affects the foreskin.	general
Complications Complications of lichen sclerosus include painful sex, urinary retention, constipation and an inability to retract the foreskin.	general
People with lichen sclerosus are also at an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the affected area.	general
"Limited scleroderma, also known as CREST syndrome, is one subtype of scleroderma ‚Äî a condition whose name means ""hardened skin""."	general
The skin changes associated with limited scleroderma typically occur only in the lower arms and legs, below the elbows and knees, and sometimes affect the face and neck.	general
Limited scleroderma can also affect your digestive tract, heart, lungs or kidneys.	general
The problems caused by limited scleroderma may be minor.	general
Sometimes, however, the disease affects the lungs or heart, with potentially serious results.	general
Limited scleroderma has no known cure.	general
Treatments focus on managing symptoms, preventing serious complications and improving quality of life.	general
Limited scleroderma Limited scleroderma In limited scleroderma, dry ulcers can develop on fingers and toes.	general
The skin can become taut and shiny.	general
Also, dilated blood vessels can collect on the surface of the skin.	general
Raynaud's disease Raynaud's disease Raynaud's disease is a vascular disorder that causes intermittent interruption of blood flow to the extremities.	general
The affected body part may turn white or blue and feel cold and numb until circulation improves.	general
Telangiectasia Telangiectasia Telangiectasias are permanently dilated small blood vessels.	general
They can develop externally in the skin and may appear as a group of red lines.	general
While some varieties of scleroderma occur rapidly, signs and symptoms of limited scleroderma usually develop gradually.	general
They include: In limited scleroderma, skin changes typically affect only the lower arms and legs, including fingers and toes, and sometimes the face and neck.	general
Skin can look shiny from being pulled taut over underlying bone.	general
It may become difficult to bend your fingers or to open your mouth.	general
Tight, hardened skin.	general
This condition occurs when small blood vessels in your fingers and toes spasm in response to cold or emotional stress, blocking the flow of blood.	general
In most people, the skin turns white before becoming blue, cold and numb.	general
Raynaud's phenomena.	general
When circulation improves, the skin usually reddens and might throb or tingle.	general
Raynaud's phenomena is often the first sign of limited scleroderma, but many people who have Raynaud's never develop scleroderma.	general
The swelling of tiny blood vessels near the skin's surface cause these small red spots or lines (telangiectasias).	general
Not painful, they occur primarily on the hands and face.	general
Red spots or lines on skin.	general
Limited scleroderma can cause tiny calcium deposits (calcinosis) to develop under your skin, mainly on your elbows, knees and fingers.	general
You can see and feel these deposits, which sometimes are tender or become infected.	general
Bumps under the skin.	general
Limited scleroderma commonly causes problems with the tube that connects the mouth and stomach (esophagus).	general
Poor functioning of the muscles in the upper and lower esophagus can make swallowing difficult and allow stomach acids to back up into the esophagus, leading to heartburn, inflammation and scarring of esophageal tissues.	general
Swallowing difficulties.	general
When to see a doctor Early detection of limited scleroderma can help prevent serious complications.	general
See your doctor if you have any indications of the condition.	general
The cause isn't known, but limited scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disorder, in which your immune system turns against your body.	general
The immune system appears to stimulate the production of too much collagen, a key component of connective tissue.	general
This overproduction of collagen builds up in the skin and internal organs so that they don't function normally.	general
Risk factors Women are far more likely to develop limited scleroderma than men are.	general
Limited scleroderma is more common between the ages of 30 and 50.	general
In the United States, limited scleroderma tends to be more severe in blacks and Native Americans than in whites.	general
If someone in your family has an autoimmune disease ‚Äî such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Hashimoto's disease ‚Äî you have an increased risk of developing limited scleroderma.	general
Genetic factors.	general
Certain toxic substances ‚Äî such as polyvinyl chloride, benzene, silica and trichloroethylene ‚Äî might trigger scleroderma in people with a genetic predisposition to the disease.	general
Exposure to toxins.	general
Complications The visible signs of limited scleroderma ‚Äî tight, thick skin on your fingers, hands and face ‚Äî can change your appearance; make everyday tasks, such as opening a jar or shaving, more difficult; and affect your speech.	general
But the most serious complications tend to occur beneath your skin.	general
Changes in the functioning of esophageal muscles can cause difficulty swallowing and chronic heartburn.	general
When limited scleroderma affects your intestine, it can cause constipation, diarrhea, bloating after meals, unintended weight loss and malnutrition.	general
Gastrointestinal problems.	general
Severe Raynaud's phenomena can obstruct blood flow to your fingers and toes, causing ulcers that can be difficult to heal.	general
Also, abnormal or narrowed blood vessels combined with severe Raynaud's phenomena can lead to gangrene of fingers or toes, which might require amputation.	general
Ulcers on fingers and toes.	general
Limited scleroderma can cause a variety of problems with your lungs.	general
In some cases, excess collagen collects in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs, making the lung tissue stiffer and less able to work properly.	general
Lung damage.	general
Increased blood pressure in the arteries between your heart and lungs makes the heart work harder and eventually weakens it.	general
Scarring of heart tissue can lead to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) and, in rare cases, to an inflamed heart muscle (myocarditis).	general
Heart problems.	general
Although kidney damage is more common in other forms of scleroderma, it can occur in limited scleroderma.	general
The first indication might be high blood pressure.	general
Restricted blood flow to the kidneys can result in renal crises, which, if untreated, can lead to kidney failure.	general
Kidney problems.	general
Severe tightening of facial skin can make it difficult to open your mouth wide enough to brush your teeth.	general
Acid reflux can destroy tooth enamel, and changes in gum tissue may cause your teeth to become loose or even fall out.	general
Dental problems.	general
Limited scleroderma can cause very dry eyes and mouth.	general
Dry eyes and mouth.	general
Lip cancer may appear as a sore on your lip that doesn't heal.	general
Lip cancer occurs on the skin of the lips.	general
Lip cancer can occur anywhere along the upper or lower lip, but is most common on the lower lip.	general
Lip cancer is considered a type of mouth (oral) cancer.	general
Most lip cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which means they begin in the thin, flat cells in the middle and outer layers of the skin called squamous cells.	general
Lip cancer risk factors include excessive sun exposure and tobacco use.	general
You may reduce your risk of lip cancer by protecting your face from the sun with a hat or sunblock, and by quitting smoking.	general
Treatment for lip cancer usually involves surgery to remove the cancer.	general
For small lip cancers, surgery may be a minor procedure with minimal impact on your appearance.	general
For larger lip cancers, more extensive surgery may be necessary.	general
Careful planning and reconstruction can preserve your ability to eat and speak normally, and also achieve a satisfactory appearance after surgery.	general
A flat or slightly raised whitish discoloration of the lip A sore on your lip that won't heal Tingling, pain or numbness of the lips or the skin around the mouth When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
It's not clear what causes lip cancer.	general
In general, cancer starts when cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA.	general
A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do.	general
The changes tell the cell to begin multiplying uncontrollably and to continue living when healthy cells would die.	general
The accumulating cells form a tumor that can invade and destroy normal body tissue.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of lip cancer include: Tobacco use of any kind, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff, among others A weakened immune system To reduce your risk of lip cancer, you can: If you use tobacco, stop.	general
If you don't use tobacco, don't start.	general
Using tobacco, whether smoked or chewed, exposes the cells in your lips to dangerous cancer-causing chemicals.	general
Stop using tobacco or don't start.	general
For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy.	general
Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.	general
Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours ‚Äî or more often if you're swimming or perspiring.	general
Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days.	general
Tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of lip cancer.	general
Avoid tanning beds.	general
A lipoma is a fatty tumor located just below the skin.	general
It isn't cancer and is usually harmless.	general
A lipoma is a slow-growing, fatty lump that's most often situated between your skin and the underlying muscle layer.	general
A lipoma, which feels doughy and usually isn't tender, moves readily with slight finger pressure.	general
Lipomas are usually detected in middle age.	general
Some people have more than one lipoma.	general
A lipoma isn't cancer and usually is harmless.	general
Treatment generally isn't necessary, but if the lipoma bothers you, is painful or is growing, you may want to have it removed.	general
Lipomas can occur anywhere in the body.	general
They are typically: They commonly occur in the neck, shoulders, back, abdomen, arms and thighs.	general
Situated just under the skin.	general
They also move easily with slight finger pressure.	general
Soft and doughy to the touch.	general
Lipomas are typically less than 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter, but they can grow.	general
Generally small.	general
Lipomas can be painful if they grow and press on nearby nerves or if they contain many blood vessels.	general
Sometimes painful.	general
When to see a doctor A lipoma is rarely a serious medical condition.	general
But if you notice a lump or swelling anywhere on your body, have it checked by your doctor.	general
The cause of lipomas isn't fully understood.	general
They tend to run in families, so genetic factors likely play a role in their development.	general
Risk factors Several factors may increase your risk of developing a lipoma, including: Although lipomas can occur at any age, they're most common in this age group.	general
Being between 40 and 60 years old.	general
Lipomas tend to run in families.	general
Liposarcoma Liposarcoma Liposarcoma is a type of cancer that occurs in fat cells in the body, most often in the muscles of the limbs or the abdomen.	general
Liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in the fat cells.	general
Liposarcoma is considered a type of soft tissue sarcoma.	general
Liposarcoma can occur in fat cells in any part of the body, but most cases occur in the muscles of the limbs or in the abdomen.	general
Liposarcoma occurs most often in older adults, though it can occur at any age.	general
Treatment for liposarcoma typically involves surgery to remove the cancer.	general
Other treatments, such as radiation therapy, also may be used.	general
Liposarcoma signs and symptoms vary depending on the part of the body where the cancer forms.	general
Liposarcoma that forms in the arms and legs can cause: A growing lump of tissue under your skin Liposarcoma that forms in the abdomen can cause: Abdominal pain Abdominal swelling Constipation When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
It's not clear what causes liposarcoma.	general
Doctors know that liposarcoma forms when a fat cell develops errors (mutations) in its genetic code.	general
The mutations tell the cell to multiply rapidly and to go on living when other cells would die.	general
The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor).	general
Several types of liposarcoma exist.	general
Some grow slowly and the cells stay in one area of the body.	general
Other types grow very quickly and may spread to other areas of the body.	general
Listeria infection is a foodborne bacterial illness that can be very serious for pregnant women and people with impaired immune systems.	general
Listeria infection is most commonly contracted by eating improperly processed deli meats and unpasteurized milk products.	general
Healthy people rarely become ill from listeria infection, but the disease can be fatal to unborn babies and newborns.	general
People who have weakened immune systems also are at higher risk of life-threatening complications.	general
Prompt antibiotic treatment can help curb the effects of listeria infection.	general
Listeria bacteria can survive refrigeration and even freezing.	general
That's why people who are at higher risk of serious infections should avoid eating the types of food most likely to contain listeria bacteria.	general
Symptoms may begin a few days after you've eaten contaminated food, but it may take as long as 30 days or more before the first signs and symptoms of infection begin.	general
If the listeria infection spreads to your nervous system, signs and symptoms may include: Loss of balance Symptoms during pregnancy and for newborns During pregnancy, a listeria infection is likely to cause only mild signs and symptoms in the mother.	general
The consequences for the baby, however, may be devastating.	general
The baby may die unexpectedly before birth or experience a life-threatening infection within the first few days after birth.	general
As in adults, the signs and symptoms of a listeria infection in a newborn can be subtle, but may include: Little interest in feeding When to see a doctor If you've eaten a food that's been recalled because of a listeria outbreak, pay close attention to any possible signs or symptoms of illness.	general
If you experience fever, muscle aches, nausea or diarrhea, contact your doctor.	general
The same goes for illness after eating a potentially contaminated product, such as foods made with unpasteurized milk or poorly heated hot dogs or deli meats.	general
If you experience a high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, confusion or sensitivity to light, seek emergency care.	general
These signs and symptoms may indicate bacterial meningitis, a life-threatening complication of a listeria infection.	general
Listeria bacteria can be found in soil, water and animal feces.	general
Humans typically are infected by consuming: Raw vegetables that have been contaminated from the soil or from contaminated manure used as fertilizer Contaminated animal meat Unpasteurized milk or foods made with unpasteurized milk Certain processed foods ‚Äî such as soft cheeses, hot dogs and deli meats that have been contaminated after processing Unborn babies can contract a listeria infection from the mother via the placenta.	general
Risk factors Pregnant women and people who have weak immune systems are at highest risk of contracting a listeria infection.	general
Pregnant women and their babies Pregnant women are significantly more susceptible to listeria infections than are other healthy adults.	general
Although a listeria infection may cause only a mild illness in the mother, consequences for the baby may include: Miscarriage This category includes people who: Are older than 60 Take high-dose prednisone or certain rheumatoid arthritis drugs Take medications to block rejection of a transplanted organ Complications Most listeria infections are so mild they may go unnoticed.	general
However, in some cases, a listeria infection can lead to life-threatening complications ‚Äî including: A generalized blood infection (septicemia) Inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain (meningitis) Complications of a listeria infection may be most severe for an unborn baby.	general
Early in pregnancy, a listeria infection may lead to miscarriage.	general
Later in pregnancy, a listeria infection may lead to stillbirth, premature birth or a potentially fatal infection in the baby after birth ‚Äî even if the mother becomes only mildly ill.	general
To prevent a listeria infection, follow simple food safety guidelines: Wash your hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water before and after handling or preparing food.	general
After cooking, use hot, soapy water to wash the utensils, cutting board and other food preparation surfaces.	general
Keep things clean.	general
Clean raw vegetables with a scrub brush or vegetable brush under plenty of running water.	general
Scrub raw vegetables.	general
Use a food thermometer to make sure your meat, poultry and egg dishes are cooked to a safe temperature.	general
Cook your food thoroughly.	general
Precautions for people particularly at risk If you're at risk of a listeria infection ‚Äî you're pregnant or you have a weak immune system ‚Äî you may want to be particularly cautious about listeria.	general
Take additional precautions with these types of foods: Don't eat soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, blue cheese or Mexican-style cheeses such as queso blanco and queso fresco, unless it's clear from the packaging that the product was made using pasteurized milk.	general
Soft cheeses and Mexican-style cheeses.	general
Avoid hot dogs, luncheon meats and deli meats, unless they're reheated until steaming hot.	general
Keep fluid from hot dog packages away from other foods, utensils and food preparation surfaces.	general
Wash your hands after handling hot dogs, luncheon meats or deli meats.	general
Hot dogs, luncheon meats and deli meats.	general
Don't eat refrigerated pates or meat spreads.	general
Canned or shelf-stable pates and meat spreads are acceptable.	general
Meat spreads.	general
Don't eat refrigerated smoked seafood.	general
Such products may be labeled as nova style, lox, kippered or jerky.	general
One exception is if you're using these products in a casserole or other cooked dish.	general
Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood is acceptable.	general
Refrigerated smoked seafood.	general
Liver problems Liver problems Liver problems that can occur include fatty liver disease and cirrhosis.	general
The liver and its cells ‚Äî as seen through a microscope ‚Äî change dramatically when a normal liver becomes fatty or cirrhotic.	general
The liver is an organ about the size of a football that sits just under your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen.	general
The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances.	general
Liver disease can be inherited (genetic) or caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses and alcohol use.	general
Obesity is also associated with liver damage.	general
Over time, damage to the liver results in scarring (cirrhosis), which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition.	general
The liver is your largest internal organ.	general
About the size of a football, it's located mainly in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and above your stomach.	general
Signs and symptoms of liver disease include: Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice) Abdominal pain and swelling Chronic fatigue When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
Seek immediate medical attention if you have abdominal pain that is so severe that you can't stay still.	general
More Information Parasites and viruses can infect the liver, causing inflammation that reduces liver function.	general
The viruses that cause liver damage can be spread through blood or semen, contaminated food or water, or close contact with a person who is infected.	general
The most common types of liver infection are hepatitis viruses, including: Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Immune system abnormality Diseases in which your immune system attacks certain parts of your body (autoimmune) can affect your liver.	general
Examples of autoimmune liver diseases include: Autoimmune hepatitis An abnormal gene inherited from one or both of your parents can cause various substances to build up in your liver, resulting in liver damage.	general
Genetic liver diseases include: Hemochromatosis Chronic alcohol abuse Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of liver disease include: Heavy alcohol use Tattoos or body piercings Blood transfusion before 1992 Unprotected sex Complications Complications of liver disease vary, depending on the cause of your liver problems.	general
Untreated liver disease may progress to liver failure, a life-threatening condition.	general
To prevent liver disease: For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.	general
Heavy or high-risk drinking is defined as more than eight drinks a week for women and more than 15 drinks a week for men.	general
Drink alcohol in moderation.	general
Get help if you use illicit intravenous drugs, and don't share needles used to inject drugs.	general
Use a condom during sex.	general
If you choose to have tattoos or body piercings, be picky about cleanliness and safety when selecting a shop.	general
Avoid risky behavior.	general
If you're at increased risk of contracting hepatitis or if you've already been infected with any form of the hepatitis virus, talk to your doctor about getting the hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines.	general
Get vaccinated.	general
Take prescription and nonprescription drugs only when needed and only in recommended doses.	general
Don't mix medications and alcohol.	general
Talk to your doctor before mixing herbal supplements or prescription or nonprescription drugs.	general
Use medications wisely.	general
Hepatitis viruses can be spread by accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids.	general
Avoid contact with other people's blood and body fluids.	general
Make sure the room is ventilated, and wear a mask when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals.	general
Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.	general
Take care with aerosol sprays.	general
When using insecticides and other toxic chemicals, wear gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask.	general
Protect your skin.	general
Obesity can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
Tetanus is a serious disease caused by a bacterial toxin that affects your nervous system, leading to painful muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles.	general
Tetanus can interfere with your ability to breathe and can threaten your life.	general
"Tetanus is commonly known as ""lockjaw""."	general
Thanks to the tetanus vaccine, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world.	general
But the disease remains a threat to those who aren't up to date on their vaccinations.	general
It's more common in developing countries.	general
There's no cure for tetanus.	general
Treatment focuses on managing complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve.	general
Signs and symptoms of tetanus appear anytime from a few days to several weeks after tetanus bacteria enter your body through a wound.	general
The average incubation period is seven to 10 days.	general
Common signs and symptoms of tetanus include: Spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles (trismus) Stiffness of your neck muscles Difficulty swallowing Stiffness of your abdominal muscles Painful body spasms lasting for several minutes, typically triggered by minor occurrences, such as a draft, loud noise, physical touch or light Possible other signs and symptoms include: When to see a doctor See your doctor for a tetanus booster shot if you haven't had a booster shot within the past 10 years, or you have a deep or dirty wound and you haven't had a booster shot in five years.	general
If you aren't sure of when you received your last booster, get a booster.	general
Tetanus is caused by a toxin made by spores of bacteria, Clostridium tetani, found in soil, dust and animal feces.	general
When the spores enter a deep flesh wound, they grow into bacteria that can produce a powerful toxin, tetanospasmin.	general
The toxin impairs the nerves that control your muscles (motor neurons).	general
The toxin can cause muscle stiffness and spasms ‚Äî the major signs and symptoms of tetanus.	general
Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or in adults who haven't kept up with their 10-year booster shots.	general
You can't catch tetanus from a person who has it.	general
Risk factors The following increase your likelihood of getting tetanus: Failure to get vaccinated or to keep up to date with booster shots against tetanus An injury that lets tetanus spores into the wound A foreign body, such as a nail or splinter Tetanus cases have developed from the following: Puncture wounds ‚Äî including from splinters, body piercings, tattoos and injection drugs Gunshot wounds Compound fractures Infected umbilical stumps in newborns born of inadequately vaccinated mothers Complications Once tetanus toxin has bonded to your nerve endings it is impossible to remove.	general
Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months.	general
Complications of tetanus infection may include: The severity of spasms may cause the spine and other bones to break.	general
Broken bones.	general
A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches.	general
Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism).	general
Severe tetanus-induced (tetanic) muscle spasms can interfere with or stop your breathing.	general
Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death.	general
Lack of oxygen may also induce cardiac arrest and death.	general
Pneumonia is another cause of death.	general
The primary vaccine series The tetanus vaccine usually is given to children as part of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine.	general
This vaccination provides protection against three diseases: a throat and respiratory infection (diphtheria), whooping cough (pertussis) and tetanus.	general
The DTaP vaccine is a series of five shots, typically given in the arm or thigh to children at ages: The booster A booster of the tetanus vaccine is typically given in combination with a booster of diphtheria vaccine (Td).	general
In 2005, a tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine was approved for use in teens and adults under age 65 to ensure continuing protection against pertussis, too.	general
It's recommended that adolescents get a dose of Tdap, preferably between the ages of 11 and 12, and a Td booster every 10 years thereafter.	general
If you've never received a dose of Tdap, substitute it for your next Td booster dose and then continue with Td boosters.	general
If you're traveling internationally, particularly to a developing country where tetanus might be common, make sure your immunity is current.	general
To stay up to date with all of your vaccinations, ask your doctor to review your vaccination status regularly.	general
If you weren't vaccinated against tetanus as a child, see your doctor about getting the Tdap vaccine.	general
Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a heart rhythm condition that can potentially cause fast, chaotic heartbeats.	general
These rapid heartbeats might trigger a sudden fainting spell or seizure.	general
In some cases, the heart can beat erratically for so long that it causes sudden death.	general
You can have a genetic mutation that puts you at risk of being born with congenital long QT syndrome.	general
In addition, certain medications, imbalances of the body's salts and minerals (electrolyte abnormalities), and medical conditions might cause acquired long QT syndrome.	general
Long QT syndrome is treatable.	general
You might need to take medications to prevent an erratic heart rhythm.	general
In some cases, treatment for long QT syndrome involves surgery or an implantable device.	general
You'll also need to avoid certain medications that could trigger your long QT syndrome.	general
After treatment, you likely can live and thrive, even with this condition.	general
You may be able to continue being active in recreational ‚Äî and even competitive ‚Äî sports.	general
Results of an electrocardiogram (ECG) done for an unrelated reason A family history of long QT syndrome Genetic testing results For people who do experience signs and symptoms of long QT syndrome, the most common include: This is the most common sign of long QT syndrome.	general
Long QT syndrome-triggered fainting spells (syncope) are caused by the heart temporarily beating in an erratic way.	general
These fainting spells might happen when you're excited, angry, scared or during exercise.	general
You may lose consciousness without warning, for instance from being startled by a ringing telephone.	general
If you have a normal fainting spell, you usually will have a warning sign first, such as lightheadedness, heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat, weakness or blurred vision.	general
However, a fainting spell from long QT syndrome can occur with little to no warning.	general
If the heart continues to beat erratically, the brain will eventually not get enough oxygen, which can cause seizures.	general
Generally, the heart returns to its normal rhythm.	general
If this doesn't happen by itself, or if an external defibrillator isn't used in time to convert the rhythm back to normal, sudden death will occur.	general
Sudden death.	general
Signs and symptoms of inherited or congenital long QT syndrome might start as a fetus, during the first weeks to months after birth, as late as older age, or never at all.	general
Most people who experience signs or symptoms from long QT syndrome have their first episode by age 40.	general
Signs and symptoms of long QT syndrome might occur during sleep or arousal from sleep.	general
When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if you suddenly faint during physical exertion or emotional excitement or after use of a new medication, especially if the medication is known to prolong the QT interval.	general
Because long QT syndrome can occur in families, also tell your doctor that you'd like to be tested for long QT syndrome if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has been diagnosed with long QT syndrome.	general
More Information Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers.	general
The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood.	general
The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart.	general
The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.	general
Long QT syndrome is a heart rhythm disorder that can cause serious irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias).	general
Normally your heart circulates blood throughout your body during each heartbeat.	general
Your heart's chambers contract and relax to pump blood.	general
These actions are controlled by electrical impulses that travel through your heart and cause it to beat.	general
After each heartbeat, your heart's electrical system recharges itself in preparation for the next heartbeat.	general
In long QT syndrome, your heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats.	general
This electrical disturbance, which often can be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG), is called a prolonged QT interval.	general
Prolonged QT interval Prolonged Q-T interval Prolonged Q-T interval A prolonged QT interval refers to an abnormality seen on an electrocardiogram.	general
This abnormality reflects a disturbance in how your heart's bottom chambers (ventricles) conduct electricity.	general
An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures electrical impulses as they travel through your heart.	general
Patches with wires attached to your skin measure these impulses, which are displayed on a monitor or printed on paper as waves of electrical activity.	general
An ECG measures electrical impulses as five distinct waves.	general
Doctors label these five waves using the letters P, Q, R, S and T. The waves labeled Q through T show electrical activity in your heart's lower chambers (ventricles).	general
The space between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave (QT interval) corresponds to the time it takes for your heart to contract and then refill with blood before beginning the next contraction.	general
Doctors can measure whether the QT interval occurs in a normal amount of time.	general
If it takes longer than normal to occur, it's called a prolonged QT interval.	general
The upper limit of a normal QT interval takes into account age, sex, and regularity and speed of the heart rate.	general
Long QT syndrome results from abnormalities in the heart's electrical recharging system.	general
However, the heart's structure is normal.	general
Abnormalities in your heart's electrical system might be inherited.	general
Or, they may be acquired due to an underlying medical condition or a medication.	general
Inherited long QT syndrome At least 17 genes associated with long QT syndrome have been found so far, and hundreds of mutations within these genes have been identified.	general
Mutations in three of these genes account for about 75 percent of long QT syndrome cases, while mutations in the other minor genes contribute a small percent of long QT syndrome cases.	general
About 20 percent of people who definitely have congenital long QT syndrome have a negative genetic test result.	general
On the other hand, among families with genetically established long QT syndrome, between 10 percent and 37 percent of the relatives with a positive long QT syndrome genetic test have a normal QT interval.	general
Doctors have described two forms of inherited long QT syndrome: This more common form occurs in people who inherit only a single genetic variant from one parent.	general
Romano-Ward syndrome.	general
This rare form usually occurs earlier and is more severe.	general
In this syndrome, children inherit genetic variants from both parents.	general
They have long QT syndrome and also are born deaf.	general
Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.	general
Additionally, scientists have been investigating a possible link between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and long QT syndrome and have discovered that approximately five to 10 percent of babies affected by SIDS had a genetic defect or mutation for long QT syndrome.	general
Acquired long QT syndrome Acquired long QT syndrome can be caused by certain medications, electrolyte abnormalities such as low body potassium (hypokalemia) or medical conditions.	general
More than 100 medications ‚Äî many of them common ‚Äî can lengthen the QT interval in otherwise healthy people and cause a form of acquired long QT syndrome known as drug-induced long QT syndrome.	general
Medications that can lengthen the QT interval and upset heart rhythm include: Certain antibiotics Some antihistamines Some anti-nausea medications People who develop drug-induced long QT syndrome might also have some subtle genetic defects in their hearts.	general
These defects make them more likely to have disruptions in their heart rhythm from certain medications.	general
Risk factors People who may have a higher risk of inherited or acquired long QT syndrome may include: Children, teenagers and young adults with unexplained fainting, unexplained near drownings or other accidents, unexplained seizures, or a history of cardiac arrest Family members of children, teenagers and young adults with unexplained fainting, unexplained near drownings or other accidents, unexplained seizures, or a history of cardiac arrest First-degree relatives of people with known long QT syndrome People taking medications known to cause prolonged QT intervals People with low potassium, magnesium or calcium blood levels ‚Äî such as those with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa Inherited long QT syndrome often goes undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as a seizure disorder, such as epilepsy.	general
However, long QT syndrome might be responsible for some otherwise unexplained deaths in children and young adults.	general
For example, an unexplained drowning of a young person might be the first clue to inherited long QT syndrome in a family.	general
Complications Most of the time, prolonged QT intervals in people with long QT syndrome never cause problems.	general
"However, physical or emotional stress might ""trip up"" a heart that is sensitive to prolonged QT intervals."	general
This can cause the heart's rhythm to spin out of control, triggering life-threatening, irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias) including: In this arrhythmia, your heart's two lower chambers (ventricles) beat fast and chaotically, making the waves on an ECG monitor look twisted.	general
Less blood is pumped out from your heart, so less blood reaches your brain, causing you to faint suddenly and, often, without any warning.	general
Torsades de pointes ‚Äî 'twisting of the points.	general
' If a torsades de pointes episode is short ‚Äî lasting less than one minute ‚Äî your heart can correct itself and you regain consciousness on your own.	general
However, if a torsades de pointes episode lasts longer, it can result in a sudden fainting spell followed by a full-body seizure.	general
If the dangerous rhythm does not correct itself, then a life-threatening arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation follows.	general
This condition causes the ventricles to beat so fast that your heart quivers and ceases pumping blood.	general
Unless your heart is shocked back into a normal rhythm by a defibrillator, ventricular fibrillation can lead to brain damage and sudden death.	general
Ventricular fibrillation.	general
It's now known that long QT syndrome might explain some cases of sudden death in young people who otherwise appear healthy.	general
If you have inherited long QT syndrome, be careful about which medications you take.	general
Some medications ‚Äî including certain appetite suppressants, decongestants and common antibiotics ‚Äî might trigger dangerous heart rhythms.	general
Ask your doctor what you can and can't take safely.	general
Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, pose a serious risk for people with long QT syndrome.	general
In addition, seek medical treatment right away for illnesses that could result in low blood-potassium levels, especially if you have a lot of vomiting and diarrhea.	general
Such illnesses could trigger an episode of long QT syndrome.	general
Your doctor might advise you not to take some drugs, such as diuretics, that lower blood-potassium levels.	general
Some people ‚Äî especially older adults with long QT syndrome who haven't had signs or symptoms of the condition in decades ‚Äî may not need any treatment other than preventive measures.	general
Low sperm count means that the fluid (semen) you ejaculate during an orgasm contains fewer sperm than normal.	general
A low sperm count is also called oligospermia (ol-ih-go-SPUR-me-uh).	general
A complete absence of sperm is called azoospermia.	general
Your sperm count is considered lower than normal if you have fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen.	general
Having a low sperm count decreases the odds that one of your sperm will fertilize your partner's egg, resulting in pregnancy.	general
Nonetheless, many men who have a low sperm count are still able to father a child.	general
Products & Services The main sign of low sperm count is the inability to conceive a child.	general
There might be no other obvious signs or symptoms.	general
In some men, an underlying problem such as an inherited chromosomal abnormality, a hormonal imbalance, dilated testicular veins or a condition that blocks the passage of sperm may cause signs and symptoms.	general
Low sperm count symptoms might include: Problems with sexual function ‚Äî for example, low sex drive or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosome or hormone abnormality When to see a doctor See a doctor if you have been unable to conceive a child after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse or sooner if you have any of the following: Erection or ejaculation problems, low sex drive, or other problems with sexual function Pain, discomfort, a lump or swelling in the testicle area A history of testicle, prostate or sexual problems A groin, testicle, penis or scrotum surgery The production of sperm is a complex process and requires normal functioning of the testicles (testes) as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands ‚Äî organs in your brain that produce hormones that trigger sperm production.	general
Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis.	general
Problems with any of these systems can affect sperm production.	general
Also, there can be problems of abnormal sperm shape (morphology), movement (motility) or function.	general
However, often the cause of low sperm count isn't identified.	general
Medical causes Low sperm count can be caused by a number of health issues and medical treatments.	general
Some of these include: A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle.	general
It's the most common reversible cause of male infertility.	general
Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it might be related to abnormal testicular temperature regulation.	general
Varicoceles result in reduced quality of the sperm.	general
Varicocele.	general
Some infections can interfere with sperm production or sperm health or can cause scarring that blocks the passage of sperm.	general
These include inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) or testicles (orchitis) and some sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea or HIV.	general
Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved.	general
Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm instead of emerging out of the tip of the penis.	general
Various health conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation or lack of ejaculation, including diabetes, spinal injuries, and surgery of the bladder, prostate or urethra.	general
Ejaculation problems.	general
Certain medications also might result in ejaculatory problems, such as blood pressure medications known as alpha blockers.	general
Some ejaculatory problems can be reversed, while others are permanent.	general
In most cases of permanent ejaculation problems, sperm can still be retrieved directly from the testicles.	general
Anti-sperm antibodies are immune system cells that mistakenly identify sperm as harmful invaders and attempt to destroy them.	general
Antibodies that attack sperm.	general
Cancers and nonmalignant tumors can affect the male reproductive organs directly, through the glands that release hormones related to reproduction, such as the pituitary gland, or through unknown causes.	general
Surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors also can affect male fertility.	general
During fetal development one or both testicles sometimes fail to descend from the abdomen into the sac that normally contains the testicles (scrotum).	general
Decreased fertility is more likely in men with this condition.	general
Undescended testicles.	general
The hypothalamus, pituitary and testicles produce hormones that are necessary to create sperm.	general
Alterations in these hormones, as well as from other systems such as the thyroid and adrenal gland, may impair sperm production.	general
Hormone imbalances.	general
Many different tubes carry sperm.	general
They can be blocked due to various causes, including inadvertent injury from surgery, prior infections, trauma or abnormal development, such as with cystic fibrosis or similar inherited conditions.	general
Defects of tubules that transport sperm.	general
Blockage can occur at any level, including within the testicle, in the tubes that drain the testicle, in the epididymis, in the vas deferens, near the ejaculatory ducts or in the urethra.	general
Inherited disorders such as Klinefelter's syndrome ‚Äî in which a male is born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome instead of one X and one Y ‚Äî cause abnormal development of the male reproductive organs.	general
Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis, Kallmann's syndrome and Kartagener's syndrome.	general
Chromosome defects.	general
A digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, celiac disease can cause male infertility.	general
Fertility may improve after adopting a gluten-free diet.	general
Celiac disease.	general
Testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), certain antifungal and antibiotic medications, some ulcer medications, and other medications can impair sperm production and decrease male fertility.	general
Certain medications.	general
Certain surgeries might prevent you from having sperm in your ejaculate, including vasectomy, inguinal hernia repairs, scrotal or testicular surgeries, prostate surgeries, and large abdominal surgeries performed for testicular and rectal cancers, among others.	general
In most cases, surgery can be performed to either reverse these blockages or to retrieve sperm directly from the epididymis and testicles.	general
Prior surgeries.	general
Environmental causes Sperm production or function can be affected by overexposure to certain environmental elements, including: Extended exposure to benzenes, toluene, xylene, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, painting materials and lead might contribute to low sperm counts.	general
Industrial chemicals.	general
Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also can cause infertility.	general
Heavy metal exposure.	general
Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production.	general
It can take several years for sperm production to return to normal.	general
With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced.	general
Radiation or X-rays.	general
Elevated temperatures impair sperm production and function.	general
Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs might temporarily impair sperm count.	general
Overheating the testicles.	general
Sitting for long periods, wearing tight clothing or working on a laptop computer for long stretches of time also might increase the temperature in your scrotum and slightly reduce sperm production.	general
Health, lifestyle and other causes Other causes of low sperm count include: Anabolic steroids taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease.	general
Use of cocaine or marijuana might reduce the number and quality of your sperm as well.	general
Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels and cause decreased sperm production.	general
Alcohol use.	general
Certain occupations might be linked with a risk of infertility, including welding or those associated with prolonged sitting, such as truck driving.	general
However, the data to support these associations is inconsistent.	general
Occupation.	general
Men who smoke might have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke.	general
Tobacco smoking.	general
Severe or prolonged emotional stress, including stress about fertility, might interfere with hormones needed to produce sperm.	general
Emotional stress.	general
Being depressed may negatively affect sperm concentration.	general
Depression.	general
Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm and by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility.	general
Lower than normal sperm counts can result from testing a sperm sample that was taken too soon after your last ejaculation; was taken too soon after an illness or stressful event; or didn't contain all of the semen you ejaculated because some was spilled during collection.	general
For this reason, results are generally based on several samples taken over a period of time.	general
Sperm testing issues.	general
Risk factors A number of risk factors are linked to low sperm count and other problems that can cause low sperm count.	general
They include: Smoking tobacco Drinking alcohol Having certain past or present infections Being exposed to toxins Having experienced trauma to the testicles Being born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative, such as your brother or father, with a fertility disorder Having certain medical conditions, including tumors and chronic illnesses Undergoing cancer treatments, such as radiation Taking certain medications Having a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery Having a history of undescended testicles Complications Infertility caused by low sperm count can be stressful for both you and your partner.	general
Complications can include: Surgery or other treatments for an underlying cause of low sperm count Expensive and involved assisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) Stress related to the inability to have a child To protect your fertility, avoid known factors that can affect sperm count and quality.	general
For example: Don't smoke.	general
Limit or abstain from alcohol.	general
Steer clear of illicit drugs.	general
Talk to your doctor about medications that can affect sperm count.	general
Maintain a healthy weight.	general
Male hypogonadism is a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough of the hormone that plays a key role in masculine growth and development during puberty (testosterone) or enough sperm or both.	general
You can be born with male hypogonadism, or it can develop later in life, often from injury or infection.	general
The effects ‚Äî and what you can do about them ‚Äî depend on the cause and at what point in your life male hypogonadism occurs.	general
Some types of male hypogonadism can be treated with testosterone replacement therapy.	general
Male reproductive system Male reproductive system The male reproductive system makes, stores and moves sperm.	general
The testicles produce sperm.	general
Fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland combines with sperm to make semen.	general
The penis ejaculates semen during sexual intercourse.	general
Hypogonadism can begin during fetal development, before puberty or during adulthood.	general
Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops.	general
Fetal development If the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs.	general
Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with: Female genitals Genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals) Underdeveloped male genitals Male hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development.	general
It can hamper: Development of muscle mass And it can cause: Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Decreased sex drive Erectile dysfunction Decrease in muscle mass Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Loss of bone mass (osteoporosis) Severe hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes.	general
As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women.	general
These can include: Difficulty concentrating Hot flashes When to see a doctor See a doctor if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism.	general
Finding the cause of hypogonadism is an important first step to getting appropriate treatment.	general
Pituitary gland and hypothalamus Pituitary gland and hypothalamus The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are located within the brain and control hormone production.	general
Male hypogonadism means the testicles don't produce enough of the male sex hormone testosterone.	general
There are two basic types of hypogonadism: This type of hypogonadism ‚Äî also known as primary testicular failure ‚Äî originates from a problem in the testicles.	general
This type of hypogonadism indicates a problem in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland ‚Äî parts of the brain that signal the testicles to produce testosterone.	general
The hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which signals the pituitary gland to make follicle-stimulating hormone () and luteinizing hormone ().	general
Luteinizing hormone then signals the testes to produce testosterone.	general
Either type of hypogonadism can be caused by an inherited (congenital) trait or something that happens later in life (acquired), such as an injury or an infection.	general
At times, primary and secondary hypogonadism occur together.	general
Primary hypogonadism Common causes of primary hypogonadism include: This condition results from a congenital abnormality of the sex chromosomes, X and Y. A male normally has one X and one Y chromosome.	general
In Klinefelter syndrome, two or more X chromosomes are present in addition to one Y chromosome.	general
Klinefelter syndrome.	general
The Y chromosome contains the genetic material that determines the sex of a child and related development.	general
The extra X chromosome that occurs in Klinefelter syndrome causes abnormal development of the testicles, which in turn results in underproduction of testosterone.	general
Before birth, the testicles develop inside the abdomen and normally move down into their permanent place in the scrotum.	general
Sometimes one or both of the testicles aren't descended at birth.	general
Undescended testicles.	general
This condition often corrects itself within the first few years of life without treatment.	general
If not corrected in early childhood, it can lead to malfunction of the testicles and reduced production of testosterone.	general
A mumps infection involving the testicles that occurs during adolescence or adulthood can damage the testicles, affecting the function of the testicles and testosterone production.	general
Mumps orchitis.	general
Too much iron in the blood can cause testicular failure or pituitary gland dysfunction, affecting testosterone production.	general
Hemochromatosis.	general
Because they're outside the abdomen, the testicles are prone to injury.	general
Damage to normally developed testicles can cause hypogonadism.	general
Damage to one testicle might not impair total testosterone production.	general
Injury to the testicles.	general
Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer can interfere with testosterone and sperm production.	general
The effects of both treatments often are temporary, but permanent infertility may occur.	general
Cancer treatment.	general
Although many men regain their fertility within a few months after treatment, preserving sperm before starting cancer therapy is an option for men.	general
Secondary hypogonadism In secondary hypogonadism, the testicles are normal but don't function properly due to a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus.	general
A number of conditions can cause secondary hypogonadism, including: This is an abnormal development of the area of the brain that controls the secretion of pituitary hormones (hypothalamus).	general
This abnormality can also affect the ability to smell (anosmia) and cause red-green color blindness.	general
Kallmann's syndrome.	general
An abnormality in the pituitary gland can impair the release of hormones from the pituitary gland to the testicles, affecting normal testosterone production.	general
A pituitary tumor or other type of brain tumor located near the pituitary gland may cause testosterone or other hormone deficiencies.	general
Pituitary disorders.	general
Also, treatment for a brain tumor, such as surgery or radiation therapy, can affect the pituitary gland and cause hypogonadism.	general
Certain inflammatory diseases, such as sarcoidosis, histiocytosis and tuberculosis, involve the hypothalamus and pituitary gland and can affect testosterone production.	general
Inflammatory disease.	general
HIV/AIDS can cause low levels of testosterone by affecting the hypothalamus, the pituitary and the testes.	general
The use of certain drugs, such as opiate pain medications and some hormones, can affect testosterone production.	general
Medications.	general
Being significantly overweight at any age might be linked to hypogonadism.	general
As men age, there's a slow, progressive decrease in testosterone production.	general
The rate varies greatly.	general
Normal aging.	general
Risk factors Malnutrition Hypogonadism can be inherited.	general
If any of these risk factors are in your family health history, tell your doctor.	general
Complications The complications of untreated hypogonadism differ depending on when it develops ‚Äî during fetal development, puberty or adulthood.	general
Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs.	general
Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems ‚Äî including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs.	general
Lupus can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms often mimic those of other ailments.	general
The most distinctive sign of lupus ‚Äî a facial rash that resembles the wings of a butterfly unfolding across both cheeks ‚Äî occurs in many but not all cases of lupus.	general
Some people are born with a tendency toward developing lupus, which may be triggered by infections, certain drugs or even sunlight.	general
While there's no cure for lupus, treatments can help control symptoms.	general
Lupus facial rash Lupus facial rash A typical sign of lupus is a red, butterfly-shaped rash over your cheeks and nose, often following exposure to sunlight.	general
No two cases of lupus are exactly alike.	general
Signs and symptoms may come on suddenly or develop slowly, may be mild or severe, and may be temporary or permanent.	general
Most people with lupus have mild disease characterized by episodes ‚Äî called flares ‚Äî when signs and symptoms get worse for a while, then improve or even disappear completely for a time.	general
The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease.	general
The most common signs and symptoms include: Joint pain, stiffness and swelling Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure (photosensitivity) Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or during stressful periods (Raynaud's phenomenon) Shortness of breath Headaches, confusion and memory loss When to see a doctor See your doctor if you develop an unexplained rash, ongoing fever, persistent aching or fatigue.	general
More Information Lupus occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your body (autoimmune disease).	general
It's likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment.	general
It appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus.	general
The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown.	general
Some potential triggers include: Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people.	general
Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people.	general
Infections.	general
Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications and antibiotics.	general
People who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication.	general
Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped.	general
Medications.	general
Risk factors Lupus is more common in women.	general
Although lupus affects people of all ages, it's most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 45.	general
Lupus is more common in African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans.	general
Complications Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many areas of your body, including your: Lupus can cause serious kidney damage, and kidney failure is one of the leading causes of death among people with lupus.	general
If your brain is affected by lupus, you may experience headaches, dizziness, behavior changes, vision problems, and even strokes or seizures.	general
Many people with lupus experience memory problems and may have difficulty expressing their thoughts.	general
Brain and central nervous system.	general
Lupus may lead to blood problems, including anemia and increased risk of bleeding or blood clotting.	general
It can also cause inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis).	general
Blood and blood vessels.	general
Having lupus increases your chances of developing an inflammation of the chest cavity lining (pleurisy), which can make breathing painful.	general
Bleeding into lungs and pneumonia also are possible.	general
Lupus can cause inflammation of your heart muscle, your arteries or heart membrane (pericarditis).	general
The risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks increases greatly as well.	general
Other types of complications Having lupus also increases your risk of: People with lupus are more vulnerable to infection because both the disease and its treatments can weaken the immune system.	general
Having lupus appears to increase your risk of cancer; however the risk is small.	general
This occurs when the blood supply to a bone diminishes, often leading to tiny breaks in the bone and eventually to the bone's collapse.	general
Bone tissue death (avascular necrosis).	general
Women with lupus have an increased risk of miscarriage.	general
Lupus increases the risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy (preeclampsia) and preterm birth.	general
To reduce the risk of these complications, doctors often recommend delaying pregnancy until your disease has been under control for at least six months.	general

See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.	general
Kidney cross section Kidney cross section Blood enters your kidneys through your renal arteries.	general
Your kidneys remove excess fluid and waste material from your blood through units called nephrons.	general
Each nephron contains a filter (glomerulus) that has a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.	general
The glomeruli filter waste products and substances your body needs ‚Äî such as sodium, phosphorus and potassium ‚Äî which then pass through tiny tubules.	general
The substances your body needs are reabsorbed into your bloodstream.	general
The waste products and excess fluid form urine, which flows through the ureters ‚Äî the tubes that lead to the bladder.	general
Lupus nephritis is a frequent complication in people who have systemic lupus erythematosus ‚Äî more commonly known as lupus.	general
Lupus is an autoimmune disease.	general
It causes your immune system to produce proteins called autoantibodies that attack your own tissues and organs, including the kidneys.	general
Lupus nephritis occurs when lupus autoantibodies affect structures in your kidneys that filter out waste.	general
This causes kidney inflammation and may lead to blood in the urine, protein in the urine, high blood pressure, impaired kidney function or even kidney failure.	general
Blood in your urine High blood pressure Swelling in your hands, ankles or feet High levels of a waste product called creatinine in your blood As many as half of adults with systemic lupus develop lupus nephritis.	general
Systemic lupus causes immune system proteins to damage the kidneys, harming their ability to filter out waste.	general
How kidneys work Risk factors There aren't a lot of known risk factors for lupus nephritis, except for: Although women are more likely to get lupus, men get lupus nephritis more than women.	general
Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos and Asian Americans are more likely to have lupus nephritis than whites.	general
Race or ethnicity.	general
Complications Lupus nephritis can lead to worsened kidney function or kidney failure.	general
Lyme disease is caused by four main species of bacteria.	general
Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease in the United States, while Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading causes in Europe and Asia.	general
The most common tick-borne illness in these regions, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a deer tick.	general
You're more likely to get Lyme disease if you live or spend time in grassy and heavily wooded areas where ticks carrying Lyme disease thrive.	general
It's important to take common-sense precautions in tick-infested areas.	general
Lyme disease rash Lyme disease rash People with Lyme disease may experience a characteristic bull's-eye rash.	general
The rash gradually spreads over a period of days and may eventually reach up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across.	general
The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary.	general
They usually appear in stages, but the stages can overlap.	general
Early signs and symptoms A small, red bump, similar to the bump of a mosquito bite, often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days.	general
This normal occurrence doesn't indicate Lyme disease.	general
However, these signs and symptoms can occur within a month after you've been infected: From three to 30 days after an infected tick bite, an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center, forming a bull's-eye pattern.	general
The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across.	general
It's typically not itchy or painful but might feel warm to the touch.	general
Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease, although not everyone with Lyme disease develops the rash.	general
Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies.	general
Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, neck stiffness and swollen lymph nodes can accompany the rash.	general
Other symptoms.	general
Later signs and symptoms If untreated, new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months.	general
These include: The rash may appear on other areas of your body.	general
Erythema migrans.	general
Bouts of severe joint pain and swelling are especially likely to affect your knees, but the pain can shift from one joint to another.	general
Joint pain.	general
Weeks, months or even years after infection, you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis), temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy), numbness or weakness in your limbs, and impaired muscle movement.	general
Neurological problems.	general
Less common signs and symptoms Several weeks after infection, some people develop: Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat Eye inflammation If you've been bitten by a tick and have symptoms Only a minority of tick bites leads to Lyme disease.	general
The longer the tick remains attached to your skin, the greater your risk of getting the disease.	general
Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours.	general
If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease ‚Äî particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent ‚Äî contact your doctor.	general
Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early.	general
See your doctor even if symptoms disappear Consult your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear ‚Äî the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone.	general
Untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body for several months to years after infection, causing arthritis and nervous system problems.	general
Ticks can also transmit other illnesses, such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever.	general
The deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) goes through three life stages.	general
Shown from left to right is the adult female, adult male, nymph and larva on a centimeter scale.	general
In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii, carried primarily by black-legged or deer ticks.	general
Young brown ticks often are no bigger than a poppy seed, which can make them nearly impossible to spot.	general
To contract Lyme disease, an infected deer tick must bite you.	general
The bacteria enter your skin through the bite and eventually make their way into your bloodstream.	general
In most cases, to transmit Lyme disease, a deer tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours.	general
If you find an attached tick that looks swollen, it may have fed long enough to transmit bacteria.	general
Removing the tick as soon as possible might prevent infection.	general
Risk factors Where you live or vacation can affect your chances of getting Lyme disease.	general
So can your profession and the outdoor activities you enjoy.	general
The most common risk factors for Lyme disease include: In the United States, deer ticks are found mostly in the heavily wooded areas of the Northeast and Midwest.	general
Children who spend a lot of time outdoors in these regions are especially at risk.	general
Adults with outdoor occupations also are at increased risk.	general
Spending time in wooded or grassy areas.	general
Ticks attach easily to bare flesh.	general
If you're in an area where ticks are common, protect yourself and your children by wearing long sleeves and long pants.	general
Don't allow your pets to wander in tall weeds and grasses.	general
Having exposed skin.	general
Bacteria from a tick bite can enter your bloodstream if the tick stays attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours or longer.	general
If you remove a tick within two days, your risk of acquiring Lyme disease is low.	general
Not removing ticks promptly or properly.	general
Complications Chronic joint inflammation (Lyme arthritis), particularly of the knee Neurological symptoms, such as facial palsy and neuropathy Cognitive defects, such as impaired memory Heart rhythm irregularities The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid areas where deer ticks live, especially wooded, bushy areas with long grass.	general
You can decrease your risk of getting Lyme disease with some simple precautions: When in wooded or grassy areas, wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves.	general
Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass.	general
Keep your dog on a leash.	general
Apply insect repellent with a 20 percent or higher concentration of DEET to your skin.	general
Parents should apply repellant to their children, avoiding their hands, eyes and mouth.	general
Use insect repellents.	general
Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully.	general
Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pretreated clothing.	general
Clear brush and leaves where ticks live.	general
Mow your lawn regularly.	general
Stack wood neatly in dry, sunny areas to discourage rodents that carry ticks.	general
Do your best to tick-proof your yard.	general
Be especially vigilant after spending time in wooded or grassy areas.	general
Deer ticks are often no bigger than the head of a pin, so you might not discover them unless you search carefully.	general
Check your clothing, yourself, your children and your pets for ticks.	general
It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors.	general
Ticks often remain on your skin for hours before attaching themselves.	general
Showering and using a washcloth might remove unattached ticks.	general
You can get Lyme disease more than once.	general
Don't assume you're immune.	general
Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth.	general
Don't squeeze or crush the tick, but pull carefully and steadily.	general
Once you've removed the entire tick, dispose of it by putting it in alcohol or flushing it down the toilet, and apply antiseptic to the bite area.	general
Remove a tick as soon as possible with tweezers.	general

Lymph node locations Lymph node locations Your lymph nodes play a vital role in your body's ability to fight off infections.	general
Common areas where you might notice swollen lymph nodes include your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin.	general
Swollen lymph nodes Swollen lymph nodes One of the most common places to find swollen lymph nodes is in the neck.	general
The inset shows three swollen lymph nodes below the lower jaw.	general
Swollen lymph nodes usually occur as a result of infection from bacteria or viruses.	general
Rarely, swollen lymph nodes are caused by cancer.	general
Your lymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital role in your body's ability to fight off infections.	general
They function as filters, trapping viruses, bacteria and other causes of illnesses before they can infect other parts of your body.	general
Common areas where you might notice swollen lymph nodes include your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin.	general
In some cases, the passage of time and warm compresses may be all you need to treat swollen lymph nodes.	general
If an infection causes swollen lymph nodes, treatment depends on the cause.	general
Your lymphatic system is a network of organs, vessels and lymph nodes situated throughout your body.	general
Many lymph nodes are located in your head and neck region.	general
Lymph nodes that frequently swell are in this area, as well as in your armpits and groin area.	general
Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that something is wrong somewhere in your body.	general
When your lymph nodes first swell, you might notice: Tenderness and pain in the lymph nodes Swelling that may be the size of a pea or kidney bean, or even larger in the lymph nodes Depending on the cause of your swollen lymph nodes, other signs and symptoms you might have include: Runny nose, sore throat, fever and other indications of an upper respiratory infection General swelling of lymph nodes throughout your body.	general
When this occurs, it may indicate an infection, such as or mononucleosis, or an immune system disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis Hard, fixed, rapidly growing nodes, indicating a possible cancer or lymphoma When to see a doctor Some swollen lymph nodes return to normal when the underlying condition, such as a minor infection, gets better.	general
See your doctor if you're concerned or if your swollen lymph nodes: Have appeared for no apparent reason Continue to enlarge or have been present for two to four weeks Feel hard or rubbery, or don't move when you push on them Are accompanied by persistent fever, night sweats or unexplained weight loss if you're having difficulty swallowing or breathing.	general
Seek immediate medical care Lymph nodes are small, round or bean-shaped clusters of cells.	general
Inside lymph nodes are a combination of different types of immune system cells.	general
These specialized cells filter your lymphatic fluid as it travels through your body and protect you by destroying invaders.	general
Lymph nodes are located in groups, and each group drains a specific area of your body.	general
You may be more likely to notice swelling in certain areas, such as in the lymph nodes in your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin.	general
The site of the swollen lymph nodes may help identify the underlying cause.	general
The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an infection, particularly a viral infection, such as the common cold.	general
Other possible causes of swollen lymph nodes include: Common infections Strep throat Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ‚Äî the virus that causes AIDS Uncommon infections Certain sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis Toxoplasmosis ‚Äî a parasitic infection resulting from contact with the feces of an infected cat or eating undercooked meat Cat scratch fever ‚Äî a bacterial infection from a cat scratch or bite Immune system disorders Lupus ‚Äî a chronic inflammatory disease that targets your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs Rheumatoid arthritis ‚Äî a chronic inflammatory disease targeting the tissue that lines your joints (synovium) Lymphoma ‚Äî cancer that originates in your lymphatic system Leukemia ‚Äî cancer of your body's blood-forming tissue, including your bone marrow and lymphatic system Other cancers that have spread (metastasized) to lymph nodes Other possible but rare causes include certain medications, such as the anti-seizure medication phenytoin (Dilantin) and preventive medications for malaria.	general
Complications If infection is the cause of your swollen lymph nodes and isn't treated, an abscess may form.	general
Abscesses are localized collections of pus caused by infections.	general
Pus contains fluid, white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other invaders.	general
An abscess may require drainage and antibiotic treatment.	general
Lymphedema refers to swelling that generally occurs in one of your arms or legs.	general
Sometimes both arms or both legs swell.	general
Lymphedema is most commonly caused by the removal of or damage to your lymph nodes as a part of cancer treatment.	general
It results from a blockage in your lymphatic system, which is part of your immune system.	general
The blockage prevents lymph fluid from draining well, and the fluid buildup leads to swelling.	general
While there is presently no cure for lymphedema, it can be managed with early diagnosis and diligent care of your affected limb.	general
Lymphatic system Lymphatic system Your body's lymphatic system is part of your immune system, which protects you against infection and disease.	general
The lymphatic system includes your spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, as well as your tonsils and adenoids.	general
Leg lymphedema Leg lymphedema Lymphedema is swelling in an arm or a leg.	general
In rare circumstances it affects both arms or both legs.	general
It can also affect the chest wall and abdomen on occasion.	general
Lymphedema signs and symptoms, which occur in your affected arm or leg, include: Swelling of part or all of your arm or leg, including fingers or toes A feeling of heaviness or tightness Restricted range of motion Hardening and thickening of the skin (fibrosis) The swelling caused by lymphedema ranges from mild, hardly noticeable changes in the size of your arm or leg to extreme changes that make the limb hard to use.	general
Lymphedema caused by cancer treatment may not occur until months or years after treatment.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice persistent swelling in your arm or leg.	general
If you already have the diagnosis of lymphedema of a limb, see your doctor if there is a sudden dramatic increase in the size of the involved limb, as it may suggest a new process is occurring.	general
Your lymphatic system is crucial to keeping your body healthy.	general
It circulates protein-rich lymph fluid throughout your body, collecting bacteria, viruses and waste products.	general
Your lymphatic system carries this fluid and harmful substances through your lymph vessels, which lead to lymph nodes.	general
The wastes are then filtered out by lymphocytes ‚Äî infection-fighting cells that live in your lymph nodes ‚Äî and ultimately flushed from your body.	general
Lymphedema occurs when your lymph vessels are unable to adequately drain lymph fluid, usually from an arm or leg.	general
Lymphedema can be either primary or secondary.	general
This means it can occur on its own (primary lymphedema), or it can be caused by another disease or condition (secondary lymphedema).	general
Secondary lymphedema is far more common than primary lymphedema.	general
Causes of secondary lymphedema Any condition or procedure that damages your lymph nodes or lymph vessels can cause lymphedema.	general
Causes include: Removal of or injury to lymph nodes and lymph vessels may result in lymphedema.	general
For example, lymph nodes may be removed to check for spread of breast cancer, and lymph nodes may be injured in surgery that involves blood vessels in your limbs.	general
Radiation can cause scarring and inflammation of your lymph nodes or lymph vessels.	general
Radiation treatment for cancer.	general
If cancer cells block lymphatic vessels, lymphedema may result.	general
For instance, a tumor growing near a lymph node or lymph vessel could enlarge enough to block the flow of the lymph fluid.	general
An infection of the lymph nodes or parasites can restrict the flow of lymph fluid.	general
Infection-related lymphedema is most common in tropical and subtropical regions and is more likely to occur in developing countries.	general
Causes of primary lymphedema Primary lymphedema is a rare, inherited condition caused by problems with the development of lymph vessels in your body.	general
Specific causes of primary lymphedema include: This disorder begins in infancy and causes lymph nodes to form abnormally.	general
Milroy's disease (congenital lymphedema).	general
This disorder often causes lymphedema around puberty or during pregnancy, though it can occur later, until age 35.	general
Meige's disease (lymphedema praecox).	general
This occurs rarely and usually begins after age 35.	general
Late-onset lymphedema (lymphedema tarda).	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of developing lymphedema after cancer, from cancer treatment or from other secondary causes include: Complications Lymphedema in your arm or leg can lead to serious complications, such as: Possible infections that can result from lymphedema include a serious bacterial infection of the skin (cellulitis) and an infection of the lymph vessels (lymphangitis).	general
The smallest injury to your arm or leg can be an entry point for infection.	general
Infections.	general
This rare form of soft tissue cancer can result from the most-severe cases of untreated lymphedema.	general
Possible signs of lymphangiosarcoma include blue-red or purple marks on the skin.	general
Lymphangiosarcoma.	general
If you have had or you are going to have cancer surgery, ask your doctor whether your procedure will involve your lymph nodes or lymph vessels.	general
Ask if your radiation treatment will be aimed at lymph nodes, so you'll be aware of the possible risks.	general
To reduce your risk of lymphedema, try to: Avoid injury to your affected limb.	general
Cuts, scrapes and burns can invite infection.	general
Protect yourself from sharp objects.	general
For example, shave with an electric razor, wear gloves when you garden or cook, and use a thimble when you sew.	general
If possible, avoid medical procedures, such as blood draws and vaccinations, in your affected limb.	general
Protect your arm or leg.	general
After cancer treatment, exercise and stretching are encouraged.	general
But avoid strenuous activity until you've recovered from surgery or radiation.	general
Rest your arm or leg while recovering.	general
Don't apply ice or heat, such as with a heating pad, to your affected limb.	general
Also, protect your affected limb from extreme cold.	general
Avoid heat on your arm or leg.	general
Whenever possible, elevate your affected limb above the level of your heart.	general
Elevate your arm or leg.	general
Avoid anything that could constrict your arm or leg, such as tightfitting clothing and, in the case of your arm, blood pressure cuffs.	general
Ask that your blood pressure be taken in your other arm.	general
Avoid tight clothing.	general
Make skin and nail care high priorities.	general
Inspect the skin on your arm or leg daily, watching for changes or breaks in your skin that could lead to infection.	general
Don't go barefoot.	general
Keep your arm or leg clean.	general
Lymphatic system Lymphatic system Your body's lymphatic system is part of your immune system, which protects you against infection and disease.	general
The lymphatic system includes your spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, as well as your tonsils and adenoids.	general
Lymph node clusters Lymph node clusters Lymph nodes are bean-sized collections of lymphocytes.	general
About 600 of these nodes cluster throughout the lymphatic system, for example, near the knee, groin, neck and armpits.	general
The nodes are connected by a network of lymphatic vessels.	general
Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's germ-fighting network.	general
The lymphatic system includes the lymph nodes (lymph glands), spleen, thymus gland and bone marrow.	general
Lymphoma can affect all those areas as well as other organs throughout the body.	general
Many types of lymphoma exist.	general
The main subtypes are: Hodgkin's lymphoma (formerly called Hodgkin's disease) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma What lymphoma treatment is best for you depends on your lymphoma type and its severity.	general
Lymphoma treatment may involve chemotherapy, immunotherapy medications, radiation therapy, a bone marrow transplant or some combination of these.	general
Products & Services Swollen lymph nodes Swollen lymph nodes One of the most common places to find swollen lymph nodes is in the neck.	general
The inset shows three swollen lymph nodes below the lower jaw.	general
Signs and symptoms of lymphoma may include: Painless swelling of lymph nodes in your neck, armpits or groin Persistent fatigue When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.	general
Doctors aren't sure what causes lymphoma.	general
But it begins when a disease-fighting white blood cell called a lymphocyte develops a genetic mutation.	general
The mutation tells the cell to multiply rapidly, causing many diseased lymphocytes that continue multiplying.	general
The mutation also allows the cells to go on living when other normal cells would die.	general
This causes too many diseased and ineffective lymphocytes in your lymph nodes and causes the lymph nodes, spleen and liver to swell.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of lymphoma include: Some types of lymphoma are more common in young adults, while others are most often diagnosed in people over 55.	general
Males are slightly more likely to develop lymphoma than are females.	general
Being male.	general
Lymphoma is more common in people with immune system diseases or in people who take drugs that suppress their immune system.	general
Having an impaired immune system.	general
Some infections are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, including the Epstein-Barr virus and Helicobacter pylori infection.	general
Developing certain infections.	general
Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite.	general
The parasite is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.	general
People who have malaria usually feel very sick, with a high fever and shaking chills.	general
Each year, approximately 210 million people are infected with malaria, and about 440,000 people die from the disease.	general
Most of the people who die from the disease are young children in Africa.	general
While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries.	general
World health officials are trying to reduce the incidence of malaria by distributing bed nets to help protect people from mosquito bites as they sleep.	general
Scientists around the world are working to develop a vaccine to prevent malaria.	general
If you're traveling to locations where malaria is common, take steps to prevent mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing, using insect repellants and sleeping under treated mosquito nets.	general
Depending on the area you are visiting and your individual risk factors for infection, you may also want to take preventive medicine before, during and after your trip.	general
Many malaria parasites are now resistant to the most common drugs used to treat the disease.	general
"A malaria infection is generally characterized by the following signs and symptoms: Some people who have malaria experience cycles of malaria ""attacks""."	general
An attack usually starts with shivering and chills, followed by a high fever, followed by sweating and a return to normal temperature.	general
Malaria signs and symptoms typically begin within a few weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito.	general
However, some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in your body for up to a year.	general
When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor if you experience a fever while living in or after traveling to a high-risk malaria region.	general
The parasites that cause malaria can lie dormant in your body for up to a year.	general
If you have severe symptoms, seek emergency medical attention.	general
Malaria transmission cycle Malaria transmission cycle Malaria spreads when a mosquito becomes infected with the disease after biting an infected person, and the infected mosquito then bites a noninfected person.	general
The malaria parasites enter that person's bloodstream and travel to the liver.	general
When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect red blood cells.	general
Malaria is caused by a type of microscopic parasite.	general
The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites.	general
Mosquito transmission cycle A mosquito becomes infected by feeding on a person who has malaria.	general
Uninfected mosquito.	general
If this mosquito bites you in the future, it can transmit malaria parasites to you.	general
Transmission of parasite.	general
Once the parasites enter your body, they travel to your liver ‚Äî where some types can lie dormant for as long as a year.	general
In the liver.	general
When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect your red blood cells.	general
This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms.	general
Into the bloodstream.	general
If an uninfected mosquito bites you at this point in the cycle, it will become infected with your malaria parasites and can spread them to the other people it bites.	general
On to the next person.	general
Other modes of transmission Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people can also catch malaria from exposure to infected blood, including: From mother to unborn child Through blood transfusions Risk factors The biggest risk factor for developing malaria is to live in or to visit areas where the disease is common.	general
There are many different varieties of malaria parasites.	general
The variety that causes the most serious complications is most commonly found in: African countries south of the Sahara Desert The Asian subcontinent Risks of more-severe disease Young children and infants Pregnant women and their unborn children Poverty, lack of knowledge, and little or no access to health care also contribute to malaria deaths worldwide.	general
Immunity can wane Residents of a malaria region may be exposed to the disease so frequently that they acquire a partial immunity, which can lessen the severity of malaria symptoms.	general
However, this partial immunity can disappear if you move to a country where you're no longer frequently exposed to the parasite.	general
Complications Malaria can be fatal, particularly malaria caused by the variety of parasite that's common in tropical parts of Africa.	general
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 91 percent of all malaria deaths occur in Africa ‚Äî most commonly in children under the age of 5.	general
In most cases, malaria deaths are related to one or more serious complications, including: If parasite-filled blood cells block small blood vessels to your brain (cerebral malaria), swelling of your brain or brain damage may occur.	general
Cerebral malaria may cause seizures and coma.	general
Cerebral malaria.	general
Accumulated fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) can make it difficult to breathe.	general
Breathing problems.	general
Malaria can cause your kidneys or liver to fail, or your spleen to rupture.	general
Any of these conditions can be life-threatening.	general
Organ failure.	general
Malaria damages red blood cells, which can result in anemia.	general
Severe forms of malaria itself can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), as can quinine ‚Äî one of the most common medications used to combat malaria.	general
Very low blood sugar can result in coma or death.	general
Low blood sugar.	general
Malaria may recur Some varieties of the malaria parasite, which typically cause milder forms of the disease, can persist for years and cause relapses.	general
If you live in or are traveling to an area where malaria is common, take steps to avoid mosquito bites.	general
Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn.	general
To protect yourself from mosquito bites, you should: Wear pants and long-sleeved shirts.	general
Cover your skin.	general
Sprays containing DEET can be used on skin and sprays containing permethrin are safe to apply to clothing.	general
Apply insect repellant to skin and clothing.	general
Bed nets, particularly those treated with insecticide, help prevent mosquito bites while you are sleeping.	general
Sleep under a net.	general
Preventive medicine If you're going to be traveling to a location where malaria is common, talk to your doctor a few months ahead of time about whether you should take drugs before, during and after your trip to help protect you from malaria parasites.	general
In general, the drugs taken to prevent malaria are the same drugs used to treat the disease.	general
Your doctor needs to know when and where you'll be traveling so that he or she can help you evaluate your risk for infection and, if necessary, prescribe the drug that will work best on the type of malaria parasite most commonly found in that region.	general
No vaccine yet Scientists around the world are trying to develop a safe and effective vaccine for malaria.	general
As of yet, however, there is still no malaria vaccine approved for human use.	general

Malignant hyperthermia is a condition that triggers a severe reaction to certain drugs used as part of anesthesia for surgery.	general
Without prompt treatment, the disease can be fatal.	general
The genes that cause malignant hyperthermia are inherited.	general
In most cases, no signs or symptoms of the condition exist until you are exposed to anesthesia.	general
Treatments for the condition include medication and ice packs to cool the body temperature.	general
Signs and symptoms of malignant hyperthermia reaction include a dangerously high body temperature, severe muscle spasms and a fast heart rate.	general
In most cases, the genetic defect that causes malignant hyperthermia is inherited.	general
It is called a pharmacogenetic disorder because the reaction is caused by specific drugs.	general
Genetic testing can reveal whether you have these mutations.	general
If you have a parent, sibling or child with malignant hyperthermia, there is a 50 percent chance that you have the condition as well.	general
Other close relatives, such as aunts, uncles and grandchildren, have a 25 percent chance.	general
Men are more likely to have an episode of malignant hyperthermia than are women.	general
Children with the condition also are susceptible to reactions during surgery.	general
Malignant hyperthermia may not trigger a reaction during a person's first surgery.	general
However, the risk of a crisis remains for future surgeries.	general
For those at risk of having a reaction, other safe medications are available.	general
In rare cases, people with malignant hyperthermia have shown signs of a reaction after intense physical activity.	general
Malignant hyperthermia is caused by a gene that you have at birth.	general
If someone in your family has malignant hyperthermia and you need to have surgery, it's important to tell your doctor.	general
Other drugs may be used instead.	general
Risk factors Your risk of having malignant hyperthermia is higher if someone in your family has the condition.	general
If a parent, sibling or child has the condition, you have a 50 percent chance of having it too.	general
You have a 25 percent chance of having the condition if a close relative like an aunt, uncle, or grandchild has it.	general
Men are more likely than women to have malignant hyperthermia.	general
If someone in your family has malignant hyperthermia and you need to have surgery, it's important to tell your doctor.	general

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are a rare type of cancer that occurs in the lining of the nerves that extend from the spinal cord into the body.	general
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors used to be called neurofibrosarcomas.	general
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can occur anywhere in the body, but most often occur in the deep tissue of the arms, legs and trunk.	general
They tend to cause pain and weakness in the affected area and may also cause a growing lump or mass.	general
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are typically treated with surgery.	general
In certain cases, radiation therapy and chemotherapy also may be recommended.	general
Signs and symptoms of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors include: Pain in the affected area Weakness when trying to move the affected body part A growing lump of tissue under the skin When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.	general
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are rare, so your doctor may investigate more-common causes for your symptoms.	general
It's not clear what causes most malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.	general
Doctors know that these cancers begin when a cell in the protective lining around a nerve develops an error (mutation) in its DNA.	general
The mutation tells the cell to multiply rapidly and to continue living when other cells would normally die.	general
The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow to invade nearby tissue or spread to other areas of the body.	general
Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors include: A malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor may develop in the area treated with radiation 10 to 20 years after treatment.	general
Previous radiation therapy for cancer.	general
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can develop from noncancerous (benign) nerve tumors, such as neurofibroma.	general
Noncancerous nerve tumors.	general
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors occur more frequently in people with neurofibromatosis 1.	general
An inherited condition that increases risk of nerve tumors.	general
Mammary duct ectasia Mammary duct ectasia Mammary duct ectasia occurs when a milk duct beneath the nipple becomes wider (dilated) and filled with fluid.	general
The milk duct can then become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance.	general
Mammary duct ectasia usually causes no signs or symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct.	general
Mammary duct ectasia (ek-TAY-zhuh) occurs when a milk duct beneath your nipple widens, the duct walls thicken and the duct fills with fluid.	general
The milk duct may become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance.	general
The condition often causes no symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct (periductal mastitis).	general
Mammary duct ectasia most often occurs in women of perimenopausal age ‚Äî around 45 to 55 years ‚Äî but it can happen after menopause, too.	general
The condition sometimes improves without treatment.	general
If symptoms persist, you may need antibiotics or possibly surgery to remove the affected milk duct.	general
Though it's normal to worry about any changes in your breasts, mammary duct ectasia and periductal mastisis aren't risk factors for breast cancer.	general
Inverted nipple Inverted nipple A nipple that's always been turned inward (inverted) usually isn't a medical concern.	general
But a nipple that has recently turned inward should be checked by a doctor.	general
Mammary duct ectasia often doesn't cause any signs or symptoms.	general
If you do experience signs and symptoms, you may notice: A dirty white, greenish or black nipple discharge from one or both nipples Tenderness in the nipple or surrounding breast tissue Redness of the nipple and sometimes the surrounding area A breast lump or thickening near the clogged duct A nipple that's turned inward (inverted) A bacterial infection called mastitis also may develop in the affected milk duct, causing breast tenderness, inflammation in the area around the nipple (areola) and fever.	general
Signs and symptoms of mammary duct ectasia may improve on their own.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor for evaluation if you notice changes in your breasts ‚Äî such as a new breast lump, spontaneous nipple discharge or an inverted nipple ‚Äî that are persistent or that worry you.	general
Your breasts are made up of connective tissues that include a system of milk ducts ‚Äî tiny passages that carry milk to the nipples.	general
Mammary duct ectasia occurs when a milk duct beneath the nipple widens, becoming blocked or clogged with a sticky substance and inflamed.	general
Experts don't know exactly what causes mammary duct ectasia.	general
Some speculate the cause to be associated with: As you age, the composition of your breast tissue changes from mostly glandular to mostly fatty in a process called involution.	general
These normal breast changes can sometimes lead to a blocked milk duct and the inflammation associated with mammary duct ectasia.	general
Breast tissue changes due to aging.	general
Cigarette smoking may be associated with widening of milk ducts, which can lead to inflammation and, possibly, mammary duct ectasia.	general
A newly inverted nipple may obstruct milk ducts, causing inflammation and infection.	general
A nipple that's newly inverted could also be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as cancer.	general
Nipple inversion.	general
Complications Complications of mammary duct ectasia are usually minor and often more bothersome than serious.	general
These may include: Nipple discharge caused by mammary duct ectasia can be frustrating.	general
Fluid leaking from your nipples can cause embarrassing wetness and staining on your clothes.	general
Nipple discharge.	general
Mammary duct ectasia can cause redness, swelling and tenderness around your nipples.	general
Breast discomfort.	general
A bacterial infection (periductal mastitis) may develop in the affected milk duct, sometimes causing pain in or around the nipple, a general feeling of illness (malaise) or a fever.	general
Untreated infection could lead to an abscess ‚Äî a collection of pus in your breast tissue ‚Äî which may require a procedure to drain it.	general
When you notice a change in your breast, you may worry that it's a sign of breast cancer, especially if you develop a hard lump around a milk duct affected by mammary duct ectasia.	general
While it's important to get signs and symptoms checked out promptly, remember that mammary duct ectasia does not increase your risk of breast cancer.	general
Concern about breast cancer.	general
Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects connective tissue ‚Äî the fibers that support and anchor your organs and other structures in your body.	general
Marfan syndrome most commonly affects the heart, eyes, blood vessels and skeleton.	general
People with Marfan syndrome are usually tall and thin with disproportionately long arms, legs, fingers and toes.	general
The damage caused by Marfan syndrome can be mild or severe.	general
If your aorta ‚Äî the large blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body ‚Äî is affected, the condition can become life-threatening.	general
Treatment usually includes medications to keep your blood pressure low to reduce the strain on your aorta.	general
Regular monitoring to check for damage progression is vital.	general
Many people with Marfan syndrome eventually require preventive surgery to repair the aorta.	general
Marfan syndrome: The importance of diagnosis and treatment Products & Services Finger length in Marfan syndrome Finger length in Marfan syndrome People who have Marfan syndrome typically have especially long fingers.	general
It's common for their thumbs to extend far beyond the edge of their hands when they make a fist.	general
Longer arms in Marfan syndrome Longer arms in Marfan syndrome Your doctor may want to measure your arm span if he or she thinks you might have Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes people to have disproportionately long arms, legs and fingers.	general
The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary greatly, even among members of the same family.	general
Some people experience only mild effects, but others develop life-threatening complications.	general
In most cases, the disease tends to worsen with age.	general
Marfan syndrome features may include: Tall and slender build A breastbone that protrudes outward or dips inward A high, arched palate and crowded teeth Heart murmurs Extreme nearsightedness When to see a doctor If you think that you or your child may have Marfan syndrome, talk to your doctor or pediatrician.	general
If your doctor suspects a problem, you'll likely be referred to a specialist for further evaluation.	general
Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect in the gene that enables your body to produce a protein that helps give connective tissue its elasticity and strength.	general
Most people with Marfan syndrome inherit the abnormal gene from a parent who has the disorder.	general
Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the defective gene.	general
In about 25 percent of the people who have Marfan syndrome, the abnormal gene doesn't come from either parent.	general
In these cases, a new mutation develops spontaneously.	general
Risk factors Marfan syndrome affects men and women equally and occurs among all races and ethnic groups.	general
Because it's a genetic condition, the greatest risk factor for Marfan syndrome is having a parent with the disorder.	general
Complications Aneurysm at aortic root Aneurysm at aortic root The pressure of blood leaving your heart can cause the wall of your aorta to bulge out, like a weak spot in a tire.	general
In people who have Marfan syndrome, this is most likely to happen at the aortic root ‚Äî where the artery leaves your heart.	general
Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection An aortic aneurysm occurs when a weak spot in the wall of your aorta begins to bulge (left).	general
This can occur anywhere in your aorta.	general
Having an aneurysm increases the risk of a tear in the lining of the aorta, shown in the image on the right.	general
Lens dislocation Lens dislocation Some people who have Marfan syndrome may experience the dislocation of the lens in their eye.	general
Retinal detachment Retinal detachment Retinal detachment describes an emergency situation in which a thin layer of tissue (the retina) at the back of the eye pulls away from the layer of blood vessels that provides it with oxygen and nutrients.	general
Retinal detachment is often accompanied by flashes and floaters in your vision.	general
Viewed from the side, the normal spine takes the form of an elongated S, the upper back bowing outward and the lower back curving slightly inward.	general
Viewed from behind though, the spine should appear as a straight line from the base of the neck to the tailbone.	general
Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine.	general
Chest abnormalities Chest abnormalities Marfan syndrome can interfere with the normal development of the ribs, which can cause the breastbone to either protrude or appear sunken into the chest.	general
Because Marfan syndrome can affect almost any part of your body, it may cause a wide variety of complications.	general
Cardiovascular complications The most dangerous complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels.	general
Faulty connective tissue can weaken the aorta ‚Äî the large artery that arises from the heart and supplies blood to the body.	general
The pressure of blood leaving your heart can cause the wall of your aorta to bulge out, like a weak spot in a tire.	general
In people who have Marfan syndrome, this is most likely to happen at the aortic root ‚Äî where the artery leaves your heart.	general
Aortic aneurysm.	general
The wall of the aorta is made up of layers.	general
Dissection occurs when a small tear in the innermost layer of the aorta's wall allows blood to squeeze in between the inner and outer layers of the wall.	general
This can cause severe pain in the chest or back.	general
An aortic dissection weakens the vessel's structure and can result in a rupture, which may be fatal.	general
Aortic dissection.	general
People who have Marfan syndrome can have weaker tissue than normal in their heart valves.	general
This can produce stretching of the valve tissue and abnormal valve function.	general
When heart valves don't work properly, your heart often has to work harder to compensate.	general
This can eventually lead to heart failure.	general
Valve malformations.	general
Eye complications Eye complications may include: The focusing lens within your eye can move out of place if its supporting structures weaken.	general
The medical term for this problem is ectopia lentis, and it occurs in more than half the people who have Marfan syndrome.	general
Lens dislocation.	general
Marfan syndrome also increases the risk of a detachment or tear in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back wall of your eye.	general
Retinal problems.	general
People who have Marfan syndrome tend to develop these eye problems at a younger age.	general
Glaucoma causes the pressure within the eye to increase, which can damage the optic nerve.	general
Cataracts are cloudy areas in the eye's normally clear lens.	general
Early-onset glaucoma or cataracts.	general
Skeletal complications Marfan syndrome increases the risk of abnormal curves in the spine, such as scoliosis.	general
It can also interfere with the normal development of the ribs, which can cause the breastbone to either protrude or appear sunken into the chest.	general
Foot pain and low back pain are common with Marfan syndrome.	general
Complications of pregnancy Marfan syndrome can weaken the walls of the aorta, the main artery that leaves the heart.	general
During pregnancy, a woman's heart is pumping more blood than usual, and this can put extra stress on a woman's aorta ‚Äî which increases the risk of a deadly dissection or rupture.	general
Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is an inherited disorder that prevents your body from breaking down certain fats and converting them into energy.	general
As a result, the level of sugar in your blood can drop dangerously low.	general
MCAD deficiency is present from birth.	general
In the U.S., most states screen for MCAD deficiency at birth.	general
If MCAD deficiency is diagnosed and treated early, the disorder can be managed through diet and lifestyle actions.	general
In rare cases, the disorder is not diagnosed until adulthood.	general
Left untreated, it can lead to seizures, breathing difficulties, coma and other serious health problems.	general
Products & Services MCAD deficiency is an inherited disorder.	general
Signs and symptoms typically first appear in babies and young children.	general
The disorder can lead to early health problems, such as vomiting and lack of energy.	general
With MCAD, a defect (mutation) in your genes changes the way your body breaks down some fats.	general
Genetic testing can reveal whether you have these mutations.	general
You must inherit the affected genes from both of your parents.	general
If you inherit only one affected gene, you won't develop MCAD deficiency.	general
With one affected gene, you are a gene mutation carrier and can pass the mutation on to your children.	general
But they wouldn't develop the condition unless they also inherited an affected gene from the other parent.	general
Signs and symptoms of the disorder are often triggered when an affected person goes too long without eating.	general
Viral infections also can cause MCAD deficiency-related reactions.	general
Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass.	general
In muscular dystrophy, abnormal genes (mutations) interfere with the production of proteins needed to form healthy muscle.	general
There are many different kinds of muscular dystrophy.	general
Symptoms of the most common variety begin in childhood, mostly in boys.	general
Other types don't surface until adulthood.	general
There's no cure for muscular dystrophy.	general
But medications and therapy can help manage symptoms and slow the course of the disease.	general
The main sign of muscular dystrophy is progressive muscle weakness.	general
Specific signs and symptoms begin at different ages and in different muscle groups, depending on the type of muscular dystrophy.	general
Duchenne type muscular dystrophy This is the most common form of muscular dystrophy.	general
Although girls can be carriers and mildly affected, it's much more common in boys.	general
About one-third of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) don't have a family history of the disease, possibly because the gene involved may be subject to sudden abnormal change (spontaneous mutation).	general
Signs and symptoms typically appear in early childhood and may include: Frequent falls Trouble running and jumping Becker muscular dystrophy Signs and symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but tend to be milder and progress more slowly.	general
Symptoms generally begin in the teens but may not occur until the mid-20s or even later.	general
Other types of muscular dystrophy Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a specific feature or by where in the body symptoms first begin.	general
Examples include: Also known as Steinert's disease, this form is characterized by an inability to relax muscles at will following contractions.	general
Myotonic muscular dystrophy is the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy.	general
Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected.	general
Muscle weakness typically begins in the face and shoulders.	general
The shoulder blades might stick out like wings when a person with FSHD raises his or her arms.	general
Onset usually occurs in the teenage years but may begin in childhood or as late as age 40.	general
Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD).	general
This type affects boys and girls and is apparent at birth or before age 2.	general
Some forms progress slowly and cause only mild disability, while others progress rapidly and cause severe impairment.	general
Congenital.	general
Hip and shoulder muscles are usually the first affected.	general
People with this type of muscular dystrophy may have difficulty lifting the front part of the foot and as a result may trip frequently.	general
Onset usually begins in childhood or the teenage years.	general
Limb-girdle.	general
When to see a doctor Seek medical advice if you notice signs of muscle weakness ‚Äî such as increased clumsiness and falling ‚Äî in yourself or your child.	general
Certain genes are involved in making proteins that protect muscle fibers from damage.	general
Muscular dystrophy occurs when one of these genes is defective.	general
Each form of muscular dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation particular to that type of the disease.	general
Many of these mutations are inherited.	general
But some occur spontaneously in the mother's egg or the developing embryo and can be passed on to the next generation.	general
Risk factors Muscular dystrophy occurs in both sexes and in all ages and races.	general
However, the most common variety, Duchenne, usually occurs in young boys.	general
People with a family history of muscular dystrophy are at higher risk of developing the disease or passing it on to their children.	general
Complications The complications of progressive muscle weakness include: Some people with muscular dystrophy eventually need to use a wheelchair.	general
Trouble walking.	general
Contractures can further limit mobility.	general
Shortening of muscles or tendons around joints (contractures).	general
Progressive weakness can affect the muscles associated with breathing.	general
People with muscular dystrophy may eventually need to use a breathing assistance device (ventilator), initially at night but possibly also during the day.	general
Breathing problems.	general
Weakened muscles may be unable to hold the spine straight.	general
Curved spine (scoliosis).	general
Muscular dystrophy can reduce the efficiency of the heart muscle.	general
Heart problems.	general
If the muscles involved with swallowing are affected, nutritional problems and aspiration pneumonia may develop.	general
Feeding tubes may be an option.	general
Swallowing problems.	general
Measles causes a red, blotchy rash that usually appears first on the face and behind the ears, then spreads downward to the chest and back and finally to the feet.	general
Measles is a childhood infection caused by a virus.	general
Once quite common, measles can now almost always be prevented with a vaccine.	general
Also called rubeola, measles can be serious and even fatal for small children.	general
While death rates have been falling worldwide as more children receive the measles vaccine, the disease still kills more than 100,000 people a year, most under the age of 5.	general
As a result of high vaccination rates in general, measles hasn't been widespread in the United States for more than a decade.	general
The United States averaged about 60 cases of measles a year from 2000 to 2010, but the average number of cases jumped to 205 a year in recent years.	general
Most of these cases originate outside the country and occurred in people who were unvaccinated or who didn't know whether or not they had been vaccinated.	general
Measles signs and symptoms appear around 10 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.	general
Signs and symptoms of measles typically include: Inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) Tiny white spots with bluish-white centers on a red background found inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek ‚Äî also called Koplik's spots A skin rash made up of large, flat blotches that often flow into one another The infection occurs in sequential stages over a period of two to three weeks.	general
For the first 10 to 14 days after you're infected, the measles virus incubates.	general
You have no signs or symptoms of measles during this time.	general
Infection and incubation.	general
Measles typically begins with a mild to moderate fever, often accompanied by a persistent cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) and sore throat.	general
This relatively mild illness may last two or three days.	general
Nonspecific signs and symptoms.	general
The rash consists of small red spots, some of which are slightly raised.	general
Spots and bumps in tight clusters give the skin a splotchy red appearance.	general
The face breaks out first.	general
Acute illness and rash.	general
Over the next few days, the rash spreads down the arms and trunk, then over the thighs, lower legs and feet.	general
At the same time, the fever rises sharply, often as high as 104 to 105.	general
8 F (40 to 41 C).	general
The measles rash gradually recedes, fading first from the face and last from the thighs and feet.	general
A person with measles can spread the virus to others for about eight days, starting four days before the rash appears and ending when the rash has been present for four days.	general
Communicable period.	general
When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you think you or your child may have been exposed to measles or if you or your child has a rash resembling measles.	general
Review your family's vaccination records with your doctor, especially before your children start elementary school or college and before international travel.	general
Measles is a highly contagious illness caused by a virus that replicates in the nose and throat of an infected child or adult.	general
Then, when someone with measles coughs, sneezes or talks, infected droplets spray into the air, where other people can inhale them.	general
The infected droplets may also land on a surface, where they remain active and contagious for several hours.	general
You can contract the virus by putting your fingers in your mouth or nose or rubbing your eyes after touching the infected surface.	general
About 90 percent of susceptible people who are exposed to someone with the virus will be infected.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for measles include: If you haven't received the vaccine for measles, you're much more likely to develop the disease.	general
Being unvaccinated.	general
If you travel to developing countries, where measles is more common, you're at higher risk of catching the disease.	general
Traveling internationally.	general
If you don't have enough vitamin A in your diet, you're more likely to have more-severe symptoms and complications.	general
Having a vitamin A deficiency.	general
Complications Complications of measles may include: One of the most common complications of measles is a bacterial ear infection.	general
Ear infection.	general
Measles may lead to inflammation of your voice box (larynx) or inflammation of the inner walls that line the main air passageways of your lungs (bronchial tubes).	general
Bronchitis, laryngitis or croup.	general
Pneumonia is a common complication of measles.	general
People with compromised immune systems can develop an especially dangerous variety of pneumonia that is sometimes fatal.	general
About 1 in 1,000 people with measles develops a complication called encephalitis.	general
Encephalitis may occur right after measles, or it might not occur until months later.	general
Encephalitis.	general
If you're pregnant, you need to take special care to avoid measles because the disease can cause preterm labor, low birth weight and maternal death.	general
Pregnancy problems.	general
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children and adults receive the measles vaccine to prevent measles.	general
Measles vaccine in children To prevent measles in children, doctors usually give infants the first dose of the vaccine between 12 and 15 months, with the second dose typically given between ages 4 and 6 years.	general
Keep in mind: If you'll be traveling abroad when your child is 6 to 11 months old, talk with your child's doctor about getting the measles vaccine earlier.	general
If your child or teenager didn't get the two doses at the recommended times, he or she may need two doses of the vaccine four weeks apart.	general
Measles vaccine in adults You may need the measles vaccine if you're an adult who: Has an increased risk of measles ‚Äî such as attending college, traveling internationally or working in a hospital environment ‚Äî and you don't have proof of immunity.	general
Proof of immunity includes written documentation of your vaccinations or lab confirmation of immunity or previous illness.	general
Was born in 1957 or later and you don't have proof of immunity.	general
Proof of immunity includes written documentation of your vaccinations or lab confirmation of immunity or previous illness.	general
If you're not sure if you need the measles vaccine, talk to your doctor.	general
Preventing measles during an outbreak or known infection If someone in your household has measles, take these precautions to protect vulnerable family and friends: Because measles is highly contagious from about four days before to four days after the rash breaks out, people with measles shouldn't return to activities in which they interact with other people during this period.	general
It may also be necessary to keep nonimmunized people ‚Äî siblings, for example ‚Äî away from the infected person.	general
Be sure that anyone who's at risk of getting the measles who hasn't been fully vaccinated receives the measles vaccine as soon as possible.	general
This includes infants older than 6 months and anyone born in 1957 or later who doesn't have written documentation of being vaccinated, or who doesn't have evidence of immunity or having had measles in the past.	general
Preventing new infections If you've already had measles, your body has built up its immune system to fight the infection, and you can't get measles again.	general
Most people born or living in the United States before 1957 are immune to measles, simply because they've already had it.	general
For everyone else, there's the measles vaccine, which is important for: Since the introduction of the measles vaccine, measles has virtually been eliminated in the United States, even though not everyone has been vaccinated.	general
This effect is called herd immunity.	general
Promoting and preserving widespread immunity.	general
But herd immunity may now be weakening a bit, likely due to a drop in vaccination rates.	general
The incidence of measles in the U.S. recently increased significantly.	general
Steady vaccination rates are important because soon after vaccination rates decline, measles begins to come back.	general
In 1998, a now-discredited study was published erroneously linking autism to the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.	general
Preventing a resurgence of measles.	general
In the United Kingdom, where the study originated, the rate of vaccination dropped to an all-time low of about 80 percent of all children in 2003-2004.	general
In 2008, there were nearly 1,400 lab-confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales.	general
"The term ""shin splints"" refers to pain along the shin bone (tibia) ‚Äî the large bone in the front of your lower leg."	general
Shin splints are common in runners, dancers and military recruits.	general
Medically known as medial tibial stress syndrome, shin splints often occur in athletes who have recently intensified or changed their training routines.	general
The increased activity overworks the muscles, tendons and bone tissue.	general
Most cases of shin splints can be treated with rest, ice and other self-care measures.	general
Wearing proper footwear and modifying your exercise routine can help prevent shin splints from recurring.	general
If you have shin splints, you might notice tenderness, soreness or pain along the inner side of your shinbone and mild swelling in your lower leg.	general
At first, the pain might stop when you stop exercising.	general
Eventually, however, the pain can be continuous and might progress to a stress reaction or stress fracture.	general
When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if rest, ice and over-the-counter pain relievers don't ease your shin pain.	general
Shin splints are caused by repetitive stress on the shinbone and the connective tissues that attach your muscles to the bone.	general
Risk factors You're a runner, especially one beginning a running program You suddenly increase the duration, frequency or intensity of exercise You run on uneven terrain, such as hills, or hard surfaces, such as concrete You're in military training To help prevent shin splints: A formal video analysis of your running technique can help to identify movement patterns that can contribute to shin splints.	general
In many cases, a slight change in your running can help decrease your risk.	general
Analyze your movement.	general
Too much running or other high-impact activity performed for too long at too high an intensity can overload the shins.	general
Avoid overdoing.	general
If you're a runner, replace your shoes about every 350 to 500 miles (560 to 800 kilometers).	general
Choose the right shoes.	general
Arch supports can help prevent the pain of shin splints, especially if you have flat arches.	general
Consider arch supports.	general
They might reduce shin splint symptoms and prevent recurrence.	general
Consider shock-absorbing insoles.	general
Cross-train with a sport that places less impact on your shins, such as swimming, walking or biking.	general
Remember to start new activities slowly.	general
Increase time and intensity gradually.	general
Lessen the impact.	general
Exercises to strengthen and stabilize your legs, ankles, hips and core can help prepare your legs to deal with high-impact sports.	general
Add strength training to your workout.	general
Medication overuse headaches or rebound headaches are caused by regular, long-term use of medication to treat headaches, such as migraines.	general
Pain relievers offer relief for occasional headaches.	general
But if you take them more than a couple of days a week, they may trigger medication overuse headaches.	general
If you have a headache disorder, any medication you take for pain relief can cause rebound headaches.	general
Pain relievers taken regularly for another condition, such as arthritis, haven't been shown to cause medication overuse headaches in people who never had a headache disorder.	general
Medication overuse headaches usually stop when you stop taking pain medication.	general
It's tough in the short term, but your doctor can help you beat medication overuse headaches for long-term relief.	general
Signs and symptoms of medication overuse headaches may differ according to the type of original headache being treated and the medication used.	general
Medication overuse headaches tend to: Occur every day or nearly every day, often waking you in the early morning Improve with pain relief medication but then return as your medication wears off Other signs and symptoms may include: Restlessness When to see a doctor Occasional headaches are common.	general
But it's important to take your headaches seriously.	general
Some types of headaches can be life-threatening.	general
if your headache: Seek immediate medical care Is sudden and severe Accompanies a fever, stiff neck, rash, confusion, seizure, double vision, weakness, numbness or difficulty speaking Follows a head injury Gets worse despite rest and pain medication Is a new type that's persistent, especially in someone older than 50 Occurs with shortness of breath Happens when you're upright but goes away if you're lying flat Consult your doctor You usually have two or more headaches a week You take a pain reliever for your headaches more than twice a week You need more than the recommended dose of over-the-counter pain remedies to relieve your headaches Your headache pattern changes Doctors don't yet know exactly why medication overuse leads to rebound headaches.	general
The risk of developing medication overuse headaches varies depending on the medication, but any acute headache medication has the potential to lead to medication overuse headaches, including: Common pain relievers such as aspirin and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) may contribute to medication overuse headaches ‚Äî especially if you exceed the recommended daily dosages.	general
Pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) have a low risk of contributing to medication overuse headaches.	general
Simple pain relievers.	general
Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers that combine caffeine, aspirin and acetaminophen (Excedrin, others) are common culprits.	general
Combination pain relievers.	general
This group also includes prescription medications such as Fiorinal, which contains the sedative butalbital.	general
Butalbital-containing compounds have an especially high risk of causing medication overuse headaches, so it's best not to take them to treat headaches.	general
Various migraine medications have been linked with medication overuse headaches, including triptans (Imitrex, Zomig, others) and certain ergots ‚Äî such as ergotamine (Ergomar, others).	general
These medications have a moderate risk of causing medication overuse headaches.	general
The ergot dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45) appears to have a lower potential for leading to this problem.	general
Migraine medications.	general
Painkillers derived from opium or from synthetic opium compounds include combinations of codeine and acetaminophen (Tylenol with Codeine No.	general
3 and No.	general
4, others).	general
These medications have a high risk of causing medication overuse headaches.	general
Daily doses of caffeine ‚Äî from coffee, soda, and pain relievers and other products containing this mild stimulant ‚Äî may fuel medication overuse headaches, as well.	general
Read product labels to make sure you're not wiring your system with more caffeine than you realize.	general
Risk factors A history of chronic headaches, especially migraines, puts you at risk.	general
History of chronic headaches.	general
Your risk increases if you use combination analgesics, ergotamine or triptans 10 or more days a month or simple analgesics more than 15 days a month ‚Äî especially if this regular use continues for three or more months.	general
Frequent use of headache medications.	general
To help prevent medication overuse headaches: Take your headache medication as prescribed.	general
If you need headache medication more than twice a week, contact your doctor.	general
Avoid medications that contain butalbital or opioids.	general
Use OTC painkillers less than 15 days a month.	general
Limit use of triptans or combination analgesics to no more than nine days a month.	general
Taking care of yourself can help prevent most headaches.	general
If you're not sure what triggers your headaches, keep a headache diary with details about every headache.	general
Eventually, you may see a pattern.	general
Avoid headache triggers.	general
Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day ‚Äî even on weekends.	general
Get enough sleep.	general
Start your day with a healthy breakfast.	general
Eat lunch and dinner at about the same time every day.	general
Don't skip meals.	general
Be sure to drink plenty of water or other uncaffeinated fluids.	general
Stay hydrated.	general
Physical activity causes your body to release chemicals that block pain signals to your brain.	general
With your doctor's OK, choose activities you enjoy ‚Äî such as walking, swimming or cycling.	general
Exercise regularly.	general
Get organized.	general
Simplify your schedule, and plan ahead.	general
Try to stay positive.	general
Reduce stress.	general
Obesity can contribute to headache development, so if you need to lose weight, find a program that works for you.	general
Lose weight.	general
If you smoke, talk to your doctor about quitting.	general
Smoking is linked to a higher risk of medication overuse headaches.	general
Quit smoking.	general
Medulloblastoma Medulloblastoma Medulloblastoma Medulloblastoma is a type of brain cancer that starts in the part of the brain called the cerebellum.	general
Medulloblastoma is the most common type of cancerous brain tumor in children.	general
Medulloblastoma (muh-dul-o-blas-TOE-muh) is a cancerous (malignant) brain tumor that starts in the lower back part of the brain, called the cerebellum.	general
The cerebellum is involved in muscle coordination, balance and movement.	general
Medulloblastoma tends to spread through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ‚Äî the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spinal cord ‚Äî to other areas around the brain and spinal cord.	general
This tumor rarely spreads to other areas of the body.	general
Medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor ‚Äî a tumor that starts in the fetal (embryonic) cells in the brain.	general
Based on different types of gene mutations, there are at least four subtypes of medulloblastoma.	general
Though medulloblastoma is not inherited, syndromes such as Gorlin's syndrome or Turcot's syndrome might increase the risk of medulloblastoma.	general
Signs and symptoms of medulloblastoma may include headaches, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, dizziness, double vision, poor coordination, unsteady walk and other concerns.	general
These symptoms may be related to the tumor itself or be due to the buildup of pressure within the brain.	general
Medulloblastoma can occur at any age, but most often occurs in young children.	general
Though medulloblastoma is rare, it's the most common cancerous brain tumor in children.	general
Children need to be seen at a center that has a team of pediatric specialists with expertise and experience in pediatric brain tumors, with access to the latest technology and treatments for children.	general
The process of diagnosis usually starts with a medical history review and a discussion of signs and symptoms.	general
Tests and procedures used to diagnose medulloblastoma include: During this procedure, vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes are tested.	general
This helps determine which part of the brain might be affected by the tumor.	general
Neurological exam.	general
Imaging tests can help determine the location and size of the brain tumor.	general
These tests are also very important to identify pressure or blockage of the CSF pathways.	general
A computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done right away.	general
These tests are often used to diagnose brain tumors.	general
Advanced techniques, such as perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, also may be used.	general
Imaging tests.	general
A biopsy is usually not done, but it may be recommended if the imaging tests are not typical of medulloblastoma.	general
The sample of suspicious tissue is analyzed in a lab to determine the types of cells.	general
Tissue sample testing (biopsy).	general
Also called a spinal tap, this procedure involves inserting a needle between two bones in the lower spine to draw out cerebrospinal fluid from around the spinal cord.	general
The fluid is tested to look for tumor cells or other abnormalities.	general
This test is only done after managing the pressure in the brain or removing the tumor.	general
Removal of cerebrospinal fluid for testing (lumbar puncture).	general
Treatment for medulloblastoma usually includes surgery followed by radiation or chemotherapy, or both.	general
Age and general health, tumor subtype and location, tumor grade and extent, and other factors play a role in treatment decisions.	general
Options include: A medulloblastoma may grow to block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which can cause a buildup of fluid that puts pressure on the brain (hydrocephalus).	general
Surgery to create a pathway for the fluid to flow out of the brain (external ventricular drain or ventriculoperitoneal shunt) may be recommended.	general
Sometimes this procedure can be combined with surgery to remove the tumor.	general
Surgery to relieve fluid buildup in the brain.	general
A pediatric or adult brain surgeon (neurosurgeon) removes the tumor, taking care not to harm nearby tissue.	general
But sometimes it's not possible to remove the tumor entirely because medulloblastoma forms near critical structures deep within the brain.	general
All patients with medulloblastoma should receive additional treatments after surgery to target any remaining cells.	general
Surgery to remove the medulloblastoma.	general
A pediatric or adult radiation oncologist administers radiation therapy to the brain and spinal cord using high-energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells.	general
Standard radiation therapy can be used, but proton beam therapy ‚Äî available at a limited number of major health care centers in the United States ‚Äî delivers higher targeted doses of radiation to brain tumors, minimizing radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissue.	general
Radiation therapy.	general
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill tumor cells.	general
Typically, children and adults with medulloblastoma receive these drugs as an injection into the vein (intravenous chemotherapy).	general
Chemotherapy may be recommended after surgery or radiation therapy, or in certain cases, at the same time as radiation therapy.	general
In some cases, high dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell rescue (a stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells) may be used.	general
Chemotherapy.	general
Clinical trials enroll eligible participants to study the effectiveness of new treatments or to study new ways of using existing treatments, such as different combinations or timing of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.	general
These studies provide a chance to try the latest treatment options, though the risk of side effects may not be known.	general
Talk with your doctor for advice.	general
Clinical trials.	general
Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that begins in the cells (melanocytes) that control the pigment in your skin.	general
This illustration shows melanoma cells extending from the surface of the skin into the deeper skin layers.	general
Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin ‚Äî the pigment that gives your skin its color.	general
Melanoma can also form in your eyes and, rarely, in internal organs, such as your intestines.	general
The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds increases your risk of developing melanoma.	general
Limiting your exposure to UV radiation can help reduce your risk of melanoma.	general
The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women.	general
Knowing the warning signs of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread.	general
Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is detected early.	general
Products & Services Moles are usually harmless.	general
They may contain hairs or become raised or wrinkled.	general
Talk to your doctor about any change in the color or size of a mole or if itching, pain, bleeding or inflammation develops.	general
The first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color.	general
This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs.	general
Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body.	general
They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face.	general
Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds.	general
These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin.	general
The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole.	general
It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin.	general
Normal moles Normal moles are generally a uniform color ‚Äî such as tan, brown or black ‚Äî with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin.	general
They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter ‚Äî the size of a pencil eraser.	general
Most people have between 10 and 45 moles.	general
Many of these develop by age 50, although moles may change in appearance over time ‚Äî some may even disappear with age.	general
Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE: Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves.	general
A is for asymmetrical shape.	general
Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders ‚Äî characteristics of melanomas.	general
B is for irregular border.	general
Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color.	general
C is for changes in color.	general
Look for new growth in amole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).	general
D is for diameter.	general
Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape.	general
Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding.	general
E is for evolving.	general
Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance.	general
Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.	general
Hidden melanomas Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals.	general
These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check.	general
When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area.	general
Hidden melanomas include: Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail.	general
It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet.	general
It's more common in black people and in other people with darker skin pigment.	general
Melanoma under a nail.	general
Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina.	general
Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions.	general
Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina.	general
Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea ‚Äî the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera).	general
An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.	general
Melanoma in the eye.	general
When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any skin changes that seem unusual.	general
Where skin cancer develops Where skin cancer develops Skin cancer begins in the cells that make up the outer layer (epidermis) of your skin.	general
One type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells, which make skin cells that continuously push older cells toward the surface.	general
As new cells move upward, they become flattened squamous cells, where a skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma can occur.	general
Melanoma, another type of skin cancer, arises in the pigment cells (melanocytes).	general
Melanoma occurs when something goes awry in the melanin-producing cells (melanocytes) that give color to your skin.	general
Normally, skin cells develop in a controlled and orderly way ‚Äî healthy new cells push older cells toward your skin's surface, where they die and eventually fall off.	general
But when some cells develop DNA damage, new cells may begin to grow out of control and can eventually form a mass of cancerous cells.	general
Just what damages DNA in skin cells and how this leads to melanoma isn't clear.	general
It's likely that a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors, causes melanoma.	general
Still, doctors believe exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds is the leading cause of melanoma.	general
UV light doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight.	general
This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.	general
Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of melanoma include: Having less pigment (melanin) in your skin means you have less protection from damaging UV radiation.	general
If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you're more likely to develop melanoma than is someone with a darker complexion.	general
But melanoma can develop in people with darker complexions, including Hispanic people and black people.	general
One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma.	general
A history of sunburn.	general
Exposure to UV radiation, which comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds, can increase the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.	general
Excessive ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.	general
People living closer to the earth's equator, where the sun's rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living in higher latitudes.	general
In addition, if you live at a high elevation, you're exposed to more UV radiation.	general
Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation.	general
Having more than 50 ordinary moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma.	general
Also, having an unusual type of mole increases the risk of melanoma.	general
Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these tend to be larger than normal moles and have irregular borders and a mixture of colors.	general
Having many moles or unusual moles.	general
If a close relative ‚Äî such as a parent, child or sibling ‚Äî has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too.	general
A family history of melanoma.	general
People with weakened immune systems, such as those who've undergone organ transplants, have an increased risk of skin cancer.	general
Weakened immune system.	general
You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy.	general
Avoid the sun during the middle of the day.	general
You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays.	general
Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer.	general
Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer.	general
Sunscreens don't filter out all harmful UV radiation, especially the radiation that can lead to melanoma.	general
But they play a major role in an overall sun protection program.	general
Wear sunscreen year-round.	general
Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15.	general
Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours ‚Äî or more often if you're swimming or perspiring.	general
The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.	general
Sunscreens don't provide complete protection from UV rays.	general
So cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than a baseball cap or visor does.	general
Wear protective clothing.	general
Some companies also sell photoprotective clothing.	general
A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand.	general
Don't forget sunglasses.	general
Look for those that block both types of UV radiation ‚Äî UVA and UVB rays.	general
Tanning lamps and beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer.	general
Avoid tanning lamps and beds.	general
Examine your skin regularly for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks.	general
Become familiar with your skin so that you'll notice changes.	general
With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp.	general
Examine your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands.	general
Examine both the fronts and backs of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes.	general
Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.	general
Kidney cross section Kidney cross section Blood enters your kidneys through your renal arteries.	general
Your kidneys remove excess fluid and waste material from your blood through units called nephrons.	general
Each nephron contains a filter (glomerulus) that has a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.	general
The glomeruli filter waste products and substances your body needs ‚Äî such as sodium, phosphorus and potassium ‚Äî which then pass through tiny tubules.	general
The substances your body needs are reabsorbed into your bloodstream.	general
The waste products and excess fluid form urine, which flows through the ureters ‚Äî the tubes that lead to the bladder.	general
Membranous nephropathy (MEM-bruh-nus nuh-FROP-uh-thee) occurs when the small blood vessels in the kidney (glomeruli), which filter wastes from the blood, become damaged and thickened.	general
As a result, proteins leak from the damaged blood vessels into the urine (proteinuria).	general
For many, loss of these proteins eventually causes signs and symptoms known as nephrotic syndrome.	general
In mild cases, membranous nephropathy may get better on its own, without any treatment.	general
As protein leakage increases, so does the risk of long-term kidney damage.	general
In many, the disease ultimately leads to kidney failure.	general
There's no absolute cure for membranous nephropathy, but successful treatment can lead to remission of proteinuria and a good long-term outlook.	general
Membranous nephropathy may develop gradually, so you may not suspect that anything is wrong.	general
As you lose protein from your blood, swelling in your legs and ankles and weight gain from excess fluid can occur.	general
Many people have lots of swelling from the very beginning of the disease, but others may not have any severe symptoms until they have advanced kidney disease.	general
Signs and symptoms of membranous nephropathy include: Swelling in the legs and ankles Weight gain Decreased protein in the blood, particularly albumin When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have: Blood in your urine Swelling in your legs and ankles that doesn't go away Increased blood pressure Sudden pain between your upper belly and middle back Sudden shortness of breath, which could be related to a blood clot complication More Information Often, membranous nephropathy results from some type of autoimmune activity.	general
Your body's immune system mistakes healthy tissue as foreign and attacks it with substances called autoantibodies.	general
These autoantibodies target certain proteins located in the kidney's filtering systems (glomeruli).	general
This is known as primary membranous nephropathy.	general
Sometimes membranous nephropathy is brought on by other causes.	general
When this happens, it's called secondary membranous nephropathy.	general
Causes may include: Autoimmune disease, such as lupus erythematosus Infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or syphilis Certain medications, such as gold salts and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Solid cancerous tumors or blood cancers Membranous nephropathy may also occur along with other kidney diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy and rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis.	general
Risk factors Factors that can increase your risk of membranous nephropathy include: Certain diseases and conditions increase your risk of developing membranous nephropathy, such as lupus and other autoimmune diseases.	general
Having a medical condition that can damage your kidneys.	general
Examples of medications that can cause membranous nephropathy include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and gold salts.	general
Use of certain medications.	general
Examples of infections that increase the risk of membranous nephropathy include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis.	general
Exposure to certain infections.	general
Certain genetic factors make it more likely that you'll develop membranous nephropathy.	general
Genetic background.	general
Complications Complications associated with membranous nephropathy include: Levels of cholesterol and triglycerides are often high in people with membranous nephropathy, which greatly increases the risk of heart disease.	general
High cholesterol.	general
With proteinuria, you may lose proteins that help prevent clotting from your blood into your urine.	general
This makes you more prone to having blood clots develop in deep veins or blood clots that travel to your lungs.	general
Blood clots.	general
Waste buildup in your blood (uremia) and salt retention can raise blood pressure.	general
High blood pressure.	general
You're more susceptible to infections when proteinuria causes you to lose immune system proteins (antibodies) that protect you from infection.	general
Infections.	general
High protein levels in the urine, low protein levels in the blood, high blood cholesterol, and swelling (edema) of the eyelids, feet and abdomen occur with this syndrome.	general
Nephrotic syndrome.	general
In cases of severe damage to the kidneys' filtering units (glomeruli), waste products may build up quickly in your blood.	general
You may need emergency dialysis to remove extra fluids and waste from your blood.	general
Acute kidney failure.	general
Your kidneys may gradually lose function over time to the point where you need dialysis or a kidney transplant.	general
Chronic kidney disease.	general
Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can lead to dizzy spells (vertigo) and hearing loss.	general
In most cases, Meniere's disease affects only one ear.	general
Meniere's disease can occur at any age, but it usually starts between young and middle-aged adulthood.	general
It's considered a chronic condition, but various treatments can help relieve symptoms and minimize the long-term impact on your life.	general
Products & Services Signs and symptoms of Meniere's disease include: You have a spinning sensation that starts and stops spontaneously.	general
Episodes of vertigo occur without warning and usually last 20 minutes to several hours, but not more than 24 hours.	general
Severe vertigo can cause nausea.	general
Recurring episodes of vertigo.	general
Hearing loss in Meniere's disease may come and go, particularly early on.	general
Eventually, most people have some permanent hearing loss.	general
Hearing loss.	general
Tinnitus is the perception of a ringing, buzzing, roaring, whistling or hissing sound in your ear.	general
Ringing in the ear (tinnitus).	general
People with Meniere's disease often feel pressure in an affected ear (aural fullness).	general
Feeling of fullness in the ear.	general
After an episode, signs and symptoms improve and might disappear entirely for a while.	general
Over time, the frequency of episodes may lessen.	general
When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of Meniere's disease.	general
These problems can be caused by other illnesses, and it's important to get an accurate diagnosis as soon as possible.	general
Inner ear and balance Inner ear and balance Semicircular canals and otolith organs ‚Äî the utricle and saccule ‚Äî in your inner ear contain fluid and fine, hairlike sensors that help you keep your eyes focused on a target when your head is in motion and assist in helping you maintain your balance.	general
The cause of Meniere's disease is unknown.	general
Symptoms of Meniere's disease appear to be the result of an abnormal amount of fluid (endolymph) in the inner ear, but it isn't clear what causes that to happen.	general
Factors that affect the fluid, which might contribute to Meniere's disease, include: Improper fluid drainage, perhaps because of a blockage or anatomic abnormality Abnormal immune response Viral infection Genetic predisposition Because no single cause has been identified, it's likely that Meniere's disease results from a combination of factors.	general
Complications The unpredictable episodes of vertigo and the prospect of permanent hearing loss can be the most difficult problems of Meniere's disease.	general
The disease can unexpectedly interrupt your life, causing fatigue and stress.	general
Vertigo can cause you to lose balance, increasing your risk of falls and accidents.	general

Three layers of membranes known as meninges protect the brain and spinal cord.	general
The delicate inner layer is the pia mater.	general
The middle layer is the arachnoid, a web-like structure filled with fluid that cushions the brain.	general
The tough outer layer is called the dura mater.	general
A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges ‚Äî the membranes that surround your brain and spinal cord.	general
Although not technically a brain tumor, it is included in this category because it may compress or squeeze the adjacent brain, nerves and vessels.	general
Meningioma is the most common type of tumor that forms in the head.	general
Most meningiomas grow very slowly, often over many years without causing symptoms.	general
But in some instances, their effects on adjacent brain tissue, nerves or vessels may cause serious disability.	general
Meningiomas occur most commonly in women, and are often discovered at older ages, but a meningioma may occur at any age.	general
Because most meningiomas grow slowly, often without any significant signs and symptoms, they do not always require immediate treatment and may be monitored over time.	general
Signs and symptoms of a meningioma typically begin gradually and may be very subtle at first.	general
Depending on where in the brain or, rarely, spine the tumor is situated, signs and symptoms may include: Changes in vision, such as seeing double or blurriness Headaches that worsen with time Hearing loss or ringing in the ears Memory loss When to see a doctor Most signs and symptoms of a meningioma evolve slowly, but sometimes a meningioma requires emergency care.	general
if you have: Seek emergency care Sudden onset of seizures Sudden changes in your vision or memory if you have persistent signs and symptoms that concern you, such as headaches that worsen over time.	general
Make an appointment to see your doctor In many cases, because meningiomas do not cause any noticeable signs or symptoms, they are only discovered as a result of imaging scans done for reasons that turn out to be unrelated to the tumor, such as a head injury, stroke or headaches.	general
It isn't clear what causes a meningioma.	general
Doctors know that something alters some cells in your meninges to make them multiply out of control, leading to a meningioma tumor.	general
Whether this occurs because of genes you inherit, hormones (which may be related to the more frequent occurrence in women), the rare instance of prior exposure to radiation or other factors remains largely unknown.	general
There is no solid evidence to support the assertion that meningiomas occur in association with cellphone use.	general
Risk factors Risk factors for a meningioma include: Radiation therapy that involves radiation to the head may increase the risk of a meningioma.	general
Radiation treatment.	general
Meningiomas are more common in women, leading doctors to believe that female hormones may play a role.	general
Some studies have also suggested a link between breast cancer and meningioma risk related to the role of hormones.	general
Female hormones.	general
The rare disorder neurofibromatosis 2 increases the risk of meningioma and other brain tumors.	general
An inherited nervous system disorder.	general
A high BMI (body mass index) is an established risk factor for many types of cancers, and a higher prevalence of meningiomas among obese persons has been observed in several large studies.	general
But the relationship between obesity and meningiomas is not clear.	general
Complications A meningioma and its treatment, typically surgery and radiation therapy, can cause long-term complications, including: Difficulty concentrating Memory loss Personality changes Your doctor can treat some complications and refer you to specialists to help you cope with other complications.	general
Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes (meninges) surrounding your brain and spinal cord.	general
The swelling from meningitis typically triggers symptoms such as headache, fever and a stiff neck.	general
Most cases of meningitis in the United States are caused by a viral infection, but bacterial, parasitic and fungal infections are other causes.	general
Some cases of meningitis improve without treatment in a few weeks.	general
Others can be life-threatening and require emergency antibiotic treatment.	general
Seek immediate medical care if you suspect that someone has meningitis.	general
Early treatment of bacterial meningitis can prevent serious complications.	general
Early meningitis symptoms may mimic the flu (influenza).	general
Symptoms may develop over several hours or over a few days.	general
Possible signs and symptoms in anyone older than the age of 2 include: Sudden high fever Headache with nausea or vomiting Confusion or difficulty concentrating Signs in newborns Constant crying Poor feeding A bulge in the soft spot on top of a baby's head (fontanel) Stiffness in a baby's body and neck Infants with meningitis may be difficult to comfort, and may even cry harder when held.	general
When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical care if you or someone in your family has meningitis symptoms, such as: Bacterial meningitis is serious, and can be fatal within days without prompt antibiotic treatment.	general
Delayed treatment increases the risk of permanent brain damage or death.	general
It's also important to talk to your doctor if a family member or someone you work with has meningitis.	general
You may need to take medications to prevent getting the infection.	general
Meningitis is an infection and inflammation of the fluid and three membranes (meninges) protecting your brain and spinal cord.	general
The tough outer membrane is called the dura mater, and the delicate inner layer is the pia mater.	general
The middle layer is the arachnoid, a weblike structure containing the fluid and blood vessels covering the surface of the brain.	general
Viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis, followed by bacterial infections and, rarely, fungal infections.	general
Because bacterial infections can be life-threatening, identifying the cause is essential.	general
Bacterial meningitis Bacteria that enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain and spinal cord cause acute bacterial meningitis.	general
But it can also occur when bacteria directly invade the meninges.	general
This may be caused by an ear or sinus infection, a skull fracture, or, rarely, after some surgeries.	general
Several strains of bacteria can cause acute bacterial meningitis, most commonly: This bacterium is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, young children and adults in the United States.	general
It more commonly causes pneumonia or ear or sinus infections.	general
A vaccine can help prevent this infection.	general
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).	general
This bacterium is another leading cause of bacterial meningitis.	general
These bacteria commonly cause an upper respiratory infection but can cause meningococcal meningitis when they enter the bloodstream.	general
This is a highly contagious infection that affects mainly teenagers and young adults.	general
It may cause local epidemics in college dormitories, boarding schools and military bases.	general
A vaccine can help prevent infection.	general
Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus).	general
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacterium was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children.	general
But new Hib vaccines have greatly reduced the number of cases of this type of meningitis.	general
Haemophilus influenzae (haemophilus).	general
These bacteria can be found in unpasteurized cheeses, hot dogs and lunchmeats.	general
Pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are most susceptible.	general
Listeria can cross the placental barrier, and infections in late pregnancy may be fatal to the baby.	general
Listeria monocytogenes (listeria).	general
Viral meningitis Viral meningitis is usually mild and often clears on its own.	general
Most cases in the United States are caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, which are most common in late summer and early fall.	general
Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, HIV, mumps, West Nile virus and others also can cause viral meningitis.	general
Chronic meningitis Slow-growing organisms (such as fungi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that invade the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain cause chronic meningitis.	general
Chronic meningitis develops over two weeks or more.	general
The signs and symptoms of chronic meningitis ‚Äî headaches, fever, vomiting and mental cloudiness ‚Äî are similar to those of acute meningitis.	general
Fungal meningitis Fungal meningitis is relatively uncommon and causes chronic meningitis.	general
It may mimic acute bacterial meningitis.	general
Fungal meningitis isn't contagious from person to person.	general
Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease that affects people with immune deficiencies, such as AIDS.	general
It's life-threatening if not treated with an antifungal medication.	general
Other meningitis causes Meningitis can also result from noninfectious causes, such as chemical reactions, drug allergies, some types of cancer and inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis.	general
Risk factors Risk rises for anyone who hasn't completed the recommended childhood or adult vaccination schedule.	general
Skipping vaccinations.	general
Most cases of viral meningitis occur in children younger than age 5.	general
Bacterial meningitis is common in those under age 20.	general
College students living in dormitories, personnel on military bases, and children in boarding schools and child care facilities are at greater risk of meningococcal meningitis.	general
This is probably because the bacterium is spread by the respiratory route, and spreads quickly through large groups.	general
Living in a community setting.	general
Pregnancy increases the risk of listeriosis ‚Äî an infection caused by listeria bacteria, which may also cause meningitis.	general
Listeriosis increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery.	general
AIDS, alcoholism, diabetes, use of immunosuppressant drugs and other factors that affect your immune system also make you more susceptible to meningitis.	general
Having your spleen removed also increases your risk, and anyone without a spleen should get vaccinated to minimize that risk.	general
Compromised immune system.	general
Complications Meningitis complications can be severe.	general
The longer you or your child has the disease without treatment, the greater the risk of seizures and permanent neurological damage, including: Hearing loss Memory difficulty Learning disabilities Brain damage Gait problems With prompt treatment, even patients with severe meningitis can have good recovery.	general
Common bacteria or viruses that can cause meningitis can spread through coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing eating utensils, a toothbrush or a cigarette.	general
These steps can help prevent meningitis: Careful hand-washing helps prevent the spread of germs.	general
Teach children to wash their hands often, especially before eating and after using the toilet, spending time in a crowded public place or petting animals.	general
Show them how to vigorously and thoroughly wash and rinse their hands.	general
Wash your hands.	general
Don't share drinks, foods, straws, eating utensils, lip balms or toothbrushes with anyone else.	general
Teach children and teens to avoid sharing these items too.	general
Practice good hygiene.	general
Maintain your immune system by getting enough rest, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet with plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains.	general
Stay healthy.	general
When you need to cough or sneeze, be sure to cover your mouth and nose.	general
Cover your mouth.	general
Reduce your risk of listeriosis by cooking meat, including hot dogs and deli meat, to 165 F (74 C).	general
Avoid cheeses made from unpasteurized milk.	general
Choose cheeses that are clearly labeled as being made with pasteurized milk.	general
If you're pregnant, take care with food.	general
Immunizations Some forms of bacterial meningitis are preventable with the following vaccinations: Children in the United States routinely receive this vaccine as part of the recommended schedule of vaccines, starting at about 2 months of age.	general
The vaccine is also recommended for some adults, including those who have sickle cell disease or AIDS and those who don't have a spleen.	general
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine.	general
This vaccine also is part of the regular immunization schedule for children younger than 2 years in the United States.	general
Additional doses are recommended for children between the ages of 2 and 5 who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease, including children who have chronic heart or lung disease or cancer.	general
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13).	general
Older children and adults who need protection from pneumococcal bacteria may receive this vaccine.	general
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the PPSV23 vaccine for all adults older than 65; for younger adults and children age 2 and older who have weak immune systems or chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes or sickle cell anemia; and for anyone who doesn't have a spleen.	general
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23).	general
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that a single dose be given to children ages 11 to 12, with a booster shot given at age 16.	general
If the vaccine is first given between ages 13 and 15, the booster is recommended between ages 16 and 18.	general
If the first shot is given at age 16 or older, no booster is necessary.	general
Meningococcal conjugate vaccine.	general
This vaccine can also be given to children between the ages of 2 months and 10 years who are at high risk of bacterial meningitis or who have been exposed to someone with the disease.	general
It's also used to vaccinate healthy but previously unvaccinated people who have been exposed in outbreaks.	general
